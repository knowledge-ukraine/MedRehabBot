Treatment should be tailored to the individual and involve trial therapy to determine effective strategies and techniques(2)",

Nine patients who had TBI and neurogenic stuttering received therapy sessions that included instruction in slowing speech rate, fluency shaping, stuttering modification, and cognitive stuttering therapy. Four of the patients improved, but lack of improvement was reported for the other patients(6)",
            "The following are approaches that have been tried with patients with neurogenic stuttering; however, at this time, there is not a preferred approach for treatment: \u2013Speech modification approaches (fluency shaping):  The goal of speech modification approaches is to teach the patient to speak more fluently.(23) Speech modification techniques include stretched syllables, controlled rate, slow speech, and smooth speech. Smooth speech, or prolonged speech, is the most commonly used fluency-shaping  approach -Smooth speech/prolonged speech: Prolonged speech is a reduced rate of speech (e.g., drawling speech or legato speech) that has been shown effective in replacing stuttered speech. Some skills involved in prolonged speech include gentle voice onsets, continuous vocalization, reduced rate of tongue and lip movements, prolongation of syllables, controlled pausing, good eye contact, and slow and controlled in-breath.(24) These skills are practiced in increasingly difficult situations such as reading aloud, role-playing,  joke telling, playing games (e.g., \"Who Am I?\"), telling stories about books or movies, or giving a speech in front of a group \u2013A few case studies have reported improved fluency with use of speech modification techniques in patients with neurogenic stuttering: -Authors of a case study of 2 patients who were taking anticonvulsant medication reported that both patients had improvements in their fluency after receiving instruction on speech modification techniques; however, it was unclear if it was the treatment or adjustments in their medication that resulted in improved fluency(25) -A patient with multiple sclerosis received therapy consisting of breathing exercises, progressive relaxation, and cognitive reframing.(26) After treatment the patient showed decreased muscle activity and improved fluency  \u2013Altered auditory feedback (AAF) device: An AAF device provides an electronically altered speech signal so that the speaker hears his or her voice differently. Types of AAF used to improve stuttering include delayed auditory feedback (DAF) and frequency-altered  feedback (FAF). Most individuals with developmental stuttering experience fluency enhancement with DAF and/or FAF -In a study conducted in the United States of 2 patients with neurogenic stuttering, researchers found that DAF had no effect on stuttering in 1 patient and actually increased stuttering in another(1) -Authors of a case study of a patient with neurogenic stuttering indicated that neither DAF nor FAF had any effect on fluency(27) -Other case studies with patients with TBI have been mixed, with one case improving to a high level of fluency with DAF but others showing initial improvement but a loss of fluency after termination of treatment. For 1 patient with PD, fluency was maintained for 1 year but declined after adaptation to the DAF and a loss of beneficial effect occurred(2) .
