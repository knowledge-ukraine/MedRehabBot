            "A cochlear implant (CI) is a small, partially implanted electronic device that provides a person with a profound hearing loss a representation of sound from the environment.(1) A CI contains components that are located outside of a person\u2019s body (external portion) as well as parts that are implanted (implanted portion). The external portion includes a microphone, a sound processor, and a transmitter system, which transmits speech signals to the receiver-stimulator.  The external portion is removable and is powered by batteries, much like traditional hearing aids. The implanted portion includes a receiver-stimulator,  which converts information from the transmitter into electric impulses, and an electrode system. The electrode system, which is threaded through the cochlea, transports the electrical impulses to the auditory nerve. The external and internal systems are held next to each other by an implanted magnet which works through the person\u2019s skin(1,2,3)"

        "indications": [
            "Children who are permanently profoundly deaf or have severe, bilateral hearing impairment are typically good candidates for CIs; however, hearing threshold is only one factor when considering a child\u2019s candidacy for a CI(1,4,61)",
            "Although the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved multichannel CIs for implantation in children as young as 12 months of age, many children younger than 12 months have received CIs off-protocol(5,6) \u2013Authors of a review of the literature found that evidence of the auditory and linguistic benefits of CI implantation outweigh the risks in children under age 12 months with an experienced surgeon and pediatric anesthesiologist(7) \u2013In a retrospective chart review study conducted in Australia, researchers found that better communication development was associated with early implantation. Subjects in the study were 35 children implanted between 6 and 12 months of age and 85 children implanted between 13 and 24 months of age. Outcome measures of language, speech production, and speech perception were taken at 1, 2, 3, and 5 years post implantation; subjects who had been implanted prior to 12 months of age performed significantly better than those who received the CI after 12 months of age(43) \u2013Implantation after 12 months of age is common among children with progressive hearing loss because they often are not candidates for CI at the time their hearing impairment initially is diagnosed. Children with known progressive hearing loss should be monitored frequently to determine when they are appropriate candidates for implantation(56)",
            "Children with the following diagnoses might be candidates for a CI: \u2013Sensorineural hearing loss(3) \u2013Auditory neuropathy(3)  \u2013Meningitis followed by hearing loss(3) \u2013Otosclerosis(3) \u2013Inner ear malformations(3)",
            "Authors of a systematic review of the literature on cochlear implantation for children with unilateral hearing loss published in 2016 reported that CIs for these children might be an effective treatment for improving quality of life and speech perception; however, they were unable to draw firm conclusions due to the variability in study methodologies and the heterogeneity of study findings and outcome measures. There were only 5 articles that met criteria for this systematic review and the studies had small sample sizes(59)",
            "The following risks are associated with CIs \u2013Risks associated with receiving general anesthesia(2) \u2013Facial nerve could become damaged during surgical implantation(2) \u2013Meningitis could occur (especially in individuals with inner ears that are abnormally formed)(2) \u2013Cerebrospinal fluid could leak(2) \u2013Perilymph fluid could leak(2) \u2013Skin wound could become infected(2) \u2013Blood or fluid could collect at the site of surgery(2) \u2013Dizziness or vertigo could develop(2) \u2013Tinnitus(2) \u2013Taste sensation could be disturbed(2) \u2013The ear could become numb(2) \u2013The body could reject the implant, leading to localized inflammation and a reparative granuloma (localized inflammation that occurs if the body rejects the implant)(2) \u2013Sounds might be perceived differently than prior to surgery(2) \u2013Residual hearing will be lost(2) \u2013Long-term  effects are unknown and uncertain(2) \u2013Hearing abilities following surgery vary among patients; results might be disappointing(2) \u2013Language comprehension following surgery varies among patients; results might be disappointing(2) \u2013Certain medical procedures cannot be performed following CI: -MRI (an MRI can dislodge the CI or cause the internal magnet to demagnetize; however, two multichannel CIs exist that can undergo 1.5 Tesla MRI imaging in certain conditions)(2,6) -Neurostimulation(2) -Electrical surgery(2) -Electroconvulsive therapy(2) -Ionic radiation therapy(2) \u2013CI might need to be removed if infection occurs(2) \u2013CI could fail(2) \u2013As CI technology improves, the patient might not be able to upgrade to new CI if new external parts are not compatible with existing internal portion(2) \u2013CI is dependent upon batteries to function(2) \u2013There is a risk of damaging the CI (e.g., external portions might be damaged if they become wet)(2) \u2013Patient might need to make lifestyle changes(2) \u2013Skin might become irritated due to placement of external portions(2) \u2013Strange sounds might be heard when in the presence of magnetic fields (e.g., near airport passenger screening machines)(2)  \u2013There is a large amount of opposition to CI use in the Deaf community. Many members of this community believe that CI use is not culturally responsive in that it prevents CI users from being complete members of the community, implies that deafness is a disability (a belief that the Deaf community adamantly opposes), and implies that Deaf persons are of lesser worth(46,47)"

Specific testing will vary according to the age of the childInfants in the United States are commonly screened for hearing loss shortly after birth (before leaving the hospital or birthing center). An infant\u2019s hearing can be assessed using otoacoustic emissions testing (OAE) and/or auditory brainstem response testing (ABR)(17) -Infant hearing screenings can ensure early cochlear implantation. Authors of a retrospective data review study conducted in New Zealand with 123 children who received a CI between March 2003 and August 2014 reported that the median age of implantation for infants who had received a hearing screening shortly after birth was 13 months. The median age of implantation for the children who did not undergo an infant hearing screening was 24 months(55)If hearing is not screened at birth, the child should be screened at 3 months of age. If a child is at high risk for developing hearing loss (e.g., family history of childhood hearing loss, history of recurrent otitis media), he or she should be rescreened at 6-month  intervals until the age of 3 even if no hearing loss is initially identified(17)Visual examination of the ear canal and tympanic membrane (eardrum)(9,17)Measurement of tympanic membrane mobility(9,17)Measures the volume of air in the ear canal (can be used to identify perforated eardrums or blocks in the ventilation of the ear)(17) Measures the responses of tiny ear muscles when presented with sound at varying intensities(17)OAEs measure the cochlea\u2019s response to sound stimulation. OAEs can identify blockages in the outer ear canals, fluid in the middle ear, and damage to the cochlea\u2019s outer hair cells(18)During ABR testing, electrodes are placed on an infant\u2019s head while sound is presented to his or her ears. The electrodes record the brain\u2019s response (or lack of response) to these sounds. ABRs can be used to identify damage to the cochlea, auditory nerve, and auditory pathways in the brainstem(17)A patient\u2019s ability to hear calibrated pure tones and recognize the presence of speech is measured.(18) This may be done using visual reinforcement audiometry (VRA) or conditioned play audiometry (CPA).(9) VRA is primarily used to test children between the ages of 6 months and 2 years. In VRA, children are trained to look towards lights or toys when they hear a sound presented by the audiologist. After training, when the child looks up upon hearing a sound, he or she is rewarded by the presentation of lights or a moving toy. CPA is primarily used on children between the ages of 2 and 3 years and involves training a child to perform an activity (e.g., placing a block in a box) when hearing a sound(17)Speech perception testing will depend upon the age of the child but may include open-set  word and sentence recognition or closed-set  tasks involving the identification of prosodic features and word identification.(5,9) If age appropriate, speech perception measures should be taken for each ear -Ina study conducted in Taiwan with Mandarin-speaking  children with CIs, researchers found that although there were far fewer tones than speech sounds in Mandarin, tone perception was significantly poorer than speech-sound perception(19)Does the child currently use hearing aids or another form of amplification? How has the patient benefitted from his or her current amplification?(5)If the patient has not previously used amplification, a 3- to 6-month  trial period might be recommended(5)Prior to receiving the CI, a child should use his or her hearing aids during auditory skills assessment. Assess the child\u2019s ability to 1) pay attention to speech and environmental sounds, 2) integrate auditory perception and speech production (i.e., is the child able to imitate sounds that he or she hears?), 3) assign meaning to the sounds he or she hears, and 4) use hearing to engage in communication exchanges.(4) Examples of auditory skill measures include 9)(20) Results are based upon parent/caregiver report.

Includes five hierarchical levels of vocalizations(48) -Many children with early implantation of a CI will progress through articulation and phonological development in the same manner as their normal-hearing  peers.(22) Children with severe-to-profound  hearing loss who have early cochlear implantation are able to obtain phonological awareness abilities (which are essential in order to learn to read) similar to those of children with typical hearing abilities(53) -In a study conducted in the United States with CI implant users aged 9 to 36 months, researchers found that the children developed intonation over a similar amount of time and with a similar pattern to typically developing infants based on the length of hearing experience (i.e., an 18-month-old child who has had a CI for 9 months would be expected to have intonation patterns similar to those of a typically developing 9-month-old  infant). For children who were slightly older when receiving their CI (> 25 months), intonation development was more rapid than expected (i.e., a 36-month-old child with 3 months of CI use might achieve the same intonation developmental level as a typically developing infant does over 6 months of time)(23)  -In a study conducted in Poland of severely, prelingually deaf children under the age of 2 years, researchers found that prosodic development was significantly better in children who used CIs than in those who used hearing aids(24)Assess the child\u2019s ability to express thoughts, wants, and needs vocally, verbally, gesturally, and/or using signed language. Following implantation, it is important to carefully monitor the child\u2019s vocabulary development.(62) Even with early cochlear implantation, children with CI have increased risk of vocabulary delays compared to typically developing peers.(62) A child\u2019s language can be assessed through standardized testing or through the collection of(25) Assesses prelinguistic skills such as communicative functions, use of gestures, reciprocity, and eye gaze.

Three to 5 weeks after surgery (when the physical healing has taken place), the patient receives the external components of the CI. At that time, the external processor is programmed by the patient\u2019s audiologist. Programming might require several visits to complete, and reprogramming is sometimes necessary if the patient experiences changes in his or her ability to hear over time. Electrodes are assigned specific sound frequencies. During programming, each electrode is programmed for a threshold level (the lowest level at which the patient responds to a sound sensation 100% of the time) and for the most comfortable level of loudness. Other parameters that can be adjusted during programming include global loudness levels and speed of transmission(5)",

            "Factors influencing outcome include the following:(2) \u2013Child variables -Length of time that the child has been deaf (shorter periods of deafness lead to more positive outcomes)(2,5,32) -Age at time of deafness/hearing loss (children who became deaf at later ages typically have more positive outcomes)(2,5,32) -Age at implantation (children who undergo implantation at younger ages typically have more favorable outcomes)(2,32,33,44,57) -Early implantation (at ages 1\u20132 years) does not necessarily result in normal language development(34) -In a study conducted in the United States of infants with CIs, researchers found that infants with CIs transition from precanonical vocalizations to speech-like  babbling rapidly despite initial auditory deprivation prior to receiving a CI. Findings of this study showed a significant decrease in precanonical vocalizations and increase in speech-like babbling after 1 year of CI use(35) -Being cognitively, socially, and motorically mature at the time of implantation (compared with a hearing newborn) can contribute to a rapid pace of vocal development(49) -Length of time using implant: children who used a CI for longer periods of time during infancy and very early childhood had more favorable spoken language outcomes(2,32,33,36) -In a study conducted in the United States, researchers compared outcomes in 9 English-speaking  children who received CIs before 30 months of age at 3, 4, and 5 years postimplantation(41) -9 typically developing peers were used as control subjects -Outcome measure was the use of correct tense marking in a story retell task -The percent of correct tense marking increased significantly over time for both groups of children (those with CIs and those who were typically developing) -As a group, the children with CIs at 3 years postimplantation had similar accuracy of tense marking compared with typically developing children; however, accuracy was significantly lower for the children with CIs at 4 and 5 years postimplantation.(41) There was considerable individual variability among the children with CIs throughout the study; some of the children with CIs performed similarly to typically developing peers at all testing points(41) -Patient\u2019s learning aptitude/nonverbal intelligence(2,32,57) -Health and structure of the patient\u2019s cochlea(2) -Patient\u2019s amount of residual hearing pre-implant(5) -Patient\u2019s lip-reading  ability(5) \u2013Implant variables -Type of speech processor(2,32) -Larger numbers of active electrodes in the CI map lead to better outcomes(2,32) -A precise and accurate map is associated with more positive outcomes(32) -Bilateral or unilateral implantation -Bilateral implantation is associated with better sound localization and speech recognition in noise(54,57) -In a study conducted in the United States with 36 children who had been implanted either bilaterally or unilaterally at some point between ages 10 and 23 months, researchers found that at 12 months postimplantation, overall vocabulary size did not differ between children with unilateral versus bilateral CIs. The children with bilateral CIs had much more sensitive word-level  statistical patterns of spoken language (e.g., words with rare sound sequences and dense neighborhoods) than did those with a unilateral CI. The sensitivity of the children with bilateral CIs was close to that of a child with normal hearing. Because sensitivity to these patterns is associated with the ability to learn new sounds, vocabulary, and sentence structures, researchers concluded that future acquisition of spoken language is likely to be stronger in the children with bilateral CIs(52)  \u2013Rehabilitation program variables -Mode of communication used in the child\u2019s educational setting(32) -Enrollment in an oral education program leads to more positive outcomes in auditory and speech skill development(32) -High level of parental involvement(37,38) -Parental use of spoken language at home(38)",

Typically hearing children were assessed at 6, 9, and 12months of age. Children with CIs were assessed at 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post CI activation. Following the conclusion of this study, researchers reported that following implantation young CI users used fewer non-speech-like vocalizations more quickly than typically hearing children and they began to use basic canonical syllables more quickly than younger, typically hearing children. The authors of this study suggest that this rapid development in older children with CIs might be due to motor, cognitive, neurological, and social maturity at time of implantation (when compared to typically developing infants)(50)",
            "Following study of 12 young children who had received CIs prior to age 3 years and 11 typically developing children, researchers concluded that during the second year of CI use vocal development in CI users continues to occur at a faster rate than in younger, typically developing children(49)"

            "Twelve guiding principles have been suggested based upon research findings and clinical experience(37) \u2013The infant or toddler with a CI must learn to attach meaning to what is heard through his or her CI(37) \u2013The ultimate goal for children with CIs is that they become competent communicators(37) \u2013Skills learned in a therapy setting must be transferred into the classroom, home, and other natural settings(37) \u2013Rehabilitation sessions should integrate goals of speech, language, auditory perception, and pragmatics within an environment that has appropriate social/emotional context(37) \u2013Almost all children with CIs require a combination of direct teaching of specific auditory skills and incidental learning to acquire spoken language(37) \u2013A diagnostic teaching approach to CI therapy yields the most benefit. This approach determines what a child can currently do and then challenges the child to perform at the next level of difficulty while identifying factors that facilitate or hinder performance(37) \u2013Material from the child\u2019s educational program should be used during rehabilitation/therapy sessions(37) \u2013Music should be integrated into rehabilitation sessions since music perception is closely related to speech and other auditory perception(37) -In a study conducted in Taiwan, researchers found that music training helped improve pitch perception in children with CIs who were prelingually deaf(39) \u2013Infants and toddlers with CIs have unique needs that differ from the needs of older children with CIs(37) \u2013Established auditory milestones can be used as \u201cred flags\u201d to identify children who are progressing at slower than expected rates.(40) These red flags include:(14) -Child is not using his or her CI full-time  (i.e., all waking hours except when in water) 1 month after initial stimulation(14) -Child does not display a change in the quality or quantity of his or her vocalizations after 3 months of CI use(14) -Child displays skills during audiological testing that he or she does not display in everyday situations(14) -Child is not spontaneously alerting to his or her name after 6 months of CI use(14) -Child is not responding to environmental sounds after 6 months of CI use(14) -Child does not display evidence that he or she is deriving meaning from sound after 12 months of device use(14)  \u2013Formal assessment tools might not adequately capture a child\u2019s difficulties in the areas of inference, problem solving, and topic shifts; therefore, they should not be used in isolation(37)",
            "Parent/caregiver training \u2013Since parents/caregivers play a critical role in fostering the speech and language development in infants and toddlers with CIs, aural rehabilitation for this age group should involve the family as a whole(37,40) \u2013SLPs and/or aural rehabilitation specialists must be able to identify and describe a young child\u2019s communication behaviors to the parent/caregiver(40) \u2013Parents/caregivers should be taught methods for stimulating developmentally appropriate communication behaviors while they interact with their child(40)",
            "Considerations for working with infants and toddlers with CIs \u2013When working with infants and toddlers, it is critical that therapy activities are centered around the whole family rather than the individual child(14) \u2013Therapy materials and procedures must be developmentally appropriate for infants and toddlers (e.g., use of real objects rather than pictures of objects during therapy sessions, use of vocabulary and syntax that a young child would understand)(14) \u2013Infants and toddlers present with behavior and compliance issues not seen in older children(14) \u2013Therapy sessions should focus on incidental learning rather than didactic instruction(14) \u2013The home is recognized as the primary language learning environment(14) \u2013When working with infants it is critical to emphasize the prosody and suprasegmental aspects of speech (e.g., pitch, speech rate, varying loudness levels) rather than focusing on vocabulary or grammar development. The social and emotional content of language is conveyed through prosody and is considered to be the most important linguistic information for an infant to learn(14,37) \u2013Therapy activities should be play-based  and focus on helping parents foster functional communication in everyday situations(37)",
            "Communication mode:  Families with infants and toddlers with CIs will need to decide on a mode of communication to use with their child. Typically, communication modes used with children with CIs are either oral communication (OC) or total communication (TC) \u2013Oral communication:  OC focuses on using speech and audition to communicate. Auditory input is used to monitor the accuracy of an individual\u2019s own speech production and to understand spoken language. OC methods exist along a continuum with varying emphasis placed on the use of auditory versus visual channels to receive spoken information. For example, when using a cued speech mode of communication, a child gains valuable information from hand positions used in conjunction with lip-reading;  however, when using an auditory-verbal approach, a child is encouraged to rely exclusively on auditory information(32) \u2013Total communication:  TC methods incorporate the use of both signed language and the development of speech and auditory skills. TC methods vary in the extent to which English grammar is emphasized as well in the extent to which speech, audition, and lip-reading  skills are emphasized(32)",
            "Short periods of prelinguistic input (SPPI)  (40) \u2013The goal of SPPI is to assist children as they progress from precanonical to canonical and postcanonical levels of babbling. It is hoped that the establishment of these early developing phonetic skills will support the development of phonological and lexical skills(40) \u2013Parents/caregivers/SLP begin by modeling vocalizations that the child is currently able to produce and then model more complex forms of babbling \u2013Parent/caregiver models target vocalizations for 1-minute  periods 5 times per day, repeating the vocalization once every 5 seconds(40) \u2013SPPI is performed as vocal play during interactions that should be enjoyable to both the child and parent/caregiver(40) \u2013SPPI is intended to be used as a strategy in conjunction with interventions focusing on developing meaningful speech and language skills(40)  \u2013Although the effectiveness of SPPI has not yet been researched, the use of modeling is an accepted method of teaching speech and language to young children. Additionally, SPPI provides a systematic way to encourage early speech development(40) .
