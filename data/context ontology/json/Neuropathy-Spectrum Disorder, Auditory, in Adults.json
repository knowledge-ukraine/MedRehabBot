            "Prior to 2008, there was no consensus regarding the terminology for auditory neuropathy/dyssynchrony. The terms auditory neuropathy and auditory dyssynchrony were used interchangeably in research studies to refer to the potential neural involvement as well as the lack of synchrony in the auditory system.(1) However, in 2008, a group of audiologists, hearing scientists, medical geneticists, neonatologists, and neurologists met in Como, Italy, for the Consensus Conference on Auditory Neuropathy/ Dyssynchrony. This panel recommended the term auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD) to refer to the continuum of hearing impairment in which a patient\u2019s otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) are (or were at some time) present and the auditory brainstem response (ABR) is absent or abnormal.(2) ANSD includes hearing loss caused by damage to the hair cells (sensory hearing loss), damage to the spiral ganglion cells/VIIIth cranial nerve (auditory neuropathy), and hearing loss caused by damage to the central auditory pathway, which includes the cochlear nucleus, inferior colliculus, medial geniculate body, and auditory cortex (central hearing loss)(2,3)"

The purpose of assessment is to determine the presence of ANSD and to assess the patient\u2019s language, listening, and speech abilities if necessary. The primary diagnostic features  of ANSD are: 1) normal outer hair cell function as demonstrated by preserved OAEs, 2) an absence of neural synchrony as shown by absent MEMRs, 3) absent or irregular ABRs, and 4) poor speech perception, particularly in the presence of noise.(4) The audiologist is also responsible for monitoring the use of amplification (if applicable) and evaluating the need for a cochlear implant. The SLP is responsible for assessing language, speech, and listening abilities and providing aural rehabilitation when needed. A neurologist might provide assessment input on other peripheral neuropathies.(15)The following audiological diagnostic assessments are performed by a qualified audiologist \u2013Diagnostic measures -ABR:  An ABR test measures brain wave activity in the acoustic centers of the brain in response to a brief external stimulus. An ABR test should be performed with click stimuli at reasonably high levels (70\u201380dB nHL), comparing averages collected to a positive polarity versus a negative polarity click.(7,9) Patients with ANSD exhibit no response or abnormal morphology ABR at elevated levels starting with wave 1.(16) However, a lack of ABR does not necessarily mean an absence of hearing sensitivity, and there are documented cases of patients who have had few problems learning language who had no recordable ABRs(7) -In a study conducted in India with 149 subjects with ANSD, researchers found that having a preserved ABR was associated with better speech perception in both noisy and quiet environments. In this study, the ABR was preserved in only 12.5% of the ears assessed(51) -OAEs:  An OAE is a release of sound energy in the cochlea and can indicate normal outer hair cell function. The diagnosis of ANSD is confirmed if OAEs are present in combination with an absent ABR. However, in some patients with ANSD, OAEs disappear for no apparent reason, and ANSD cannot be completely ruled out when there are no OAEs.(9) Middle ear problems can prevent measurement of OAEs because the low-amplitude  signal might be blocked or reduced(4) -Cochlear microphonics (CMs):  In the presence of middle ear problems, it might not be possible to use OAEs. In this case, CMs might be used to evaluate outer hair cell function. Electrodes are used to measure electrical response after presentation of an external acoustic stimulus. These electrodes are attached to the scalp and therefore bypass the middle ear system.(4) CMs should be present at 90 and 80 dBnHL(17) -Standard pure-tone  and speech audiometry:  A complete peripheral hearing evaluation should evaluate hearing thresholds. Patients with ANSD vary greatly with respect to type and degree of hearing loss, ranging from normal hearing sensitivity to profound hearing loss.(2,16) The loss usually is bilateral, but some unilateral cases have been described.(18) Most patients with ANSD will have poor speech recognition results even if the pure-tone  audiometric results are not poor; accuracy of speech recognition in noise will likely be worse than in quiet(2,9) -Otoscopic exam:  An otoscopic evaluation should be performed to examine the external ear canal and tympanic membrane for any abnormalities. It is critical to rule out middle ear pathologies that might affect test outcomes(16) -MEMRs:  The acoustic reflex is important for differential diagnosis of ANSD. Ipsilateral and contralateral MEMRs should be absent in patients with ANSD. If these reflexes are present, ANSD should be ruled out; however, the absence of a reflex does not definitively confirm the diagnosis of ANSD(4) -Auditory steady-state  response:  Evoked by a binaural multifrequency (500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz) paradigm in which 4 electrodes are used (a positive electrode high on the forehead, a ground electrode on the lower forehead, and 2 negative electrodes on the mastoids) to record the auditory steady-state  response; monaural tests can be performed if there is no response to binaural stimulation.(19) The auditory steady-state  response will be present in most patients with ANSD and can be an important diagnostic measure, especially in the absence of ABRs(19,20) -Cortical auditory evoked potentials (CAEPs):  CAEPs are a subtype of event-related  potentials (ERPs) (brain responses to some type of event; e.g., sound). CAEPs are very small electrical voltage potentials (2\u201310  microvolts) that originate from the brain in response to an auditory stimulus (e.g., tones, speech sounds). Recorded by electrodes on the scalp, CAEPs are not routinely used in diagnostics with individuals with ANSD; however, a growing body of research indicates they would be a useful clinical tool(21,22) \u2013Other measures -Auditory performance (hearing handicap assessments):  There are several patient self-assessment  measures that can be used to establish baseline auditory performance and quality of life as well as to assess therapy outcomes. The following are some examples:  -Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults (HHIA): A self-assessment  tool designed to quantify any posttreatment change in psychosocial perceptions related to hearing loss. This might be used for adults of all ages, including those who are still working(23) -Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly (HHIE): A self-administered questionnaire to assess the emotional and social effects of hearing loss. It can be used to assess posttreatment attitude change toward hearing loss(24) -HHIE-SO:  Assesses the effects of hearing loss from the perspective of a family member(25) -Speech and language assessments:  To be completed by the SLP; assess for speech and language impairments as needed. Use standardized and nonstandardized assessments to evaluate comprehension and production of language in oral, signed, or written modalities. Assess communication strategies, speech reading, and listening skills as indicated(26)",

            "Amplification: Because ANSD involves significant processing dysfunction, amplification may or may not be helpful for patients with ANSD. Case studies provide preliminary support for use of hearing aids in children with ANSD, but adults have shown little to no perceptual advantage with amplification.(29) A trial can be initiated with loaned hearing aids when available \u2013In a study conducted in India, researchers examined the effect of hearing aid use in 64 adult participants with late-onset ANSD (i.e., postlingual). The extent to which ANSD affected each participant varied, and there were cases of bilateral, asymmetrical, and unilateral hearing loss. Researchers tested the effects of amplification in both ears of those with bilateral loss and in the better or unaffected ears of those with asymmetrical or unilateral loss, for a total of 104 ears. Researchers found that hearing aids resulted in improved speech perception for 39 of the 104 ears and the degree of improvement ranged from 4% to 52%. In the other 65 participants and in 5 subjects who had congenital ANSD, there was no improvement from hearing aid use(49) \u2013In a study conducted in India involving 12 adult patients with auditory neuropathy, researchers found that envelope enhancement of the speech signal (a means of enhancing some speech sounds, e.g., consonants, while compressing  others, e.g., vowels) resulted in improved speech recognition for those patients with mild, moderate, and severe auditory neuropathy; those with profound auditory neuropathy did not benefit(30) -Researchers concluded that the use of hearing aids that utilize envelope enhancement technology might result in better speech recognition for patients with mild, moderate, and severe auditory neuropathy(30) \u2013In a study conducted in India with 8 subjects with ANSD, researchers found that when they manipulated the temporal aspects of speech, this resulted in significantly improved speech perception. Using a computer to stretch speech signals by different amounts (25%, 35%, 50%), researchers found that stretching the signal by 25% (but not beyond this) resulted in significantly improved consonant and vowel perception by the individuals with ANSD. Researchers suggested that this information could be used to develop a software algorithm to program hearing aids for persons with ANSD that would improve speech perception(53)",
            "Clear speech:  Two studies conducted in the United States have shown that the use of \u201cclear speech\u201d by a conversational partner increases the speech recognition by persons with hearing loss of varied etiologies.(31,32) Simply instructing a conversational partner to \u201cspeak clearly\u201d has led to better ability to write or repeat sentences that are presented to subjects with hearing loss. Additionally, in a study conducted in Canada, researchers found that specific instructions to a patient\u2019s partner (45 min/1 session) on how to produce clear speech by slowing speech rate, pausing, key word identification, and placing acoustic stress on key words led to more consistent use of clear speech even in postintervention follow-up  sessions (1 month) when compared to another subject who was simply instructed to \u201cspeak clearly.\u201d(33) In a study conducted in the United States with 13 participants with ANSD, researchers investigated the effects of clear speech on understanding and found an overall clear-speech  advantage for a wide range of listening conditions and modes.(34) Other compensatory techniques include facing the patient directly to ensure his/her attention, speaking at a normal volume while clearly enunciating (without using exaggerated lip movement), avoiding covering mouth with hand, and making sure that hearing aids are in place and that eyeglasses are worn, if appropriate(35)",
            "Cochlear implant:  Many children with ANSD who have received cochlear implants have shown improvement in speech perception abilities; however, adults with ANSD who have received cochlear implants have demonstrated mixed results in speech perception outcomes(7,36) \u2013Few studies have systematically investigated the effects of cochlear implants in adults with ANSD. In a retrospective analysis study conducted in South Korea with 11 adult patients with ANSD and 9 with sensorineural hearing loss without neural pathology, researchers found that even when it was impossible to use electrical stimulation to generate a sufficiently synchronized signal for eliciting evoked auditory brainstem response, a cochlear implant did provide at least some measurable auditory benefit in ANSD.(42) An anecdotal report by one researcher indicated that 2 patients in whom ANSD was diagnosed in their 20s received benefit from cochlear implantation.(6) The authors of a case study of adults with and without cochlear implants concluded that implant users with ANSD performed better on speech recognition tasks than nonimplant users(34) \u2013Authors of a systematic review including 27 studies investigating the effect of cochlear implants on speech recognition skills in children with ANSD found that the current evidence is compatible with favorable outcomes, but this evidence is weak and further investigation is necessary.(46) In a study conducted in the United States with 9 children (ages 7\u201318 years) with ANSD who were experienced cochlear implant users, researchers found consistent improvement in speech recognition thresholds (SRTs) with the use of a contralateral hearing aid for amplification.(37) In a retrospective chart review study conducted in the United States that included 26 pediatric cochlear implant users with the diagnosis of auditory neuropathy, researchers found that children with a diagnosis of auditory neuropathy alone performed comparably to their peers with cochlear hearing loss, but the presence of a comorbid cognitive or developmental disorder was associated with significantly poorer outcomes with the cochlear implant.(41) In a retrospective chart review study conducted in the United States with 26 patients over a 14-year  period, researchers found that children with ANSD who failed to develop auditory skills while using a hearing aid were able to develop auditory skills comparable to those of children with ANSD who were successful with hearing aid use after receiving either unilateral or bilateral cochlear implants.(43) In a study conducted in the United States with children with ANSD, researchers compared data from a current and previous study on cochlear implantation in ANSD and determined that abnormal cortical responses were seen in patients with ANSD who were fitted with hearing aids, but not with cochlear implants, suggesting that cochlear implants are more effective for providing the auditory stimulation necessary for central auditory maturation in children  with severe disruptions in neural synchrony.(47) In a case study with a male child aged 11 years, 7 months with a unilateral cochlear implant, authors described improved spatial hearing after the child received a second cochlear implant(44) \u2013In a case study with two patients with postlingual ANSD, researchers found that after 6 months with a cochlear implant, both patients demonstrated improvement in hearing ability. One patient, a 28-year-old  female, made significant progress in speech recognition scores in quiet and in noise. The other patient, a 15-year-old  male, improved slightly in single-word recognition, but continued to have poor sentence recognition scores in both quiet and noisy environments(50)",
            "Auditory training:  Auditory training is a process to train a person with hearing loss to make use of his or her residual hearing by using activities that focus on increasing the recognition, identification, and interpretation of sound. There is no experimental research on the efficacy of auditory training in adults with ANSD, but the research on adults with other types of hearing loss suggests that auditory training might be beneficial in increasing awareness of acoustic differences and recognizing fine acoustic distinctions(38,39) . Problem Goal Intervention Expected Progression Home Program Difficulty understanding speech in various environmentsEnhance the listening environment to improve access to information in all necessary environments (e.g., the workplace, home, school)Reduce adverse acoustic conditions _ Home and/or work modifications that might help to enhance listening include use of barrier walls for working independently, use of sound-absorbing materials such as carpet and draperies, acoustic ceiling tiles, tennis balls on chair legs in rooms without carpet, and seating away from noise sources (e.g., air conditioners, overhead projectors, doorways, windows)(27)N/A For adults, counseling of the patient and family members is considered critical in implementing environmental modifications Difficulty understanding conversational partnerImprove understanding of conversational partner (e.g., spouse of person with hearing loss) by instructing partner on the use of \u201cclear speech\u201dClear speech _ Instruct patient\u2019s family and other conversational partner(s) to learn and use aspects of \u201cclear speech\u201d that include slowing speech rate, pausing, key word identification, and placing acoustic stress on key words(31,32,33,34) _ _ See Treatment summary , aboveSLP guides the patient and conversational partners through clear speech at the word level, then phrase, sentence, and conversation levelsPatient\u2019s conversational partner(s) should use clear speech at home and within the community  Difficulties in expressive/receptive language and readingImprove the individual\u2019s ability to communicate more effectively in everyday environments (e.g., school, work)Auditory training _ See Treatment summary , aboveGradual progression from training the patient to listen to small amounts of information up to participation in conversational speechContinue prescribed exercises at home as indicated ."
