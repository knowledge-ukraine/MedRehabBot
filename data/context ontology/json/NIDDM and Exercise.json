            "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2), formerly called adult-onset  diabetes and non-insulin-dependent  diabetes mellitus, is a chronic metabolic disorder of gradual onset characterized by insulin resistance (i.e., abnormal response of cells to insulin, thus preventing transport of glucose into cells)and relative impairment in insulin pancreatic production. Onset is usually in adults older than 40 years, but rates of DM2 are increasing in children and adolescents as rates of pediatric obesity increase(1,2)",
            "Strong evidence supports the beneficial effects of structured aerobic-exercise  training (AET) programs for reducing hyperglycemia due to insulin resistance. Strength-training exercise programs are also effective for improving glycemic control in persons with DM2(1)",
            "Lifestyle interventions that increase general physical activity and promote modest weight loss can significantly lower the risk of developing or worsening DM2 in high-risk  populations(1,2,3,4)"
