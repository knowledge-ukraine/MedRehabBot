            "Cri du chat syndrome (CdCS) is a genetic disorder in which an infant presents with a high-pitched  cry, microcephaly (small head circumference), delayed communication development, broad nasal bridge, epicanthal folds (folds of skin in the inner eye corners), abnormal dermatoglyphics (e.g., fingerprints, palm prints), severe psychomotor deficits, and, often, intellectual disability.(1,2,3) Behavioral characteristics of CdCS include self-injurious  behavior, obsessive attachment to objects, hyperacusis (hypersensitivity to sound), stubbornness, and clumsiness.(4) Neonatal problems include low birth weight, asphyxia (inability to breathe), cyanotic crises (bluish color of skin due to deoxygenated hemoglobin), impaired sucking ability, and hypotonia (low tone).(3) Recurrent respiratory and intestinal infections are also common in infancy. The following malformations often are present: cardiac, neurological, and renal abnormalities; preauricular tags (small skin tag in front of ear); syndactyly (e.g., fused fingers); hypospadias (abnormally placed urinary meatus); and cryptorchidism (absence of one or both testes from the scrotum)(3)"

In addition, family priorities for treatment should be considered when deciding upon assessment procedures(7)",

            "speech and language examination": "Document the mode(s) of communication used at home and in the educational setting (if applicable). Patients with CdCS exhibit variation in their communication development, but all have delayed speech and language development. Some patients will communicate by gesture, sign language, or using AAC while others can communicate in single words or short multiword sentences. Some patients with CdCS never develop spoken language.(10) Receptive language skills have been noted to be stronger than expressive language skills(10)Patients with CdCS often exhibit articulation that is imprecise and sometimes unintelligible.(10) Substitutions, omissions, and distortions of consonants and vowels are frequent. Consonant inventories and syllable shapes are restricted and vowels are variable.(10,13)Because articulation skills can be so impaired, some researchers have noted that nonverbal communication skills (e.g., facial expression) are a relative strength for patients with CdCS.(31) Articulation skills can be assessed using standardized assessments and/or by obtaining and analyzing a speech sample. The speech sample may have to be restricted to the elicitation of functional words that the child knows due to a reduced  vocabulary and lack of spontaneous utterances.(14) For some young, shy children, documentation of a consonant inventory might rely on parent report -In a study conducted in Norway with 8 children with CdCS (ages 4;6 to 12;3), researchers examined consonant production and speech intelligibility of these children.(32) To elicit consonant productions, researchers utilized a noun elicitation task; the stimuli for each child were not the same because of the heterogeneity of the sample, but researchers chose target words that elicited consonant productions in the initial, medial, and final positions. In this sample of children, all spoke an eastern variety of Norwegian except 1 child, who spoke a southern dialect of Norwegian. All elicitations were recorded and transcribed to evaluate articulation errors and estimate intelligibility. Analysis of speech samples revealed extensive variation in consonant inventories as well as speech intelligibility. Of the 8 children in the study, 1 was rated as \u201chigh\u201d for speech intelligibility, 2 as \u201cmedium,\u201d and 5as \u201clow.\u201d Researchers also noted that labial stops were present for all children, and rhotic sounds and sibilants occurred infrequently(32)Document the presence or absence of echolalia or any other repetition of words, phrases, or sounds. Echolalia is common among patients with CdCS(4,11)Assess the patient\u2019s receptive and expressive language skills using standardized language tests or language sampling, as appropriate. The impact of cognitive and motor impairments on a patient\u2019s ability to respond to test questions should be taken into consideration. Language sampling, parent report, and observation of play might be the most helpful language assessment procedures for children with CdCS. Language of children with CdCS has been characterized as having a reduced mean length of utterance (MLU), a high percentage of one-word  utterances, a large number of word omissions, incorrect word order, and use of rote phrases.(15) Expressive language skills are usually weaker than receptive language skills; however, there is also great variability among individuals -Authors of a case study of a child with CdCS indicated that in this child a small portion of utterances were complex and there was considerable lexical diversity(15) -Authors of a case study of a 14-year-old  Norwegian child with CdCS found that although her phonological and syntactic skills were poor, she had mastered some aspects of morphology. She inflected words of different classes with 98% accuracy in obligatory contexts, and the errors she did make were incorrect gender in nominal forms of the word and occasional use of inaccurate verb form. In a past-tense  elicitation task, however, the child performed poorly and her score was worse than what would have been expected from a typically developing 4-year-old  learning Norwegian(16)Assess interaction patterns of a child with CdCS and parent(s)/caregiver(s). Document positioning that is/is not facilitative to communication, the existence or absence of communication opportunities, and the ability of the parent/caregiver to respond to the child\u2019s communicative signals. Research has shown that children with CdCS demonstrate high levels of distractibility and a low level of object-directed behavior during play(17)Document any feeding difficulties the child has. Children with CdCS often have feeding difficulties and gastroesophageal reflux(3)Document any abnormal muscle function that may affect communication. Children with CdCS often have hypotonia at a young age and then hypertonia as they mature(3)Document any abnormalities in oral motor function, velopharyngeal function, and laryngeal function. The high vocal pitch is most likely due to the malformation of the larynx, which is small, narrow, and diamond shaped. In addition, the epiglottis is small and hypotonic.(3) Patients with CdCS often present with malocclusion, hyper-  and hypotonia, and delayed motor development, all of which may affect oral motor function.(10) In addition, some patients have been noted to have problems with velopharyngeal function.(10) Use informal or formal assessment to record any deficits in oral mechanism form or function and their effect on speech communication \u2013In a descriptive study conducted in Spain with 33 patients (ages 2\u201335,  average age 14.65) with CdCS, researchers found -Weak sucking ability(18) -Hypotonia of the perioral muscles(18) -Epicanthus (vertical fold of skin on either side of the nose, sometimes covering the inner canthus; i.e., the area where the upper and lower eyelids meet)(18) -Hypertelorism (abnormally increased distance between organs; in this case, the separation typically was noted between the patients\u2019 eyes)(18)  -Short philtrum (the vertical groove in the middle area of the upper lip)(18) -Low-set  ears(18) -Facial asymmetry(18) -Strabism (crossed eyes)(18) -High-arched  palate(18) -Malocclusions -Convex profile with maxillary mandibular retrognathism (abnormal posterior positioning of the jaw bones)(18) -Anterior open bite(18) -Other dental abnormalities (e.g., enamel deficiencies, transposed teeth)(18,33)Document any results of vision examinations. Myopia and cataracts often are reported in patients with CdCS. In addition, vision can be affected by hypersensitivity of the pupil due to a defect of the pupil dilator muscle(3)The absence of functional communication can significantly impact an individual\u2019s ability to participate in activities of daily living. During an assessment, the SLP should consider ways to support a patient\u2019s participation in activities of daily living (e.g., eating, playing, getting dressed). This should be done in collaboration with the patient, family/caregiver, other medical personnel, and school/work staff.(8) Standardized parent interviews of child\u2019s daily living skills (e.g., Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales) can provide information in a variety of domains(19)",

Cognitive abilities, such as attention, perception, memory, reasoning, problem solving, and executive functioning, should also be evaluated.(8) Cognitive testing should be done by a neuropsychologist with experience working with persons with CdCS since IQ tests that depend upon fine motor responses and verbal communication are not valid for this population due to the presence of communication delay and fine and gross motor deficits",

            "Use of sign language:  Receptive language has been found to be stronger than expressive language for individuals with CdCS; in addition, many individuals (23\u201350%)  never develop functional oral language.(4) For those individuals who have unintelligible speech, sign language should be explored as a way to support communication. Authors of a case study of two children with CdCS found that the use of both speech and sign language together led to an increase in intelligibility over speech or sign alone. The two children demonstrated some hand-shapes  that deviated from the target hand-shape  in formation of signs; however, their production of signs was consistent(13)",
            "Operant learning principles/graduated guidance: In a multiple baseline study conducted in the United States, researchers examined the effects of a parent-delivered  treatment based upon operant learning principles. One child with CdCS was taught two functional skills: eating and ball rolling.(28) Parent-implemented  procedures included principles of graduated guidance as described by Lovaas.(29) Graduated guidance is a technique involving physical prompting to lead a patient through a series of behaviors to achieve a target behavior. Prompts used in this case study included hand-over-hand guidance, hand-to-elbow  guidance, and a shadow prompt (parents\u2019 hand above the child\u2019s without touching). The last level was a \u201cno prompt\u201d condition. At baseline, the child was unable to demonstrate appropriate ball rolling or eating skills. After treatment, the child showed significant improvements in both tasks, and at 1-year follow-up the child maintained results with 100% accuracy in eating performance (able to eat independently with all meals) and 90% in ball rolling (able to roll ball to mother). Results are promising for the use of operant principles for children with CdCS but preliminary due to the limited evidence of one case study . Problem Goal Intervention Expected Progression Home Program Delayed communicationIncrease the child\u2019s communication and interaction with caregiversEarly intervention _ Early intervention for children with CdCS might include parent training on communication facilitation activities, such as imitation, following the child\u2019s intent and lead, use of extended turn-taking in play, use of picture exchange or sign language to facilitate communication, and use of gestures(1) _ _ For detailed information on language intervention for infants, toddlers, and preschoolers, see the series of Clinical Reviews on this topicThe child will increase communicative interaction with parent/ caregiverParents and caregivers should participate in early intervention goal setting and treatment  Delayed communication and delayed daily living skillsIncrease communication ability while increasing functional daily living skillsOperant learning principles _ Operant learning principles have been found to be successful for teaching children with severe and multiple disabilities.(28) Techniques include using reinforcers (e.g., food) and graduated guidance, which involves a series of prompts that are gradually faded. Parents can be instructed to implement these principles at home to target daily living skills in context (e.g., eating).

In addition, lack of public awareness of the syndrome led to negative reactions among the public. Because there are no physical features that clearly distinguish a child over the age of 2 with CdCS, the child's behaviors often are misperceived as being deliberately rude \u2013Many mothers received uneven medical and social services due to perceived prejudice against individuals with intellectual disabilities \u2013Mothers expressed frustration at the difficulty in accessing the appropriate social services \u2013Mothers reported that they had to continually advocate for themselves and press for adequate social services",
