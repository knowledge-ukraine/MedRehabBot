            "The tibialis posterior muscle originates at the posterior surface of the interosseous membrane, the posterior surface of the tibia, and the medial surface of the fibula. The posterior tibialis tendon (PTT) travels distally and posteriorly to the medial malleolus. It then splits into 3 components: primary, plantar, and recurrent. The main portion inserts on the navicular bone, the plantar portion inserts onto the base of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th metatarsals along with the 2nd and 3rd cuneiforms and the cuboid. The recurrent portion inserts at the sustentaculum tali of the calcaneus(8)",

Patients were instructed to pull their first metatarsal head toward the calcaneus without toe flexion or extension (causing activation of extrinsic muscles) along with the elevation ofMLA and shortening oftheir involved foot in an anterior-posterior  direction. They were also asked to place the forefoot and heel on the ground during holding (isometric contraction) time. During the first week, neuromuscular electrostimulation was used to assist in activation of the intrinsic muscles  \u2013Although the exercise program failed at changing the structural deformity (increase MLA height), it did have positive effects on changing the activation patterns for the tibialis anterior muscle and the fibularis longus muscle. These often present with an abnormal compensatory muscle activation in patients with posterior tibialtendon dysfunction \u2013Clinicians should consider using both SFE and extrinsic muscle strengthening over a longer training period to produce more beneficial results",
            "Calcaneal-cuboid  manipulation was found to immediately reduce symptoms and increase function in a patient with posterior tibialis tendinopathy in a 2015 case report(7) \u2013Initial treatment (prior to the manipulation) consisted of stretching, soft tissue mobilization, therapeutic exercise, and taping \u2013After minimal gains were made, manipulation was performed with patient prone while therapist used an internal rotation directed high velocity, low amplitude thrust at the calcaneal-cuboid  joint \u2013Immediately after manipulation, patient reported 0/10 pain. With 6 weeks of additional treatment, the patient was able to return to pain-free  running \u2013A posterior tibialis lengthening exercise was added to the patient\u2019s home program after manipulation. While standing, the patient maintained knee extension and lower leg internal rotation to create pronation of the rear and midfoot, which in turn lengthened the posterior tibialis",
            "In patients with posterior tibialis tendinopathy, orthoses and therapeutic exercise may improve function of the involved foot(6) \u2013Based on an RCT with 36 participants \u2013Participants with stage I or II disease were randomized to one of the following (for 12 weeks) -Orthoses and stretching -Orthoses, stretching, and concentric progressive resistive exercise -Orthoses, stretching, and eccentric progressive resistive exercise \u2013Outcome measures included the Foot Function Index, 5-minute walk test, and recorded pain after the 5-minute  walk test \u2013Pain was significantly reduced in all intervention groups \u2013Foot Function Index scores improved in all intervention groups \u2013No comparisons between groups were reported due to significant differences in scores between groups at baseline . Problem Goal Intervention Expected Progression Home Program  Pain, tenderness, and swelling _ _ Faulty foot mechanicsMinimize pain, tenderness, and swelling _ _ Improve foot mechanicsPatient education for pain management _ Use of ice pack/heat pack as indicated and appropriate, independent exercise program, and avoidance of overuse/training errors _ _ Ankle/foot protection: Modify or discontinue activities that provoke pain _ _ Physical agents/ mechanical modalities _ Trial of low-intensity pulsed US for pain management may be implemented _ _ Prescription, application of devices and equipment _ Many patients will benefit from simple treatments, such as orthotics. Because correcting the PTT dysfunction by orthotics alone may just shift the alignment problem further up the leg to the knee, muscular strengthening and education for the patient must be completed in conjunction with the addition of orthotics(1)Education may help to prevent exacerbation of injury and reduce the risk of reinjuryPatient should be educated on proper use of heat and cold packs  Reduced ankle joint ROMRestore ankle ROM Stretching exercises _ Passive ankle stretching in all directions to restore normal, pain- free ROMProgress each unique patient as appropriate and indicatedHome program may include strategies such as a towel plantar- flexor stretch: Patient long sitting with towel around the plantar aspect of the forefoot. The patient pulls the ankle into dorsi-flexion, stretching the plantar flexors. The stretch should be held 30 seconds and repeated 5\u201310 times (throughout the day) Reduced balance(1) Improve balance Therapeutic strategies _ Implement therapeutic activities to address balance impairments as indicated (e.g., BAPS board)Progress each unique patient as appropriate and indicatedIncorporate balance activities into the home program as indicated and appropriate Reduced strength Improve muscle strength and prevent atrophyStrengthening exercises _ Begin with isometric ankle dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, inversion, and eversion exercises _ _ Progress to dynamic ankle exercises against resistance bands and heel raises against the patient\u2019s body weight(#)Further progression to manually resisted eccentric ankle motions, which may include single-leg heel raises against resistance and/or body weight(#)Strategies may include resisted ankle plantar flexion and inversion: Patient long sitting with resistance bands around the plantar aspect of the foot. The patient actively completes plantar-flexion against the resistance band. This exercise is completed for inversion by shifting the band so that it rests on the medial aspect of the foot and the patient actively completes inversion _ _ Aerobic conditioning with a stationary bike may be used  Restrictions in daily activities and/or sport _ _ Increased risk for reinjury or progression of injuryRestore prior functional capacity in daily activities and/or sports _ _ Reduce risk of reinjury or progression of injuryFunctional training _ May begin with walking on the ground with correct/improved alignment and then progress to treadmill walking. Jogging should begin on an elliptical machine to simulate jogging (without the impact force). This also aids in reinforcing correct ankle and knee alignmentProgress each unique patient as appropriate and indicatedA home exercise program may be provided to improve results ."
