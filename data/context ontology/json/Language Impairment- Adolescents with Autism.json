            "ASD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impairments in development of language, communication, and reciprocal interaction and the presence of repetitive and ritualistic behaviors.(1) Onset is before the age of 3 years.(2,60) The diagnostic label of ASD now includes several conditions that were previously considered separate disorders: autistic disorder, pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS),  early infantile autism, atypical autism, Kanner\u2019s autism, high-functioning  autism, childhood disintegrative disorder, and Asperger syndrome (AS).(60) According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5 ),all of the aforementioned conditions are referred to and diagnosed as ASD.(60) Diagnostic criteria for ASD per the DSM-5  are as follows:",
            "Criterion A: Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts, as manifested by the following, currently or by history: \u2013Deficits in social-emotional  reciprocity (e.g., failure to initiate social interactions; inappropriate responses to social situations)(60) \u2013Deficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction (e.g., poor eye contact; lack of facial expression)(60) \u2013Deficits in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships (e.g., difficulty making friends; no interest in one\u2019s peers)(60) \u2013For the diagnosis of ASD, these deficits must be pervasive and sustained(60) \u2013In addition to documenting the presence of the above mentioned deficits, the diagnosing clinician (a specially trained developmental physician or psychologist) must also specify current severity level of social communication impairments when diagnosing ASD.(60) Because the severity of behaviors in ASD is known to fluctuate over time, the severity label is used to refer only to current  severity(60)",
            "Criterion B: Restricted, repetitive patterns of behaviors, interests, or activities, as manifested by at least two of the following, currently or by history: \u2013Stereotyped or repetitive motor movements, use of objects, or speech(60) -An example of stereotyped speech is echolalia, described below(60) \u2013Insistence on sameness, inflexible adherence to routines, or ritualized patterns of verbal or nonverbal behavior (e.g., rigid thought patterns; wanting the same sequence of activities in each therapy session)(60)  \u2013Highly restricted, fixated interests that are abnormal in intensity or focus (e.g., a strong preoccupation with comic books to the exclusion of all other activities and interests)(60) \u2013Hyper-  or hyporeactivity to sensory input or unusual interest in sensory aspects of the environment (e.g., inability to tolerate loud noises; apparent indifference to pain or temperature)(60) \u2013In addition to documenting the presence of two or more of the above mentioned deficits, the diagnosing clinician must also specify current severity level of restrictive, repetitive behaviors when diagnosing ASD.(60) Because the severity of behaviors in ASD is known to fluctuate over time, the severity label is used to refer only to current  severity(60)",
            "Criterion C: Symptoms must be present in the early-developmental period (but might not fully manifest until social demands exceed limited capacities, or might be masked by learned strategies later in life)(60)",
            "Criterion D: Symptoms cause clinical significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of current functioning(60)",
            "Criterion E: These disturbances are not better explained by intellectual disability or global developmental delay(60) \u2013Intellectual disability often co-occurs  with ASD; in order for both diagnoses to be applicable, social functioning would be impaired more than would be expected given the individual\u2019s developmental level and cognitive functioning(60)",
            "The diagnosing clinician will also specify the following when diagnosing ASD: \u2013With or without accompanying intellectual impairment(60) \u2013With or without accompanying language impairment(60) \u2013Associated with another neurodevelopmental, mental, or behavioral disorder(60) \u2013With catatonia(60)",

Thedevelopmental trajectory for ASD is not universal.(85)Several studies have indicated that many individuals with ASD showa gradual improvement in symptoms between the ages of 6 and 10 years, with fluctuations in adolescence and adulthood,but an overall increase in adaptive skills and communication as they mature.(8,85)Other studies indicate that psychiatricdisorders (e.g., depression) and maladaptive behaviors worsen in adolescence and adulthood(9)"

            "ABA: ABA is based on the theory of operant conditioning and is designed to eliminate negative behaviors and increase positive ones. Operant conditioning principles include shaping (reinforcing increasingly accurate versions of desired responses), chaining (reinforcing individual responses in a sequence to form a complex behavior), and discrimination training (teaching the individual to perform a behavior when one antecedent is presented and not when another is presented). Therapy is usually provided in a one-to-one discrete trial format, and targets can include a variety of communicative functions, including preverbal communication, requesting desired items, social language (e.g., please, thank you), positive interactions with peers, answering why-questions,  and overall increased communication.(46) The use of ABA requires specific training. For more information, see research and guidelines by Lovaas(47)",

            "Functional communication training (FCT): The method of FCT is to determine the motivation for, or purpose of, a challenging behavior and then teach a more appropriate replacement behavior. This approach is often used with individuals with ASD who exhibit challenging behaviors (e.g., tantrums, aggression, self-injury). Most of the research on FCT is limited to single-subject  studies, but there is preliminary evidence that FCT is effective in eliminating negative behaviors and generalization of new language skills to other people and environments(49)",

The aim is to facilitate the independence of children and adolescents with ASD by providing predictable routines and visual supports -In a meta-analysis  of 13 clinical studies, researchers assessed the clinical effectiveness of TEACCH. Effects of TEACCH on perceptual, motor, cognitive and verbal skills were small. Effects on daily living skills, communication and motor functioning were negligible. The greatest gains were in improving social and maladaptive behaviors. Researchers caution that results should be considered exploratory given the small base of studies(81)",

            "Social skills interventions: Social skills interventions include social skills training, the use of social stories, and cognitive behavioral training(50)  \u2013Social skills training(50) -In social skills training, individuals are taught discrete social skills, such as perspective taking, conversational skills, problem solving, emotional awareness, and regulation -Methods used include coaching, modeling, role plays, social scripts, virtual reality (e.g., navigating a virtual playground scene),(51) feedback, and written cueing in individual or group therapy -Authors of a systematic review of group-based  social skills interventions (GSSIs) for adolescents with high-functioning ASD examined effectiveness of a variety of GSSIs in improving social skills of adolescents with ASD. Researchers report that intervention characteristics (e.g. teaching strategies, targeted skills) varied considerably. Results consistently showed high parent and child satisfaction with interventions; however, overall results were generally inconclusive. Authors suggest that future research should more rigorously evaluate methodology(82) -In a study conducted in Canada of adolescents with ASD (N = 46), researchers examined the effectiveness of a 12-week social skills training program on social skills and problem behaviors. Participants were divided into groups of 7\u20138 that met weekly for 1.5 hours each session.(52) The format of the group sessions included a standard sequence of activities: check-in,  review of the previous week's social skill, introduction of the new skills, role play, snack break, activity (group game such as charades), and closing. Pre- and posttest measures included three parent questionnaires, one measuring social competence, and two measuring aberrant behaviors. Social skills addressed included awareness and expression of feelings, making eye contact, politeness, starting a conversation, listening to others, dining etiquette, and dating. Significant gains were seen on all posttreatment measures and effect sizes ranged from 0.34 to 0.72 -In a study conducted in the United States, including five high school students with intellectual disability and ASD, researchers used a communication book in combination with opportunities to interact with general education peers to promote social skills(53) -The communication books included conversational topics and questions for the students with ASD to use as a reference during conversations with their general education peers(53) -Two of the participants were able to read the questions aloud to conversational partners and then verbally expand on the topics(53) -Two other participants were nonverbal, but used gesture and pointing to have their peers read the questions and initiate conversation(53) -The fifth participant did not read, but instead verbally interacted with communication partners who could read the questions from the communication book(53) -After the intervention, all five participants indicated verbally or nonverbally that they had met their social goals of having more friends(53) -In a study conducted in the United States with 28 participants with ASD aged 10\u201316years  enrolled in a social skills training program, researchers studied two groups of children: one aged 10\u201313  years and one group of adolescents aged 13\u201316  years.(72) In one of the intervention groups of 10\u201313  year olds, there were two typically developing peers that served as social role models. Intervention involved 22 weekly sessions with the following activities: structured introduction time, a didactic lesson with social topics (e.g., friendships, conversations), an unstructured playground time, an unstructured game playing time (e.g., Uno, Jenga, Tinker Toys), and a structured joke-telling  time. After each session, participants were given a short homework assignment. During the intervention sessions, parents and some siblings attended educational/support groups. At the conclusion of the study, researchers used behavioral coding to document changes resulting from the social skills training program. Researchers reported the following positive findings: responding vocalizations increased and \u201cother\u201d (nondirected) vocalizations decreased; participants spent more time with the peer group and less time interacting with the group leader; and participants engaged more in dyadic interactions with peers by the end of the intervention.(72) One finding that was unexpected was that the number of initiating vocalizations decreased over time; however, researchers reported that this might have been a result of longer/ more frequent conversations among group members, resulting in less of a need to initiate new conversations(72) -In a study conducted in the United States with 45 children and adolescents aged 8\u201318  years with ASD or disruptive behavior disorder (DBD), participants were divided into an experimental group (n = 24) and control group (n = 21).(73) The children and adolescents in the experimental group participated in 8 weeks of social skills group therapy in an outpatient setting.(73) Each session lasted for 1 hour and included a maximum of eight participants; groups were formed according to age (8\u201311  and 12\u201318).(73) The groups were led by a multidisciplinary team including licensed clinical  psychologists, postdoctoral psychology fellows, pre-doctoral  psychology interns, and doctoral students enrolled in an ABA program.(73)Group sessions were based on the SCORE (Social Skills for Cooperative Groups) manual-based curriculum and consisted of an unstructured social time with snacks and games (e.g., cards, board games), and a didactic lesson in which skills were reviewed, taught, and practiced in role-playing  sessions. Students were given homework assignments each week. Researchers assessed social skills of both experimental and control groups before and after the intervention period using the Social Skills Improvement System (SSIS) Rating Scales. At the conclusion of therapy, researchers found that the scores on the Social Skills Scale of the SSIS improved for the experimental group (not significantly), but remained the same for the control group. The scores on the Problem Behavior Scale of the SISS remained the same for both groups(73) -In a study conducted in the United States with six high school students with ASD, researchers used a communication book intervention program to increase social conversational interactions.(74) During the intervention sessions, a peer trainer (a 17-year-old  male with a positive rapport with each of the participants who was receiving special education services because of a learning disability) taught the participants to use a communication book to initiate social interactions.(74) In each communication book, there were 10 to 20 pages that were organized by topics and customized for individual preferences. The length of intervention was different for each participant based on individual needs and speed with which training benchmarks were achieved, but ranged from 7 to 37 sessions.(74) At both the start and the conclusion of the study, researchers performed analysis of conversational interactions with typically developing peers and social validation measures. Prior to having the participants engage in conversation with a peer postintervention, each peer attended a conversational partner orientation session to learn about the use of the communication book. At the conclusion of the study, researchers found that this intervention was effective in increasing the social interactions of the members of the study group with their nondisabled peers.(74) Additionally, participants, peers, and teachers reported high levels of social acceptability of the books in both academic and lunch room settings(74) -In a study conducted in the United States with four adolescents (ages 13\u201316  years) with ASD and moderate to profound intellectual disability, researchers examined the effect of reciprocal imitation training (RIT) on social behaviors.(75) RIT is a naturalistic behavioral intervention that was developed for young children with autism and teaches children to use imitation to increase appropriate behaviors in social situations. Participants received 10 weeks of intervention in one-on-one sessions. In each session, the teacher used RIT principles (contingent imitation, linguistic mapping, following the student\u2019s lead, physical prompting, and contingent reinforcement) to teach imitation skills. The teacher demonstrated actions for the student to imitate and provided verbal praise once imitation was accurately achieved.(75) At the conclusion of therapy, the researchers documented the following: all students improved in spontaneous object imitation (two of the students demonstrated imitation generalization to novel, functional tasks), improvements were found in 2/4 subjects in joint engagement during treatment sessions, self-stimulatory  behavior was reduced in both participants who exhibited it on baseline measures, and na\u00efve observers rated the students significantly better with respect to social behavior in a 2-minute observation(75) -In a study conducted in the United States with seven high school students (ages 14\u201316)  with ASD, researchers attempted to increase social interaction by having each participant start or join a club with typically developing peers based on the participant\u2019s own personal interests/preferences.(76) The parameters of social interaction used as outcome measures were the following: the percent of time engaged with typical peers, the frequency of initiations made to typical peers, and social validation measures made by self-report.(76) At the conclusion of the intervention period (which varied for each participant based on the specific club), all participants demonstrated improvement in the above mentioned parameters of social interaction. Additionally, both the participant group and the typically developing peers involved in the study reported that the structured club activities were enjoyable(76) -In a pilot study conducted in the United States, researchers assessed the acceptability and feasibility of an iPad app, SpeechPrompts , for improving prosody in the speech of 40 children (from preschool to high school age) with ASD. The app provides visual feedback for users regarding the prosodic elements of their speech (e.g., stress, volume, intonation). The SLPs involved in the study reported that because of the familiarity of the iPad to the students, the app was motivating and easily incorporated into therapy sessions. Additionally, data from the pilot study indicated that there were improvements in prosodic deficits associated with use of the app. Further research was recommended to determine effectiveness of the app for improving prosodic functioning(89)  \u2013Social stories -Social stories are narratives written by parents, teachers, or clinicians to help individuals with ASD understand certain social situations and to increase social initiations. It is hypothesized that the individual will increase social understanding by repeatedly rereading such narratives, which are often accompanied by photographs or pictures. In this way, the behaviors in specific social situations become familiar and predictable. Research on social stories has indicated more positive results in controlled situations than in natural situations (e.g., school cafeteria), and more research is needed to determine the effectiveness of social stories(54)",
            "Self-operating  auditory prompting systems \u2013Self-operating  auditory prompting systems are prerecorded antecedent cues that increase the probability of a desired outcome.(55) These systems can be either step-by-step  prerecorded instructions intended to guide an individual to complete a task or prerecorded prompts to encourage the individual to stay on task(55) \u2013In a study conducted in the United States that included two 17-year-old  boys with ASD and moderate intellectual disability, a self-operated  auditory prompting system was utilized to increase on-task  behavior in an employment-based education training program(55) -Prior to starting at an actual worksite, the boys were trained to use a self-operated  auditory prompting system in the classroom(55) -Preferred music and inserted self-evaluation prompts on a variable schedule (mean of every 30 seconds) were recorded onto a tape recorder and the boys used a recorder and headphones to listen(55) -Examples of self-evaluation  prompts were: \u201cAre you working?,\u201d \u201cKeep working,\u201d and \u201cAre you done with that area?\u201d(55) -The boys were trained on how to use the on-off button in the classroom and demonstrated mastery of the skill prior to entering the worksites(55) -Based on personal interests and rating scales, both boys were placed at restaurant worksites for the study(55) -At the start of each shift, they were assigned a table to clean by their special education teacher; the task involved donning special gloves and cleaning the table, booth, and chairs, as well as placing a menu on the table; at one restaurant, the boys were also required to place a table setting on the table with the menu(55) -An ABAB design was used in the study and took place over 29 sessions(55) -For the initial baseline (sessions 1\u20138),  the students were given instructions on their tasks, and restaurant staff and/or teachers were able to prompt as necessary to remain on task(55) -For the first intervention (sessions 9\u201314),  the students were given a standard self-operated prompting systems (the same recordings for both boys). and restaurant staff and/or teachers were able to prompt as necessary to remain on task(55) -The second baseline (sessions 15\u201322)  involved continuing their work without their prompting systems with restaurant staff and/or teachers able to prompt as necessary to remain on task(55) -Finally, for the second intervention (sessions 23\u201329),  the prompting systems were reinitiated, but this time they were individualized for each participant based on an analysis of the prompts that seemed to be most helpful for each boy, and restaurant staff and/or teachers were able to prompt as necessary to remain on task(55) -In the initial baseline, the first subject exhibited on-task  behavior less than 45% (mean of 29%) of the time, requiring prompts from support staff 13\u201338%  of the time(55) -Under the first intervention condition, on-task behavior increased to a range of 70\u201391%  (mean of 81%) and support staff prompting dropped to 2%(55) -With the second baseline (removal of the auditory prompting system), on-task  behavior dropped to 61\u201387%  (mean of 70%) with support staff prompting at up to 22%(55) -Finally, with the second intervention condition, on-task  behavior ranged from 75\u2013100% (mean of 90%) with prompts from support staff dropping to 0%(55) -In the initial baseline, the second subject exhibited on-task  behavior 32\u201350%  (mean of 42%) of the time, requiring prompts from support staff a mean of 65% of the time(55) -Under the first intervention condition, on-task behavior increased to a mean of 69% and support staff prompting dropped to 30%(55)  -With the second baseline (removal of the auditory prompting system), on-task  behavior dropped to a mean of 51% with support staff prompting required up to 22% of the time(55) -Finally, with the second intervention condition, on-task  behavior ranged from 25\u201381% (mean of 59%) with prompts from support staff dropping to range of 1\u201317%  with a mean of 10%(55) -Although the self-operated  auditory prompting system was more effective for the first subject, both subjects benefited from tailored self-operated auditory prompting systems in terms of increased on-task  behaviors and decreased outside staff prompting needed(55)",
            "Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) \u2013The focus of CBT when used for adolescents with ASD is to teach the individual to develop social thinking and social expectations. Four steps for developing social thinking are presented here in a simplified format.(17) An example of CBT to enhance social skills can be found in Winner (2003):(56) -Step 1: The individual with ASD is taught to think about what he or she knows about the person with whom he or she would like to communicate. The individual is also taught to infer things about the person: what school they go to, where they live, what people they know -Step 2: The individual with ASD is taught to establish a physical presence by approaching in a relaxed and natural manner -Step 3: The individual is taught to \"think with your eyes\" to try to determine what his or her communicative partner is thinking or feeling -Step 4: The individual is taught to use language to relate to others (e.g., to look and seem interested in the topic of conversation) -CBT has also shown to be effective in reducing anxiety in individuals with ASD.(84) Researchers in the United States examined the effectiveness of one CBT program on 24 adolescents (ages 13\u201318)  with high-functioning  ASD. Significant reductions in anxiety were noted following the 14-session  program. Low rates of anxiety were maintained at a 3 month follow-up(83)",

They received pre- and posttest assessments of occupational performance, and the devices were examined for frequency of use. At the end of 8 weeks, all participants showed improved occupational performance and most participants were able to use the device software as trained. All participants reported that use of the devices increased their independence in performing daily functional activities \u2013Authors of a literature review published in 2015 that included 16 studies reported that visual activity schedules were effective for individuals with ASD in reducing problem behaviors, improving latency from task direction to task completion, and increasing appropriate and independent transitions between activities. Authors noted that their findings substantiated previous research supporting the use of visual activity schedules for individuals with ASD(87)",
