            "Spinal traction is the application of tensile forces to the long axis of the spine.(1) Lumbar traction is a treatment for low back pain (LBP) and symptoms associated with mechanical back pathology, such as disc herniation, radiculopathy, and muscle spasm. Traction may be applied mechanically or manually. Mechanical traction generally makes use of a motorized pulley system and a harness attached to the patient\u2019s torso to apply the desired force or weight. The goal is to unload the disc space and muscles in the lumbar spine"

            "Research on alternative forms of traction \u2013In an RCT conducted in Poland, investigators found that significantly better analgesic effects were obtained in a group of patients with chronic LBP treated with Saunders lumbar traction than in a control group(5) -Saunders lumbar traction is a pneumatic traction device marketed for home use -The study included 140 patients who were randomly assigned to receive axial Saunders traction applied to the lumbar part of the vertebral column or pharmacological treatment (control) -Both groups showed reduced pain and improved function, but the results were significantly better in the traction group \u2013Lumbar extension traction (in which a posterior padded belt is placed under the patient\u2019s lower back) in addition to stretching exercises and infrared radiation has been reported to improve spine sagittal alignment and decrease pain and disability in patients with chronic mechanical LBP(3) -Based on an RCT conducted in Egypt with 80 patients with chronic mechanical LBP and definite hypolordosis randomly assigned to a group receiving stretching exercises and infrared radiation or a group receiving lumbar extension traction as well as stretching exercises and infrared radiation. Treatment was 3 times a week for 10 weeks -The main outcome variable was the lumbar lordotic curve, measured via X-ray  before and after intervention -Secondary outcome measures included pain (V AS) and disability (Oswestry Low Back Disability Questionnaire) -There was a significant difference between the groups with respect to lumbar lordotic curve, thoracic kyphosis, sacral slope, and C7 plumb line distance -Pain and disability decreased in both groups \u2013Other variations of lumbar traction include auto-traction, \u201cspinal decompression,\u201d and inversion(1) -Auto-traction  uses a patient\u2019s own body weight and muscle strength to provide distractive forces -However, activation of paraspinal musculature when performing auto-traction  tends to preclude generation of effective distraction force(1) -Spinal decompression has been promoted as a novel approach, although the distinction between decompression and traction is reportedly based largely on technicalities related to U.S. FDA approval and marketing(1) -Inversion devices allow gravity-assisted  traction. The patient secures the pelvis and lower extremities into a frame and then the body position is inverted, allowing the upper trunk weight to distract the spine(1) -Increases in lumbar intervertebral space immediately following inversion have been documented(1) -Adverse effects of the inverted position include increased intraocular pressure, alterations in blood pressure, and anxiety while inverted -Not recommended for patients with a history of dizziness, vertigo, or hypertension \u2013Supine mid-abdominal  traction is another form of traction that allows a load to be applied to the anterior abdomen while the patient is supine with knees flexed(10) \u2013Low force traction (10% body weight) was found to be just as effective as high force (50% body weight) in reducing radicular pain and functional impairment and improving well-being(18) -Based on an RCT conducted in France involving 17 subjects with acute lumbar sciatica secondary to disc herniation -Patients received 10 treatments in 2 weeks -Benefits were maintained after 2 weeks follow-up",
