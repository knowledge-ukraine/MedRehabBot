            "A method of gait training using assistive technology that makes use of automated devices to exert mechanical forces to move the body",
            "Robotic-assisted  gait training was developed to overcome disadvantages inherent in body-weight-supported  treadmill training (BWSTT) used for restoration of gait following stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI), spinal cord injury (SCI), and other neurological conditions(1) \u2013Without robotic assistance, two or three therapists are required to assist a patient\u2019s gait during treadmill training -One therapist is required to manually place each affected leg and another therapist assists lateral weight shifting and upright trunk positioning -The correct assistance of leg movements during the training is crucial. The most advantageous input to the spinal cord is attained only if the legs are moved in as normal of a gait pattern as possible -As therapists start to experience fatigue, the patient\u2019s gait can become asymmetrical and the benefit of repetitive practice decreases",
            "Robotic-assisted  gait trainers are mechanized devices that enable the repetitive practice of physiological gait patterns without relying on therapists. Other advantages include: \u2013training can start earlier after trauma or neurological insult because the robotic devices generate more power than a human being \u2013the duration of the training can be longer, allowing more opportunity for repetitive practice \u2013training is less costly, with only one therapist required",
            "Robotic-assisted  gait training involves the use of an exoskeleton device to improve motor coordination(16) \u2013Exoskeletons utilize devices called actuators that assist in moving the patients\u2019 legs during the gait cycle by utilizing preprogrammed gait cycles \u2013Nearly all functional exoskeletons require an external support system to ensure balance of the individual",
            "Feedback about the quality of movement and extent of muscle activity is important for gait training. These are difficult for patients to assess themselves, especially if sensory, proprioceptive, or cognitive impairments are present \u2013Therapists have less contact with patients during robotic-assisted  gait training compared to manually assisted partial BWSTT. Therefore, they are less able to assess the patients\u2019 involvement -Muscle strength, muscle tone, and ROM of the lower limb might be measured by potentiometers and force transducers in some robotic devices -Online feedback about joint movement and force production can be provided ",
            "Commercially available robotic gait machines include the Gait Trainer, (GT) with variations referred to as GT I, GT II, and MGT (for Mechanized Gait Trainer) (Reha-Stim,  Berlin, Germany), which control endpoint trajectories; the Lokomat (Hocoma Medical Engineering Inc., Zurich, Switzerland), the AutoAmbulator (Encompass Health, Birmingham, Alabama, United States), and the Walkbot (P&S Mechanics Co., Ltd., Seoul, South Korea),which use robotic exoskeletons and a treadmill; and the LOPES (Lower-extremity  Powered ExoSkeleton, Laboratory Biomechanical Engineering, University of Twente, Enschede, the Netherlands), which is designed specifically for research(1,11)",
