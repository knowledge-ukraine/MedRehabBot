            "Functional deficits resulting from SF are associated with pain/tenderness, reduced forefoot ROM, asymmetric weight-bearing, and gait disturbances",
            "Treatment for the stress/fatigue SF is typically nonoperative and involves pain management, activity modification, and avoidance of forefoot dorsiflexion with a removable walker boot or shoe modification and orthotic insole recessed under the sesamoid. Full recovery can be prolonged(4)",
            "Treatment for the nondisplaced acute SF is also usually nonoperative and involves protection, rest, ice, compression, and elevation (PRICE) and immobilization with a removable walker boot or a short-leg  hallux spica cast for 4 to 6 weeks, followed by rehabilitation.(7) During this time, the toe is kept in plantarflexion(4)",

Activity and weight- bearing restrictions. Protective footwear, orthoses, and insoles. Shoe modificationsAllow 2\u20133 weeks for resolution of inflammation and swelling _ _ Progressive weight- bearing, as ordered by physicianUse PRICE approach Loss of ROM and strength related to limb immobilization, including atrophy and stiffnessNormalize ROM, strength, and function for return to normal ADLsTherapeutic modalities _ Cross-training exercises with uninvolved extremities to maintain flexibility, strength, and endurance _ _ When FWB: exercises to restore ROM/ strength of foot and great toe. Resistance exercises for foot and great toe strengthening (especially hallux plantar flexion)Increase intensity and duration of cross- training, as appropriate _ _ Gradually progress foot and great toe exercises; 3\u20135x per week for 4\u20138 weeks.
