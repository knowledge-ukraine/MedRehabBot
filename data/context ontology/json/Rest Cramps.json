            "Nocturnal leg cramps (NLCs) are suddenly occurring, episodic, persistently painful, involuntary contractions of the calfor foot muscles at night. Recurrent NLCs cause fatigue and muscle pain that reduce functional ability in ADLs(7,8) \u2013Some authors include the hamstring muscles in NLCs. However, one diagnostic characteristic of NLCs is they are seldom located in the thigh(7)",
            "Up to 33% of adults over 50 years of age(7)and approximately 25% of the general population experience NLCs(8)",
            "By definition NLCs occur at nighttime, although patients may also experience \u201crest cramps\u201d during the day(3)",
            "NLCs are often hard to distinguish from restless leg syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb movement disorder(7) -Authors of a 2017 systematic review examined the differences between NLCs, RLS and periodic limb movement disorder in adults over 50. It was based on eight RCTs and ten observational studies followed by a Delphi study. The authors came up with the following distinguishing characteristics for each diagnosis:(35)NLCs \u2013 Intense pain,period of seconds to a maximum of 10 minutes,located inposterior calf or foot,subsequent pain,sleep disruptionand distress -RLS \u2013Irritating,  burning, crawling sensations, in episodes, an urge to move, reduction of symptoms by activity, no pain -Periodic limb movement disorder \u2013No pain, repeating, jerking movements, duration 20\u201330  seconds",
            "In the past, quinine was recommended to treat NLCs but is now discouraged because of serious adverse effects. Most recommendations indicate that stretching before bedtime may be beneficial, but more research needs to be done(9)"

These agents should be considered only when cramps are very disabling, no other medications relieve symptoms, and there is careful monitoring of side effects. Patients need to be informed of the potential serious side effects Thirty-eight  cases of serious side effects associated with the use of quinine to treat NLCs were reported between April 2005 and October 2008 in the United States, which prompted the manufacturer to develop a risk management plan aimed at educating healthcare professionals and patients(1)  If patient has diagnosis of lumbar spinal stenosis and NLCs, he or she may be prescribed botulinum toxin (BTX) Results of an RCT indicated that BTX was more effective than gabapentin plus conservative treatments for NLCs in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis(10) Magnesium supplements are marketed for the prophylaxis of cramps.
