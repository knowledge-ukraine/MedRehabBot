Researchers investigated the utility of HRM for pharyngealdysphagia due to limitations associated with frequent administration of videofluoroscopic swallow studies (VFSSs).Although a VFSS is unparalleled for its ability to identify pharyngeal phase swallowing impairments, since it exposespatients to radiation it cannot be used for frequent reassessments of swallowing ability over time. Researchers wereable to identify 12 different swallowing impairments through analysis of the HRM data; however, those types ofimpairments involving abnormalities of pressure (e.g., reduced anterior hyoid excursion, pharyngeal residue, impairedpharyngoesophageal segment opening) were identified with a higher degree of accuracy than those without clear pressurepatterns (e.g., reduce epiglottic retroflexion, delayed pharyngeal swallow initiation).(28) The same group of researchersinvestigated the use of a novel automated HRM program for evaluating pharyngeal swallow impairment and foundhigh interrater reliability within and across groups of expert users, novice users, and SLPs.(29) Novice users (a group ofundergraduate research assistants) and SLPs were given a short training sessions prior to evaluating 30 swallow studieswith the automated HRM program. The automated program produced objective, numerical data, which likely resulted inthe fast and reliable interpretation of data by new users(29)"

Additionally, mano-videoendoscopy  evaluations are performed without radiation, which is beneficial for repeat evaluations of swallow function(31,32) -The tip of the manometric catheter is lubricated and passed transnasally by a trained technician(13) -The tip of the catheter is fed into the hypopharynx and through the UES(13) \u2013Manometric evaluation of oropharyngeal swallowing likely is unfamiliar to many SLPs -In the past, oropharyngeal manometry failed to become a widely used clinical tool because SLPs were not trained to perform transnasal procedures, the use of a 4.6 mm catheter for the procedure required nasal anesthetic (possibly anesthetizing the oropharynx), and the use of this type of large-bore  catheter altered temporal aspects of swallowing physiology(3,7) -In recent years, integration of manometry as a diagnostic tool for oropharyngeal dysphagia has become more common because SLPs are better trained in transnasal procedures (e.g., FEES), a much smaller (2.1 mm) catheter is available that does not require nasal anesthetic, and the smaller nasopharyngeal catheter does not appear to alter baseline swallowing function in any substantial way(3,13) -In a study conducted in the United States involving 20 healthy older adults (mean age 78.9 years), researchers examined swallowing ability by FEES with various viscosities of boluses with and without a 2.1-mm  manometric catheter present(13) -The researchers scored 545 swallows based on the Penetration-Aspiration  Scale (PAS). The presence of the manometric catheter did not increase instances of penetration or aspiration in these healthy adults(13) \u2013Lack of normative data for normal swallowing and dysphagic populations is a considerable obstacle to widespread use of manometry for oropharyngeal dysphagia assessment(5,13) -Although manometry can be used to quantify pressures generated in the pharynx and pharyngeal musculature, manometry alone cannot identify the specific anatomical structures (i.e., tongue, palate, larynx, pharynx) generating specific pressures at any given moment during the examination(20)",
