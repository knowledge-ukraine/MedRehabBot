The location of this incision depends on where the specific problem in the brain is located(1)-Craniotomy can be performed while the patient is under general anesthesia or while the patient is awake through use oflocal anesthetic(8)\u2013Next, the surgeon creates a hole in the skull and removes a portion of the skull (bone flap)(1)-When possible, the surgeon makes another smaller hole and inserts a tube with a light and camera on the end (anendoscope). The surgery can then be completed with tools placed through the endoscope; MRI or CT scan can be usedto guide the surgery\u2013During a craniotomy, the surgeon might need to:-clip off an aneurysm to prevent blood flow(1)-remove a tumor or a piece of tumor for a biopsy(1)-remove abnormal brain tissue(1)-drain blood or an infection(1)-implant a device (e.g., extraventricular drain, stimulator electrodes)(29,30)\u2013After surgery, the bone flap usually is replaced using small metal plates, sutures, or wires(1)\u2013When the bone flap is not replaced, the procedure is called a craniectomy(1,2,3,43)-The bone flap is sometimes not replaced if the surgery involves a tumor or an infection or if there is significant swellingin the brain(1)-A hemicraniectomy is when part or all of one half of the skull is excised, which can improve outcomes for patients withlarge middle cerebral artery strokes(9)-A decompressive craniectomy is a procedure often performed on patients with diffuse brain swelling after hemorrhageor trauma in order to reduce intracranial pressure (ICP)(2,3,36)-A cranioplasty is the surgical repair of the skull and can be performed at some point after a craniectomy to replace thebone flap and restore the structural integrity of the skull(36)"

The patient had postoperative hemorrhages and hydrocephalus. Her prognosis was deemed poor. However, coordinated care and an excellent support system from her family over a 14-month  period allowed the patient to return to her home, where she could stand and ambulate with assistance and perform most ADLS with standby or set-up assistance(38) \u2013ICU rehabilitation: The patient was in the ICU for 6 weeks during which she received 19 occupational therapy visits and 12 physical therapy visits. The occupational therapy sessions lasted 30 to 45 minutes -Multimodal sensory stimulation (MSS) and early mobility were initial treatments. MSS can promote brain reorganization by targeting the reticular activating system (RAS).In previous research, MSS along with early mobility hasbeen shown to assist with eliciting a state of arousal from a comatose state, transition to an inpatient rehabilitation unit, and ultimately improve prognosis -MSS therapy included interventions such as wiping a cold washcloth along the patient\u2019s face, neck, and wrist or clapping loudly in the patient\u2019s ears -Early mobility treatments included bed mobility and ADL retraining. Activities included grasping and releasing cones and sponges, muscle tapping/brushing, bilateral pectoral myofascial release, and joint compression to increase proprioceptive output \u2013Inpatient rehabilitation unit: The patient then went to an inpatient rehabilitation unit for 10 weeks, where she received 54 occupational therapy visits and 51 physical therapy visits.Therapy took place3 hours a day, 5\u20137 days a week -Initially occupational therapy emphasized control, with upright sitting, upper extremity ROM, and gaze stabilization exercises. Treatments progressed to bed mobility, standing transfers from bed to a chair, propelling a wheelchair with her legs, and more wheelchair mobility to allow patient to begin to perform lower body dressing \u2013Outpatient rehabilitation:The patient received 117 occupational therapy visits and 115 physical therapy visits over 41 weeks. Occupational therapytook place 3 times a week for 45 to 60 minutes per session -Outpatient rehabilitationtreatment initially focused on care-giver  education for home exercise programs, core stability activities while supine and sitting.
