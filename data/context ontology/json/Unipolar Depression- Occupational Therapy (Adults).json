            "Depression is a common psychological condition, affecting up to 30% of primary care patients.(1) Depression is a primary mood disorder.(3) Diagnosis of depression is made when the symptoms (e.g., difficulty with concentration, fatigue, feelings of guilt or helplessness, loss of interest in once-pleasurable  activities, persistent sadness or anxiety, suicidal ideation or attempts) are present every day during a 2-week period and contribute to a change from prior level of functioning.(4)",
            "There are four major classifications of depression/depressive disorders(1) \u2013Adjustment disorder with depressed mood(1) -Depression occurring in reaction to some identifiable stress or difficult life situation (e.g., divorce, loss of job, death of a loved one) -Onset of this type of depression occurs within 3 months of the incident or event; the depression causes significant decline in social and/or occupational functioning \u2013Depressive disorders -Major depressive disorder (MDD)(1) -Involves at least one episode of serious mood depression that occurs at any time of life(1) -Symptoms will vary significantly across patients; however, common complaints include loss of interest and/or pleasure (anhedonia), withdrawal from activities, and feelings of guilt(1,3) -Subcategories include MDD with atypical features; major depression with seasonal onset (seasonal affective disorder [SAD]); and major depression with postpartum onset (usually occurs within 2 weeks to 6 months postpartum)(1) -Dysthymia(1) -Chronic depressive disturbance -Symptoms include sadness, loss of interest in and withdrawal from activities over a period of 2 or more years with a relatively persistent course -Symptoms are milder but longer lasting than in MDD(1) -Premenstrual dysphoric disorder(1) -Depressive symptoms occur during the late luteal phase (last 2 weeks) of the patient\u2019s menstrual cycle \u2013Bipolar disorder -Depressive disorder that consists of episodic mood shifts between mania, major depression, hypomania, and mixed mood states(1) -Bipolar I \u2013 both depressive and manic episodes  -Bipolar II \u2013 depressive and hypomanic episodes, but without mania -Bipolar III \u2013 person experiences mania when treated with antidepressants -High rate of substance abuse comorbidity(1) -Mania(1) -Mania is characterized by an episode of mood state involving elation, hyperactivity, over-involvement  in activities, increased irritability, flight of ideas, easy distractibility, and minimal sleep(1) -Spring and summer are the peak periods of mania(1) -Manic episodes typically are shorter than depressive episodes(1) -The patient with bipolar disorder often has difficulty maintaining relationships due to the volatility of his or her mood(1) -Patients with four or more discrete episodes of mood disturbance in 1 year are referred to as \u201crapid cyclers\u201d(1) -Cyclothymic disorders(1) -Chronic mood disturbances with episodes of depression and hypomania(1) -Symptoms last at least 2 years and are milder than those occurring in depressive and manic episodes(1) -Symptoms may escalate to full manic and depressive episodes(1) \u2013Depressive disorders secondary to illness and drugs(1) -Any type of illness, ranging from mild to severe, can cause significant depression -Drug-induced  depression has been documented with use of antihypertensive medications, corticosteroids, and oral contraceptives, as well as alcohol, sedatives, opiates, and psychedelic drugs"

        "treatment summary": [
            "The following are occupational therapy practice guidelines for adults with serious mental illness developed by the American Occupational Therapy Association: \u2013General recommendations about working with adults with serious mental illness: -It is possible for persons with serious mental illness to manage their symptoms and lead healthy, meaningful lives. Part of an occupational therapy plan of care should be identifying specific areas of training and education that are necessary for the patient to succeed in the desired areas of occupation(35) -Occupational therapy needs to address both primary and secondary prevention of mental illness. Primary prevention methods include education on various topics to prevent unhealthy conditions (e.g., increased physical activity, smoking cessation, weight management). Secondary prevention focuses on the impact of depression on persons\u2019 function and QOL. Both are key to the resumptomion of occupational participation in persons with depression(35) -Occupational therapy should take a client-centered  approach, accounting for the person\u2019s own life goals(35) -Occupational therapy interventions should focus on building new skills, enhancing existing skills, and modifying environments both at home and work to increase participation. OTs need to considerpersons\u2019 individual strengths, routines, and existing emotional regulation strategies(35)",
            "Recommendations based on evidence from studies in patients with serious mental illness (all types of mental disorders were included in these studies, including depression)(35) \u2013There is strong evidence that occupation-based  interventions can increase social and occupational participation(35) -Occupational therapy intervention may increase employment rates, help patients find jobs quicker and keep them longer, and improve QOL \u2013There is strong evidence that psychoeducational interventions can improve ADL and IADL performance(35) \u2013There is mixed evidence for skill training interventions(35) \u2013There is strong evidence for cognition-based  interventions combined with social interaction and/or skill training to improve social participation and QOL(35) \u2013There is insufficient evidence for technology-supported  interventions to improve IADL performance(35) ",
            "Therapy might focus on improving medication/time management, ADLs/IADLs, community mobility and/or reentry, reestablishing daily routines, social integration, functional behavior training, and restoring motor and/or cognitive functioning(4) \u2013Occupational therapy programs for patients with depression should be tailored to the needs, goals, prior level of function, coping strategies, and motivational factors of the patient(20)",
            "Occupational therapy goals for patients with depression should be small and achievable, changing frequently to reflect the patient\u2019s current needs and abilities; if the goals are too difficult to achieve in a reasonable amount of time, the patient may give up, feeling that his or her belief that he or she is incompetent or worthless is accurate(7,11)",
            "Return to work/work-related  occupational therapy programs \u2013In an RCT conducted in the Netherlands, 62 adults with depression and frequent absenteeism from work (mean of 242 days missed) were randomized into two groups: treatment as usual (TAU) and TAU + occupational therapy(21) -The TAU group was treated according to the American Psychiatric Association guidelines in an outpatient treatment program; patients were prescribed medicines appropriate for their specific diagnosis and medical history and were seen by psychiatric residents for psychotherapy 2\u20133 times per week -The TAU + occupational therapy group received the same psychiatric treatment as well as occupational therapy sessions (4 once-weekly occupational therapy diagnostic sessions followed by 24 weekly 2-hour  group sessions and 12 individual sessions; also included a 20-week  follow-up  phase during which time the subjects were seen for 3 individual sessions) -Occupational therapy included preparation for work reintegration, contacting the subject\u2019s place of work, initiating workforce reentry when appropriate, analyses of the relationship between work and depression, discussions about work-related  problems, and support as the subject returned to work -Conclusions of the study -Adding occupational therapy to the TAU protocol did not accelerate recovery from depression; however, the addition of occupational therapy did accelerate return to work -The subjects in the TAU + occupational therapy group who returned to work sooner did not report increased work stress -Additionally, fewer patients in the TAU + occupational therapy group required hospital admission for intensive treatments; these numbers trended toward significance but did not reach a statistically significant level -The TAU + occupational therapy intervention was also found to be more cost-effective  than the TAU intervention; however, to be more cost-effective,  an hour of the subject\u2019s work would need to be valued at ~$10 \u2013In an RCT conducted in the Netherlands by the same group of investigators, designed to assess the effectiveness of adjuvant occupational therapy (as described above) in a population of persons who were highly impaired due to major depression, the authors found that the addition of occupational therapy did not improve work participation, but did improve long-term  depression recovery and long-term  return to work(37)",
            "Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and mindfulness-based  meditation(4) \u2013An OT can be trained and qualified to use CBT to aid in the rehabilitation of patients with depression(4) -In general, the principle that guides CBT is that a person\u2019s thoughts and beliefs regarding a particular situation change the way in which that person acts in the situation(17,18) -When a person expects failure or difficulty, failure or difficulty is more likely; when the person expects to succeed in a situation or activity, success is more likely(17) -CBT aims to help patients identify situations that trigger their depressed moods or negative thoughts, with the goal of preventing recurrence(18) -When an OT uses the principles of CBT in occupational therapy for treatment of a patient with depression, the OT helps the patient: -alter his or her negative self-view,  in which the patient may see himself or herself as useless, undesirable, or inept(18) -change the way in which the patient interprets the world (e.g., as difficult and defeating) as well as his or her life experiences (failures, punishments, etc.)(18) -revise the patient\u2019s view of the future, in which the patient may expect to have only disappointment, adversity, and suffering(18) -Goals of CBT are accomplished through education as well as activities designed by the OT to facilitate success and foster a sense of self-sufficiency  for the patient(18)  \u2013Authors of a 2018 systematic review and meta-analysis  compared the effect of CBT combined with exercise to either CBT or exercise alone on several factors, including depression,in patients with chronic illness(43) -30 studies were included -CBT with exercise is effective for decreasing depression, but there is not an additive effect of CBT with exercise compared to each condition alone \u2013CBT is an effective treatment for adult depression and is the most studied psychotherapy for depression(31) -Authors of a 2013 meta-analysis  of CBT alone in comparison with other treatments found that although evidence indicates that CBT is effective, a considerable number of lower-quality  studies has probably led to an overestimation of its effectiveness(31) -There was no difference in efficacy between CBT and pharmacotherapy -CBT was no more or less effective than other psychotherapies, including nondirective supportive therapy, behavioral activation therapy, psychodynamic psychotherapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, and problem-solving  therapy \u2013There are different approaches to mindfulness-based  meditation, but the goal of all of them is to calm the mind. The American Academy of Family Physicians\u2019 recommendations state that although evidence is inconsistent, these approaches seem to be an effective treatment for depression. These therapies are safe and therefore recommended to try as an adjunctive therapy(44)",
            "ADLs/IADLs(13) \u2013Developing plans and routines to successfully complete ADLs/IADLs is important for patients with depression for them to feel empowered, motivated, and independent(7) -An important role for the OT is developing routines for medication management and to reinforce the need to take antidepressant medications as prescribed by the physician; remind the patient that initially the medicines can take up to 3\u20134 weeks to take full effect(7) \u2013Allow increased time for patients to complete ADLs/IADLs; provide patient and caregiver education regarding extended time to complete self-care  routines where appropriate \u2013If needed, the OT can help the patient select and then can train the patient to use assistive devices to increase independence in ADLs/IADLs",
            "Tree theme method (TTM)(52) \u2013A client-centered  occupational therapyfor patients with depression and/or anxiety disorders that takes place over 5 sessions with an OT. It is a type of art therapy that involves patients telling their life story. The aim is to increase patients\u2019 abilities to cope with and to enhance their everyday lives \u2013Authors of a study compared the TTM intervention with regular OT treatment in patients with depression and/or anxiety disorders(52) -Patients in the TTM group received 5 sessions of the defined TTM. For consistency, the OT group received 5 sessions as well, even though typical OT treatmentconsists of more than 5 sessions. The OT group received regular OT treatments to help them cope with and increase satisfaction with their everyday lives (e.g., dialogues and activities to maintain activities and structure in everyday life, learning to prioritize among various activities, prescription of assistive devices for cognitive impairments, and creative activities to handle anxiety and stress) -No significant differences were found between the TTM group and the regular OT group in psychological symptoms, health-related  areas, or intervention-related  aspects -Both groups showed improvements from before treatment to after treatment. Therefore, TTM may be an effective treatment for patients with depression and/or anxiety disorders since it had similar outcomes to regular OT treatment practices. More studies are needed to evaluate this method",
            "Exercise \u2013Exercise interventions are a promising alternative for treating depression, as they do not have adverse side effects or high cost often associated with medications and psychotherapy(46) \u2013Based on several systematic reviews and meta-analysis  showing positive effects of exercise on depression, the American Academy of Family Physicians recommends its use as an adjunctive intervention. Yoga, tai chi, and qi gong may also have positive effects on depression(44) \u2013Authors of a 2019 systematic review evaluated the effect of physical exercise for the treatment of depression. They found that adding exercise to pharmacological therapy resulted in a greater reduction in depressive symptoms than pharmacological therapy alone(45)  \u2013Authors of a Cochrane Review of exercise for patients with depression concluded that although it is reasonable to recommend exercise for patients with depression, it was not possible to determine how effective exercise is as a treatment method(22) -The review authors found that exercise had a moderate effect size on depressive symptoms in patients with a diagnosis of depression when compared to no treatment; however, it is likely that the results are biased toward exercise for methodological reasons. In addition, it was unclear if the benefits persist after exercise has stopped \u2013Physical activity, even of light intensity, may be beneficial for older adults with depression(32,33) -Results of a longitudinal repeated-measures  study conducted in Canada indicate that depressive symptoms predict reduced walking frequency later. Higher depressive symptoms tended to precede reduced walking and so are more likely a cause of reduced walking than a result(32) -In a study involving 708 older adults conducted in the United States, researchers found that light-intensity  exercise and moderate-to-vigorous intensity exercise were inversely associated with depression(33) -For every 60-minute  increase in light-intensity  physical activity, participants were 20% less likely to be depressed(33) \u2013Authors of a meta-analysis  of RCTs examined the efficacy of resistance exercise training for reducingdepressive symptoms(46) -33 RCTs were included -Resistance exercise training was associated with a significant reduction in depressive symptoms regardless of age, sex, or health statusand regardless of the program duration,exercise intensity, and frequency of sessions -The evidence supports resistance exercise training as an alternative and/or adjunctive treatment for depression \u2013Authors of a systematic review and meta-analysis  evaluated the effectiveness of aerobic exercise for reducing postpartum depressive symptoms(47) -13 RCTs were included -Exercise significantly reduced depressive symptoms in postpartum women -Group exercise, participant-chosen  exercise, and exercise with co-interventions  may all be effective choices \u2013Authors of a systematic review and meta-analysis  aimed to determine the effectiveness of tai chi on QOL and depressive symptoms in older adults with chronic disease(48) -13 RCTs were included -Tai chi can improve QOL and depressive symptoms -The authors recommend tai chi as a supplementary therapy for managing chronic disease in older adults \u2013For detailed information about exercise and depression, see Clinical Review  Clinical Review ...
