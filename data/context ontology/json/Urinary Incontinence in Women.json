            "Urinary incontinence (UI) is characterized by involuntary leakage/loss of urine(1) \u2013UI is not a normal result of aging; it is a pathologic condition that affects quality of life (QOL)(42) \u2013UI during regular activities of daily living (ADLs) is associated with lower psychological wellness, social functioning, and health-related  quality of life (HRQOL) in community-dwelling  women(3)",
            "UI is common in community-dwelling  women(99) \u2013In a survey in Canada, 51% of women 45 years of age and older reported UI and over one third of them perceived it as a personal and social problem(2) \u2013However, due to embarrassment or lack of knowledge about causes and treatment options, many persons delay seeking medical treatment(43,44,45,99)",
            "UI can be transient or chronic(42) \u2013Causes of transient UI (42,43,46) -Delirium -Infection (urinary tract infection) -Atrophic vaginitis -Pharmaceuticals (e.g., antihypertensives, pain relievers, psychotherapeutics), alcohol -Psychological disorder (e.g., depression) -Excessive urine output (e.g., hyperglycemia) -Reduced mobility -Stool impaction \u2013The main types of chronic UI in women(1) -Stress UI: Leakage during activities that increase abdominal pressure (e.g., coughing, laughing, exerting) -Urge UI: Leakage when overtaken with an abrupt strong desire to urinate; associated with pelvic floor muscle (PFM) spasm, detrusor instability, and nocturia -Mixed UI: Leakage under conditions of both stress and urge -Overflow UI: Leakage (usually continuous dribbling) that results from incomplete voiding (due to an impaired micturition reflex) and excessive urinary retention; may be acute or chronic -Functional: Caused by cognitive, functional, or mobility difficulties that impair the patient\u2019s ability to use the toilet without true bladder dysfunction(42)",
            "For information on management of UI in pregnancy, see Clinical Review\u2026Incontinence, Urinary, Pregnancy-Related ; Topic ID Number: T709017 ",
            "Balance:  Assess static and dynamic balance reactions in sit and stand to perturbations from the front, sides, and rear. Medications and change of center of gravity during pregnancy may affect balance",
            "Cardiorespiratory function and endurance:  Document vital signs, including resting heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate. The 6-minute walk for distance test (6MWT) is an objective measure of functional endurance",
            "Circulation:  Assess peripheral pulses and capillary refill time",
            "Functional mobility:  Assess movement during general activities, including stair climbing and transfers, and any activities directly related to the patient reaching the bathroom in a timely manner. Use the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test or FIM as objective measures",
            "Gait/locomotion:  Observe gait (with assistive equipment as appropriate) and note deviations. Assess safety during gait with the Dynamic Gait Index (DGI)",
            "Joint integrity and mobility:  Assess lumbopelvic and hip joint stability and mobility",
            "Motor function:  Assess for coordinated movement of major joints during general mobility",
            "Muscle strength:  Assess lumbopelvic and core strength with manual muscle testing (MMT). Can assess PFM strength with a stainless steel specular dynamometer(69)",
            "Observation/inspection/palpation:  Palpate for tenderness in any areas of reported pain. Observe for swelling of the lower extremities, which can be related to polyuria and nocturia",
            "Posture:  Assess posture in sit and stand (with and without adaptive equipment, as appropriate)",
            "Range of motion:  Assess trunk and hip joint ROM; does the patient have sufficient ROM to perform toileting?",
            "Reflex testing:  Assess deep tendon reflexes, as indicated",
            "Self-care/activities  of daily living:  Assess whether patient is independent in toileting and self-care  for UI",
            "Sensory testing:  Assess sensation in the sacral dermatomes (see Special tests )",
            "Special tests specific to diagnosis \u2013Several methods may be used to assess the frequency and severity of urinary leakage -Number of protection products used daily -Home pad test: Grams of urine loss in pads/liners used over a standardized period -Short office-based  pad test: Grams of urine lost during an outpatient visit -Bladder diary: Record of the episodes of urine loss experienced over a standardized period \u2013Cough stress test: The bladder should be full. Patient relaxes in supine and/or semi-recumbent  sitting, then coughs vigorously once as the clinician checks for loss of urine. Immediate leakage that starts and stops with the cough confirms stress UI. Delayed or persistent leakage suggests detrusor overactivity that was triggered by the cough \u2013Physical examination (this should be conducted by a continence specialist): Use gloved hand with patient in supine crook-lying  position -Assess sensation in the sacral dermatomes -S2 \u2013 stroke the lateral surface of buttock and thigh -S3 \u2013 stroke the inner surface of the buttock and thigh -S4 \u2013 stroke either side of the anus and perineum -Assess PFM contraction and tightening of the levator ani by transvaginal digital-MMT  exam. (Note: PFM strength can be measured directly by perineometry) -Depending on patient comfort, insert 1 or 2 fingers into vagina (document if painful or not tolerated) -Ask patient to imagine she is trying to stop the flow of urine in mid-stream  or the passing of gas by squeezing only the muscles around the vagina and rectum. Note whether buttocks, thighs, and stomach stay relaxed. Document patient\u2019s response to cueing -Ask patient to hold contraction of pelvic floor for 3-5 seconds and assess squeeze on fingers using Brink Scale:(23) 1 = no response (cannot perceive), 2 = weak (felt as a flick with palpation), 3 = moderate/functional (felt all around fingers), 4 = strong (fingers compressed). Using this scoring system, intravaginal strength was generally weak-to-moderate,  averaging 2.7, in women undergoing surgical treatment for stress UI(23)  \u2013Questionnaires -Broome Pelvic Muscle Self-Efficacy  Scale: a psychometrically accurate and clinically relevant estimation of women\u2019s self-efficacy  in performing pelvic-floor  exercises(70) -Urinary Incontinence Questionnaire (UIQ)(71) -Continence Self-Efficacy  Scale (CSES)(72) -Incontinence Quiz(73) Assessment/Plan of Care"

            "PFMT is currently the mainstay of physical therapy for women with UI \u2013Based on a Cochrane review of 21 randomized trials (n = 1,490 women), evidence is lacking to recommend a \u201cbest practice\u201d approach to PFMT, but women who received weekly supervised PFMT reported more improvement than those who had little or no supervision(28) \u2013A systematic review published in 2014 found that conservative treatments (e.g., PFMT, lifestyle and behavioral changes) are underused and that containment methods are more widely prescribed.(75) Nevertheless, a home-based  PFMT program following instructions may provide some benefit even though not as effective as a supervised program.(29) Various modalities such as biofeedback, electrical stimulation, magnetic functional stimulation, and vaginal weights may enhance the effectiveness of PFMT in those unable to perform a correct and strong contraction due to poor PFM awareness or motor control. Coaching is usually required to suppress the activation of accessory muscles (lower abdominal, gluteal, and thigh muscles) \u2013The therapeutic benefit of PFMT may be greater in stress UI,(7) but moderately strong evidence supports this conservative approach for all types of UI(6,8,76) \u2013The main objective is to improve resting contractile tension and voluntary muscle force and speed of recruitment of the pelvic diaphragm, as well as to improve contraction of the urethral sphincters \u2013The benefits of PFMT appear sustainable for over 6 months post intervention with a maintenance program of exercise either 1 or 4 times per week.(30) This study, which was conducted in the United States, lacked a no-exercise  control group \u2013A systematic review published in 2012 found PFMT to be effective in decreasing UI in older women; however, the small number of studies and the use of concurrent interventions limit the conclusions on this issue(77) \u2013Researchers who conducted a study in India found Video Assisted Teaching Program for Kegel Exercises (V ATPKE) reduced the severity of self-reported  UI symptoms in community-dwelling  women(78) \u2013PFMT has also been shown to be effective in treating UI in postpartum women(79,80,81) -Evidence is not clear as to how effective PFMT is for postpartum incontinence, or for the time when PFMT should be undertaken(106) -Trials investigating PFMT during pregnancy have not shown significant reduction in UI postpartum, whereas PFMT during the postpartum period has been reported to result in a decrease in episodes of UI(106)",
            "PFMT with biofeedback appears to enhance the effectiveness of PFMT in women with UI  \u2013Based on a 2011 systematic review of 24 trials that included 1,583 participants. Women who received biofeedback were significantly more likely to report improved or cured UI compared to those who only did PFMT.(31) However, biofeedback may introduce bias in the research design due to increased patient contact with the clinician, who provides greater attention during PFMT sessions that biases favorable outcomes \u2013According to a study conducted in India, PFMT combined with perineometry biofeedback may increase PFM strength greater than PFMT alone in women with UI(32) \u2013Researchers who conducted an RCT in Turkey found PFMT with biofeedback reduced UI and increased QOL(82) \u2013Researchers in a study in the United States found biofeedback to be a useful intervention in older women to reduce urge UI. It can be taught in 2 visits in a small sub-group  of subjects and the therapy is durable after 6 months(83) \u2013Researchers who conducted an RCT in Australia found that visual feedback using transabdominal ultrasound imaging of the pelvic floor appears to be effective in teaching PFM contractions to older women with UI(84)",
            "Deep abdominal muscle training \u2013Investigators in India found that deep abdominal muscle training alone or in combination with PFMT is effective for reducing stress urinary incontinence(107) -Based on an RCT involving 45 female patients who were divided into 3 groups: deep abdominal muscle training alone, deep abdominal muscle training in combination with PFMT, and advice only (control) -Outcome measures included V AS, abdominal muscle strength, pad weight, and number of leaks -Abdominal muscle training was more effective than control -There was no statistically significant difference between the group receiving abdominal muscle training alone and the group receiving abdominal training in combination with PFMT \u2013Contraction of abdominals during rehabilitation of pelvic muscles was at one time discouraged; however, more recent research has shown a synergy between abdominals and PFM. Women who were treated with pelvic floor rehabilitation by recruiting abdominals showed better results than women who did Kegels exercises in a randomized study conducted in India(108) -Physical therapists used to discourage contracting abdominals during rehabilitation of the pelvic muscles -17 women with stress UI were randomly assigned to 2 groups: pelvic floor rehabilitation by recruiting abdominals or Kegels exercises -All subjects attended the clinic for the first 3 days then were advised to practice at home, with once weekly visits for 6 weeks -Both groups showed improvements on the patient incontinence impact questionnaire but results in the abdominal recruitment group were better relative to the Kegels group",
            "Functional electrical stimulation (FES) \u2013FES is commonly used in urge or mixed UI to elicit the sacral autonomic reflex for relaxing the bladder \u2013Clinicians using transvaginal stimulation should observe the perineum to ensure that an adequate PFM contraction is occurring(33) \u2013According to a study conducted in the United States, bothersome urge UI symptoms associated with PFM spasm improved 64.5% in 52 women treated once weekly for 6 weeks using transvaginal biofeedback and 20 minutes of passive electrical stimulation via vaginal probe.(34) Intervention targeted relaxation of the pelvic floor. Unfortunately, details regarding stimulation parameters were not provided, and this study lacked a control group \u2013According to a study conducted in Brazil, transvaginal FES and PFMT with biofeedback are considered feasible and effective for treatment of detrusor overactivity/overactive bladder; however, most patients do not gain total relief of symptoms with one treatment. Further studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of these combined treatments(35) \u2013Researchers who conducted a study in Brazil found physical therapy intervention that consisted of FES and PFM activation (hip abduction, adduction, and bridging) resulted in patient satisfaction and continence in 88.9% of the cases (82 women participated)(85)",
            "Functional magnetic stimulation (FMS) \u2013In a small pilot study conducted in Australia, FMS was delivered in the sitting position by a magnetic coil (with the perineum positioned over the center of the coil) and applied at the highest tolerated intensity for 20 min (10 min at 10 Hz followed by 10 min at 50 Hz) twice weekly for 6 weeks. The results compared favorably to transvaginal FES in treatment outcomes (patient satisfaction, bladder diary, 1-h pad test, and pelvic floor strength by perineometry).(36) Statistical analysis of results was not reported ",
            "Lumbopelvic stability training and manual therapy \u2013Manual therapy may help to correct PFM dysfunction associated with UI by addressing deficits in musculoskeletal factors(37) \u2013Poor pelvic floor performance may be related to tissue stiffness, reduced PFM strength, poor motor control, reduced PFM endurance, and postural changes resulting from low-back  or pelvic pain, according to a study conducted in Canada(38)",
            "Acupressure \u2013Traditional Chinese acupressure treatments may reduce the severity of leakage in women with urodynamic stress UI -Based on an RCT with 81 Chinese women participants (18 to 60 years of age) randomized to an acupressure-intervention  group, a placebo-sham  group, or a usual-care  control group(39) -Acupressure and sham treatments were administered for 30 minutes, 3 times per week, in 30 sessions -On follow-up,  PFM strength (perineometry), self-reported  severity of leakage, and number of leakage episodes were significantly and relatively more improved in the acupressure group compared to the sham and control groups",
            "Paula Method \u2013A circular muscle exercise protocol that works on the premise that all sphincters are synchronized and movement in one sphincter will affect distant circular muscles in another sphincter. This method has been used in Israel for decades, and the researchers from this RCT found it to be just as effective as PFMT. It resulted in a lower frequency of urinary leakage; however, the Paula Method took more sessions to train patients and therefore cost more overall(86)",
            "A 2014 systematic review found that there is no strong evidence that exercise regimens other than PFMT can reduce stress UI in women(97) \u2013Randomized trials of exercise interventions involving females with stress UI were included. Outcome measures included urinary leakage (e.g., pad test) and urinary incontinence episodes as indicated in questionnaires \u2013Seven studies met inclusion criteria \u2013Data from randomized trials investigating abdominal training, the Paula Method, and Pilates as adjuncts or alternatives to PFMT do not support their effectiveness \u2013No randomized trials examining the efficacy of yoga, tai chi, breathing exercises, postural training, or generalized fitness to treat stress UI were found",
            "A 2013 Cochrane systematic review provides some evidence that weighted vaginal cones are better than no active treatment in women with SUI and may be of similar effectiveness to PFMT and electrostimulation(8) \u201323 trials involving 1,806 women were included. 717 received cones \u2013Results of the trials were difficult to combine because different outcome measures were used \u2013The authors concluded that the results were tentative until larger high-quality trials using comparable outcome measure were completed \u2013Cones could be offered as one treatment option .
