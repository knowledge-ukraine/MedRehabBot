            "speech and language examination": " Speech and language examination (including reading)Speech sound disorders are common among patients with developmental sensorineural hearing loss(15) -Speaking rate is likely to be slower than average(15)To assess speech perception, it is important to consult with the audiologist and refer to the child\u2019s audiogram and audiological testing to understand the effect of the hearing loss on speech perception. Speech perception tests might include word recognition, sentence recognition, and/or identification of prosodic featuresUsing a 100-word  sample (e.g., picture naming) and/or a conversational sample, take a consonant and vowel inventory to assess the distribution of sounds across word positions, syllable and word shape inventories, and word-level stress patterns. A minimum of two productions of a sound is required before the sound can be credited to the phonetic inventory -Children with developmental sensorineural hearing loss do not coarticulate in the same manner as typically developing speakers; hence sound production can sound awkward and result in reduced intelligibilityStandardized tests or an informal (nonstandardized) analysis can be used to determine speech errors that have a high frequency of occurrence, are early developing, and are functionally important for that child and child\u2019s family. For specific sounds, the percentage of omissions, substitutions, distortions, and additions can be completed. A conversational sample can be used to record any difficulties in prosody, fluency, or resonance (e.g., hypernasality)Scales to measure speech intelligibility in children with hearing loss have been found to be quick to administer, discriminative, and reliable. In one method, children are asked to name pictures, and the inexperienced listener can rate the intelligibility of each word on a scale (e.g., poor, pass, fair, good). Scales can also be analogue for quick numerical calculations (e.g., 1\u201310,  \u201cSpeech is completely intelligible\u201d to \u201cSpeech is completely unintelligible\u201d)(16)Standardized tests can be used to classify and quantify phonological processes (patterns relating to sound errors). Children with hearing impairment often produce predictable error sounds patterns (e.g., final consonant deletion) Methods to assess production capacity at the word level can include imitation, key positions (phonetic environment in which the target sound is successfully pronounced), keywords (a word or a limited number of words in which a sound is successfully pronounced), and phonetic placement and shaping (techniques that physically direct a person to the correct production of a target sound)If appropriate age, assess phonological awareness (knowledge about the sound structure of language at the syllabic, intrasyllabic, and phonemic level) by use of a standardized testAssess receptive and expressive language ability -Studies investigating the impact of mild to moderate sensorineural hearing loss have resulted in mixed findings. There is considerable individual variation in language abilities for children with mild to moderate sensorineural hearing loss. In general, research findings indicate delays in phonology, vocabulary (including both signed and spoken words), and morphosyntax compared to typically developing, age-matched  peers, but not in their acquisition of reading(17,75)If receptive and/or expressive language difficulties are suspected, provide a comprehensive language assessment (language sample and standardized tests) to assess expressive and receptive vocabulary and morphosyntactic language. Recorded and transcribed language samples can also provide information on language pragmatics, mean length of utterance, vocabulary diversity, and syntaxMany sign language assessments and checklists have been developed to measure sign language proficiency. As with oral language tests,sign language assessments are developed for a specific linguistic and cultural population, and there are many difficulties and shortcomings associated with adapting tests for other sign languages.(18) Videotaped language samples can also provide information on language pragmatics, mean length of utterance, vocabulary diversity, and syntax -One example of an assessment of communication skills in children with sensorineural hearing loss is the Children's Communication Checklist\u2013Second  Edition (CCC-2).  The CCC-2  is a 70-item  checklist for parents or teachers to complete to screen for communication impairment in children aged 4 to 16 years(75)Assess voice and vocal quality; children with developmental sensorineural hearing loss can present with voice impairments(17) -Suprasegmental errors are common in children with sensorineural hearing loss; speech can sound breathy, labored, staccato, and/or arrhythmic(17) -V ocal quality is often hoarse; pitch can be excessively high, variable, or monotone(17) -Pitch breaks are common in children with developmental sensorineural hearing loss(17) -Note vocal resonance; children with developmental sensorineural hearing loss can demonstrate pharyngeal resonance and hyper-  or hyponasality(17)The typical student with a hearing loss gains only one third of a grade equivalent in reading each year, graduating high school with a 4th-grade  reading level on average.(34) Due to the prevalence of reading difficulties among children with hearing impairment, literacy goals are often addressed in collaboration with the SLP and deaf education teacher. Provide a reading evaluation as age appropriate or refer to a reading specialist/special education teacher. Assessment might include letter identification, letter-sound  identification, phonological awareness skills, site word reading, fluency, and reading comprehension. Standardized and criterion referenced tests can be used to assess academic performance in reading and writing. For detailed information on reading disabilities in children, see the series of Clinical Reviews on this topicStandardized tests can be used to assess phonology, vocabulary, syntax, and phonological awareness. It is important to note the population on which the test was standardized. Some tests have been developed specifically for children with hearing impairment, and a few tests that have been designed for hearing children have been investigated for their validity with children with hearing impairment and CIs.(19,20) Tests that are designed specifically for children who are deaf or have a hearing impairment are often standardized only on children who are also deaf or have a hearing impairment; therefore, the scores will not reflect a child\u2019s performance with regard to the \u201cmainstream\u201d population(21)",

In children who had CIs, better outcomes were associated with earlier age at which the CI was switched on(66)",
            "For children with CIs, variables that have been found to influence prognosis for speech intelligibility and speech perception include age of implantation, daily length of CI usage, total length of CI usage, mode of communication, extent of parent involvement, parent education level, preimplant hearing experience, and nonverbal IQ.(24,25,26,27) (For detailed information on communication assessment and treatment in patients with CIs, see the series of Clinical Reviews on CIs). Multiple studies have cited the benefits of early implantation, with substantial benefit for language outcomes for children receiving their implant(s) before the age 2or 2.5 years.(28,29,30) There is also some evidence that children with CI who use oral communication only in their educational setting have more rapid gains in communication than those who use total communication, but the findings are mixed in other studies and the reverse has been found to be true in some cases(26,27)",

            "The typical student with a hearing loss gains only one third of a grade equivalent in reading each year, graduating high school a 4th-grade  reading level on average.(34) Due to the prevalence of reading difficulties among children with hearing impairment, literacy goals are often addressed in collaboration with the SLP and deaf education teacher; however, research regarding the most effective methods is lacking(34)",
            "Early intervention (EI) \u2013Families benefit from having full and complete information about each modality and option in order to make the appropriate decision regarding communication mode (e.g., oral vs. sign), equipment (e.g., hearing aid vs. CI vs. none), and communication options (e.g., auditory-verbal, auditory-oral,  cued speech, English-based  signs, or ASL).(13) There is evidence that parents\u2019 self-efficacy  is positively associated with their use of higher-level  facilitative language techniques; parent efficacy is often addressed in early-intervention  programs by mentoring language enhancement techniques.(35) Several studies have demonstrated the benefit of family-focused  EI on the development of communication and reading abilities of children with hearing loss(2,36) \u2013In a retrospective study conducted in the United States on the effects of an EI program for children aged 0 to 36 months with permanent hearing loss, researchers found that children enrolled before 6 months of age had higher language skills at the end of the program than children enrolled at or after 6 months of age(37) -The children enrolled prior to 6 months of age maintained language skills over time(37) -Despite initially lower baseline skill sets for the children who enrolled in EI at an age older than 6 months, the researchers found that significant language progress was still achieved during the early intervention program(37) -Researchers stressed the importance of early identification of hearing loss to be able to best serve this population through EI programs(37) \u2013There is much evidence that early exposure to language and print increases a child\u2019s prognosis for later reading ability. Two groups of children with hearing loss have been found to have better than average reading outcomes: -Children with pervasive exposure to sign language who are identified early with a hearing loss. These children are often raised by deaf parents, and sign language is used consistently in the home environment(31,38) -Children who are auditory verbal communicators and whose hearing loss was identified soon after birth. These children have received high-quality audiological management since birth and have received intense auditory intervention(31) \u2013There is also evidence that joint story-book  reading between parents and children is correlated with increased vocabulary knowledge, general knowledge, receptive vocabulary, word recognition, and letter knowledge(31,39)",
            "Ling model for speech intervention(40) \u2013The Ling speech program provides assessment and instructional techniques for improving speech, first at the phonetic level (in nonmeaningful contexts such as sounds and syllables), then at the phonological level (in meaningful words, phrases, sentences, and discourse). Instruction emphasizes daily drill and practice and follows a hierarchy based on ease of production and ease of speech reading. Strategies emphasize the optimal use of the student\u2019s residual and aided hearing (e.g., CI or hearing aids) by focusing on listening and auditory discrimination. When needed, kinesthetic or auditory prompts are used but are eventually faded(40) \u2013The efficacy of the Ling method has been explored in single-group  studies, which have indicated that this method leads to generalization of treated sounds at the phonological level and can lead to improvement of some untreated sounds(41,42,43)",
            "Simultaneous phonological and morphological training \u2013In a two-group  study conducted in Australia, researchers examined the differential effects of phonological training and morphological training. Seventeen students with hearing loss (ages 5\u201311),  10 with CIs and 7 with hearing aids, were divided into two groups and trained daily for 9 weeks (15\u201320 minutes daily) using one method and then the other method for 9 weeks. Phonological training focused on the production of four sounds (/s, z, t, d/) in the final position of words. Results indicated that both training methods led to increased morphological knowledge and speech perception but minimal gains in phonology (speech production). Researchers concluded that the training was too short to result in significant changes in speech production and that both types of training were required for maximum benefit(44)",
            "Auditory training \u2013Auditory training has been used as a method to increase residual hearing ability in children who have hearing aids or CIs \u2013There is little experimental research on the efficacy of auditory training in children, but the research in adults and preliminary research in children suggests that auditory training might be beneficial in increasing awareness of acoustic differences and recognizing fine acoustic distinctions(45,46) ",
            "Computer-based  training \u2013To increase vocabulary knowledge: In a multiple baseline study conducted in the United States, researchers examined the effects of a computer program for teaching vocabulary to 8 participants with hearing loss (ages 6\u201310).  Seven wore bilateral hearing aids and 1 had a CI. Participants were tested and trained 20\u201330  minutes a day, 2 days a week for 10 weeks, on 24 words (nouns) that were individually selected for each subject. Results indicated that all 8 participants learned all words and retained the majority of the words 4 weeks after intervention(47)",
            "Narrative intervention \u2013In a single group study conducted in the United States, researchers examined the effects of a narrative intervention on narrative production on 14 children (ages 7\u201314).  Two subjects had mild hearing loss and the remaining had moderately severe to profound hearing loss. Children listened to repeated readings of two stories and were divided into two groups to role-play  one of the two stories. The children were asked to retell both stories, and results indicated that the complexity of the story retellings was higher for the story the children used role-play for(48)",
            "Auditory-verbal  approach \u2013Authors of a 2014 Cochrane review of articles that investigated the effectiveness of auditory-verbal  therapy (A VT) on development of receptive and expressive spoken language in children with hearing impairment found 13 articles (from a total of 2,233 that were found in the initial search) that appeared to meet inclusion criteria for the review. After thoroughly reviewing the 13 articles, review authors excluded all of them because none met the full inclusion criteria for this review. Authors concluded that there is a lack of well-controlled  studies on A VT in children with permanent hearing loss(69) \u2013In a single-group  study conducted in the United States, researchers examined the language growth of 40 children with significant hearing loss (mean age, 44 months) who received 1 to 4 years of intensive auditory-verbal  intervention. A VT emphasizes the development of spoken language through early identification of hearing loss, amplification, and intensive speech and language therapy in which parents serve as important language models. In this study, parents and children participated in 1 or 2 hours of weekly A VT sessions. Results indicated that mean language receptive and expressive growth rates improved steadily over the 4-year period, at times at rates faster than expected chronological age growth(49) \u2013In a study conducted in Australia, researchers examined the effects of A VT on language and speech production over 9 months by comparing 29 children with moderate to profound hearing loss to 29 children in a control group with normal hearing. Children were matched for language age, receptive vocabulary, gender, and parental education level. Results indicated that both groups made similar gains on standardized speech and language measures in 9 months(50)",
            "Phonics-based  reading curriculum and visual phonics \u2013Goal is to increase decoding and reading comprehension \u2013The efficacy of a systematic phonics instruction curriculum used in combination with Visual Phonics, a system of hand cues and written symbols to represent individual phonemes, has been investigated in several studies. Results indicated that students from kindergarten to middle school with various degrees of hearing loss showed significant improvements on standardized tests of reading skills(51,52,53)",
            "For detailed information about speech and language intervention for children with hearing loss and CIs, see Clinical Review\u2026Cochlear Implants in Infants and Toddlers , referenced above . Problem Goal Intervention Expected Progression Home Program  Communication difficulties related to hearing loss in infancyThe first purpose of early intervention is to help families of children with hearing loss understand and decide on the educational placement and communicative approach that best meets the needs of the child and family. In addition, early intervention might address enhancing parent/infant communication in the chosen communication modality(2)Early intervention _ _ Early exposure to language and print _ _ See Treatment summary , aboveExpected progression will depend on family and child goalsParents will be instructed on strategies to use at home with their child Decreased speech intelligibility due to hearing lossImprove speech intelligibility; increase phonetic and phonemic repertoires, correct error sounds, establish clear links between speech perception and speech production, use adult timing characteristics and suprasegmentals (e.g., prosody).(2) There is also evidence that training in speech production might affect improvements in vocabulary knowledge(54)Speech/articulation intervention _ The Ling speech program _ _ See Treatment summary , aboveProgression will vary according to degree of hearing loss, patient/ family goals, and specific therapeutic tasks; the Ling speech program provides assessment and instructional techniques for improving speech, first at the phonetic level (in nonmeaningful contexts such as sounds and syllables), then at the phonological level (in meaningful words, phrases, sentences, and discourse). Instruction emphasizes daily drill and practice and follows a hierarchy based on ease of production and ease of speech reading. Strategies emphasize the optimal use of the student\u2019s residual and aided hearing (e.g., CI or hearing aids) by focusing on listening and auditory discrimination. When needed, kinesthetic or auditory prompts are used but eventually are faded(40)A home program might include activities that assist in generalization of speech goals  Decreased speech intelligibility related to speech perception, speech production, and grammatical knowledgeIncrease speech perception, grammatical performance, and phonologySpeech perception training _ Simultaneous phonological and morphological training _ _ See Treatment summary , aboveExpected progression will vary according to goals and treatment objectivesA home program might include activities that assist in generalization of speech and morphology goals Decreased comprehension/ listeningImprove auditory perception and residual hearing abilityAuditory training _ See Treatment summary , aboveThe child is expected to understand and detect increasingly complex auditory stimuliA home program might include activities that assist in generalization of comprehension and listening goals Decreased comprehension/ listeningReduce adverse acoustic conditionsEnvironmental modifications _ Children with CIs and hearing aids benefit from environmental conditions that have reduced noise. Classroom modifications that might help to enhance listening include use of barrier walls for small- group activities, use of sound-absorbing materials like carpet and draperies, acoustic ceiling tiles, tennis balls on chair legs in rooms without carpet, bilateral directional microphones, and seating that allows the child to face the teacher directly and is away from noise (e.g., air conditioners, overhead projectors, doorways, and windows)(33,65)N/A Parents might be counseled on how to modify the home environment to reduce noise  Language impairment related to hearing lossExamples of language goals for children who use oral language, sign language, or total communication include increasing understanding of complex units of discourse, building vocabulary and world knowledge, developing verbal reasoning skills, acquisition of pragmatic and syntactic rules of the language, and developing narrative skills(2)Language therapy _ Computer-based training _ _ Narrative intervention _ _ Auditory-verbal approach _ _ See Treatment summary , aboveProgression will depend on language goalsA home program might be implemented to assist with generalization of language goals Literacy impairment Improve reading ability and comprehensionPhonics-based reading curriculum and visual phonics _ See Treatment summary , aboveProgression will depend on specific reading goalsNone specified ."
