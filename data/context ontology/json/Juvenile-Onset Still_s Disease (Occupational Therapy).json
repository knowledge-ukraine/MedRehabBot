Symptoms include GI and behavioral symptoms.

One key change is that initial treatment with DMARDs is recommended over NSAID monotherapy for polyarthritis. Specific recommendations for DMARDS are not included, with the exception for TNFi for sacroiliitis; rituximab is considered only after TNFi, abatacept, and tocilizumab have been tried. Recommendations for the use ofbiologics versus nonbiologics  are included. Janus kinase inhibitors and interleukin17  and interleukin-12/23  inhibitors are listed as drugs with promising effects in current studies. Lastly, new recommendations include escalation of therapy for children with low disease activity to achieve complete disease control(42) A 2016 study compared the long-term  safety and efficacy of etanercept and adalimumab with that of MTX in patients with JIA(37) Data from a German register of patients with polyarticular, systemic, enthesitis-related,  and psoriatic JIA and data from its followup  register was analyzed to determine rates of adverse events associated with each treatment option Results indicated that patients treated with etanercept and adalimumab experienced significantly more serious adverse events and infections than those treated with MTX alone; treatment with etanercept and adalimumab did not lead to a significantly increased risk of developing a malignant disease compared with MTX; treatment with etanercept alone was linked with an increased incidence of irritable bowel disease and uveitis compared with treatment with etanercept in combination with MTX or MTX alone Overall, study data confirmed sufficient long-term  tolerability of etanercept and adalimumab for JIA; the increased adverse events experienced while taking these medications may be due to a more serious disease course than that in patients treated with MTX alone Another 2016 study analyzed blood serum levels of TNF-\u03b1  in 41 children with nonsystemic JIA to determine its relationship with longterm  efficacy of etanercept(38) Serum levels of TNF-\u03b1,  both free and bound to etanercept, were measured just before starting treatment with etanercept and at 6week follow-up  At follow-up,  levels of TNF-\u03b1  were increased despite etanercept being an anti-TNF-\u03b1  drug; the increased levels consisted almost entirely of TNF\u03b1  bound to etanercept; the children who demonstrated the most significant response to etanercept therapy were also those who had increased levels of TNF\u03b1  at follow-up;  84% of the children with the largest increase in TNF\u03b1  serum levels continued to receive the drug 5 years after initiating treatment Results indicated that increased levels of TNF-\u03b1/etanercept  complexes in blood serum after beginning treatment with etanercept can be used to predict the longterm  efficacy of the drug Treatment with DMARDs has been shown to reduce the risk of uveitis onset in JIA(39) Data from the National Paediatric Rheumatological Database in Germany that was entered over an 11-year  time span was analyzed to determine the impact of treatment with MTX and/or TNF inhibitors on the onset of uveitis in JIA patients(39) Results indicated that the risk for uveitis significantly decreased when patients were treated with MTX, TNF inhibitors, or a combination of MTX and a TNF inhibitor in the year before uveitis onset Treatment with MTX within the first year following diagnosis and combination therapy with MTX and a TNF inhibitor had the highest effect in reducing the risk of uveitis onset",
