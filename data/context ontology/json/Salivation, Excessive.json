Two case studies showed no long-term  effects on the reduction of drooling.(26,27)A third study (N = 10) showed variable effects(28) \u2013In another small study conducted in India (N = 30), researchers found that combining traditional therapy (postural changes and education) with oral sensorimotor stimulation (including tapping, pressure, whistling, and vibration) resulted in greater improvements in drooling in children with spastic CP as compared to traditional therapy alone(52) \u2013Authors of an RCT(N = 32) conducted in Turkey found that a therapeutic intervention aimed at improving chewing ability in children with CP resulted in a significant decrease in drooling compared to traditional oral motor exercises. The experimental treatment, Functional Chewing Training (FuCT), involved placing food in the molar area during meals to stimulate chewing and having the children train with chewing tubes to improve function of the chewing muscles. Significantly greater improvements were seen on all outcome measures (Karaduman Chewing Performance Scale, Tongue Thrust Severity, and Drooling Severity and Frequency Scale) in favor of the FuCT intervention over the traditional oral motor exercises(51)",
            "Oral screen (adaptive equipment) \u2013Oral screens are usually fabricated from an elliptical soft vacuum-molded  plastic material that fits into the mouth between the lips and gums, with a small flat protruding ring around which the lips seal. They are typically prescribed as part of an overall intervention to improve oromotor function in children > 4 years of age(44) \u2013Researchers in Ireland conducted a small study (N = 5) to assess the effectiveness of using an oral screen to reduce drooling. Participants ranged in age from 5 to 12 years and were instructed use the oral screen over a 16-week  period. Results indicated the use of the oral screen improved drooling in 4/5 of the children. Children using the oral screen required fewer clothes changed and 1/5 parents reported their child could be showered since the child was able to keep his mouth closed. The small number of participants limit the reliability of the study; further investigation is necessary(44)",
            "Behavioral treatment \u2013The expected progression and outcome of this type of approach is that the patient will learn new behaviors to better manage saliva with gradual fading of cues and reinforcement. Improvement should be noted in a variety of different activities \u2013Authors of a systematic review that included a total of 763 children with drooling related to neurological impairment found that there was low-level  evidence to support the use of behavioral treatments to reduce drooling. Behavioral interventions supported by the low-level  evidence included reinforcement, prompting, self-management,  extinction, overcorrection, instruction, and fading(49) \u2013In a study conducted in India involving 25 children with CP, mild intellectual disability, and a history of drooling, researchers found that a token economy behavior therapy program reduced drooling in these children(29) -Children in the study ranged in age from 5 to 12 years -Subjects were randomly assigned to a control (n = 13) or experimental (n = 12) group -Subjects in the control group received conventional therapy and subjects in the experimental group received both conventional therapy and a token economy program -Subjects in the experimental group were given prompts such as \u201cIf you do not drool and keep your mouth dry, you will get a reward\u201d(29) -Rewards (tokens) included colored pencils, sweets, temporary tattoos, and balls -All subjects participated in an initial baseline assessment, followed by therapy 5 days per week for 20 sessions and a reassessment on the 30th day; therapy was then discontinued and a reassessment of drooling was completed on the 38th day(29) -Mean frequency of drooling was similar in the two groups at the start of therapy (17.22 for experimental group; 21.85 for control group); on the 30th day of the treatment program, the mean frequency of drooling had decreased significantly, to 5.67, for the experimental group but not for the control group(21,29,38) -With no therapy between the assessments on day 30 and day 38, the mean frequency of drooling was 8.36 for the experimental group and 21.02 for the control group(29) \u2013Systematic behavioral treatment has been shown to be effective for participants with and without learning disabilities; however, the a systematic review of the literature reported there is inconclusive evidence regarding the efficacy of this treatment approach(5) ",
            "Kinesio taping \u2013Authors of a small study (N = 15) conducted in Brazil found that Kinesio taping on the orbicularis oris muscles together with traditional speech therapy in children with neurological disorders resulted in significant improvement in drooling(48) \u2013Authors of a small study (N = 30) conducted in Spain found that Kinesio taping on the suprahyoid muscles for a 3-month period resulted in significant reductions in drooling as measured by the Sialorrhea Clinical Scale, the Drooling Rating Scale, and the Drooling Impact Scale(53) . Problem Goal Intervention Expected Progression Home Program Drooling in young childrenMonitor drooling No treatment with monitoring   (1) _ No treatment is often the preferred approach for children under the age of 4 years with mild to moderate drooling. The expected progression is that drooling will resolve by 6\u20138 years of age(1)N/A Monitor extent and effects of drooling Poor management of saliva (children over 8 years of age and adults) due to weak oral musculatureReduce drooling and its effects by strengthening oral musculatureOral motor therapy _ Oral motor programs include training on lip closure, jaw closure, and tongue movements as well as applying vibrations to the mouth and oral cavity(1) _ _ See Treatment summary , aboveGradual progression of intensity and duration of each exercise should increase patient\u2019s management of salivaNo home program has been trialed for oral motor therapy for drooling  Poor management of saliva (children over 8 years of age and adults)Increase awareness of drooling and behaviors that minimize drooling (e.g., wiping, swallowing) by using behavioral proceduresBiofeedback and behavioral modification _ Treatment procedures include:",

            "cueing techniques;",
            "self-management procedures _ See Treatment summary , aboveInitially, the SLP will provide immediate, direct, and intensive feedback and reinforcement when the patient correctly modifies his or her behavior in the desired manner, providing rewards as age appropriate; as therapy progresses, fewer prompting and less intensive cueing structures will be employed as the patient becomes more independent with the saliva management strategiesDue to its intensity, this approach has typically been used in a controlled setting (e.g., residential setting, school, hospital), and no home programs have been discussed Drooling caused by dysphagiaReduce drooling caused by dysphagia while improving swallowing safetyDysphagia therapy _ Therapy for dysphagia will vary according to the results of a swallow evaluation (for additional information on treatment of dysphagia, see series of Clinical Reviews on this topic)As the patient\u2019s swallowing ability improves, the SLP will reduce the number of cues and prompts provided while increasing the difficulty of food and liquid textures in therapeutic trialsHome program will vary with patient goals ."
