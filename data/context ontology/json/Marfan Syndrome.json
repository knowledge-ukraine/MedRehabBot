            "Marfan syndrome is a connective tissue disorder caused by an autosomal dominant genetic mutation that is associated with decreased life expectancy, primarily due to cardiac manifestations.(14) The earliest description of the condition was in 1896 by Antoine Bernard-Jean Marfan(14)",
            "Marfan syndrome typically affects three bodily systems(1,3) \u2013Skeletal \u2013Cardiovascular \u2013Ocular \u2013Also, the lungs and CNS are mentioned in the literature(8,14)",
            "Diagnosis of Marfan syndrome is based on the Revised Ghent Nosology, revised in 2010, which placed more emphasis on aortic dilatation/dissection and ectopialentis (i.e., luxation of the lens of the eye) as criteria and also made genetic testing prominent (although it is still not mandatory, as diagnosis can be made based on the phenotype alone)(8,14) \u2013It also scores the systemic features associated with Marfan syndrome, which include wrist and/or thumb sign, pectus carinatum deformity, hindfoot deformity, pneumothorax, dural ectasia, acetabular protrusion, reduced upper segment/low segment ratio and increased arm/height, scoliosis, thoracolumbar kyphosis, reduced elbow extension, various facial features, skin striae, myopia, and mitral valve prolapse",
            "Incidence and prevalence of Marfan syndrome is based on a study conducted from 2000 to 2012 in Taiwan(15) \u2013Minimal birth incidence: 23.3 per 100,000 individuals, meaning Marfan syndrome will be diagnosed in 1 per 4,286 persons later in life \u2013Prevalence: 10.2 per 100,000 individuals",
            "In a similar study conducted in Denmark from 1977 to 2014, results yielded a prevalence of Marfan syndrome of 6.5 per 100,000 individuals, with a median age at diagnosis of 19 years(17)"

(24) -It is recommended that athletes with unequivocal aortic root enlargement (more than 40mm in adults or more than 2 standard deviations for body surface area in children/adolescents or a z score of more than 2) participate in low-intensity sports only (class IA sports) -Athletes with bicuspid aortic valve aortopathy are allowed to participate in competitive sports as long as the ascending aorta and aortic root are not dilated (less than 40mm in adults or z score less than 2 or within 2 standard deviations from the mean) -Athletes who participate in competitive sports should be closely monitored every 6 to 12 months using echocardiography or MRI Contact/collision sports(6,11)  Extreme sports(6,11) Sports with abrupt acceleration/deceleration(6,11)",
        "The patient must be educated on avoiding activities that increase the strain on an already taxed aorta. Examples include(6,11) weight lifting lifting heavy objects (e.g., furniture) hiking (on challenging grades)",
        "As there is an increased risk for spontaneous pneumothorax, the following activities should be avoided Flying in an unpressurized plane(11) Scuba diving(11) Exercise at high altitude(11)",
