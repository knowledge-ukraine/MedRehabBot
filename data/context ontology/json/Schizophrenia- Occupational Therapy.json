            "Individualized therapy programs \u2013Authors of a study in Japan also noted positive results from an individualized occupational therapy (IOT) program on improving cognitive impairment and symptoms in patients with schizophrenia(19) -Based on a 3-month,  quasi-experimental  controlled trial using a non-randomized  method -Fifty-one  patients with schizophrenia were divided into the IOT group (n = 30) or the group OT (GOT) group (n = 21) -The IOT consisted of a psychosocial treatment program that focuses on motivational interviewing, self-monitoring, individualized visits, handicraft activities, individualized psychoeducation, and discharge planning. Each patient worked with an OT on a one-on-one  basis. The frequency and duration of treatment were individually set for each patient and were adjusted accordingly based on progress. On average patients were seen for 1\u22122 hours, 3\u20135 times per week -Those in the GOT group received treatment that consisted of a physical fitness program, a group handicraft activities program, a group cooking program, a group music program, a recreation program, and a group psychoeducation program. Patients were seen for 1\u20132 hours, 3\u20135 times per week -Results show that the IOT group had 100% retention and significant improvements in the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS-J) verbal memory, working memory, verbal fluency, attention, executive function, and composite score, and in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) positive subscale, general psychopathology subscale, and total score compared to those participating in the GOT group \u2013Authors of a case study of a 53-year-old  male patient with schizophrenia investigated the use of relaxation exercises as part of speech and occupational therapy treatment(10) -Patient presented with negative attitudes regarding communication, low self-esteem,  a high level of social anxiety, and subsequent poverty of speech -Patient was seen for speech therapy to reduce anxiety in communicative interactions -Relaxation exercises were incorporated into the speech therapy sessions; patient was also taking part in occupational therapy for relaxation exercises",
