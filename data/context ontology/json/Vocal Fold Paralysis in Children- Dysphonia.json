For detailed information on treatingChildren with Tracheostomy , referenced above Authors of a case study in the United States of a child with Charcot-Marie-Tooth  (CMT) disease and bilateral VFP reported that treating doctors avoided a tracheotomy in favor of an endoscopic cordotomy (see cordectomy described below).(40) A tracheotomy is warranted in some cases in which the patient\u2019s airway is temporarily compromised and a return of function is expected. Because of the degenerative nature of CMT disease, the treating doctors chose a cordotomy over a tracheotomy to establish a more permanent solution. VFP is rare in children with CMT diseaseIn arytenoid adduction, the arytenoids are surgically rotated in the position of adduction (closure) and are sutured together in this position(14,16,17)Injection of material into the vocal folds allows for medialization, injection laryngoplasty, or vocal fold augmentation (e.g., fat injection, Gelfoam or Teflon injection, absorbable gelatin powder, collagen)(2,9,14,16)The purpose of lateralization is to improve the airway by lateralizing one or both of the vocal folds permanently in children with bilateral VFP.(4) Surgical techniques for lateralization in children may include arytenoidectomy (part or all of the arytenoid cartilage is removed) or cordectomy (partial or whole removal of membranous vocal fold with the vocalis muscle) by laser technique or lateral cervical approach(4)Medialization thyroplasty involves the insertion of a silicon implant through an opening in the thyroid cartilage that pushes against the paralyzed vocal fold, allowing it to make contact with the other vocal fold.(10,16,18) A modified approach to this type of surgery has been recommended for the pediatric population(19) To restore abductive (opening) capability of the vocal folds, the posterior cricoarytenoid muscles can be reinnervated in cases of bilateral VFP. Reinnervation of the adductors of the larynx might be recommended for children with unilateral VFP(4)",

It is important that the SLP begin therapy by educating the patient and family on normal and abnormal vocal function.

            "Patient education about voice function and voice care  \u2013In the first therapy session, the SLP should educate the patient and family members on normal vocal fold function, the effect of VFP, therapy techniques, and vocal hygiene. Pictures and models of the larynx are helpful in assisting patients and family members to understand why the child cannot speak loudly and why his or her voice is breathy(8)",
            "Compensatory strategies \u2013The SLP can use the first few sessions for diagnostic therapy. Strategies to achieve a stronger voice can be trialed. Strategies include:(8) -Patient applies digital pressure to one side of the thyroid cartilage (side with the paralysis) while voicing -Patient turns head to one side and then the other while voicing to determine if one side results in a stronger voice -Patient experiments with a softer, breathy voice rather than a louder, strained voice to realize that a breathy voice is more effective \u2013Undesirable, hyperfunctional vocal behaviors (e.g., speaking too loudly, using too high or too low pitch) should be identified and eliminated during the first sessions",
            "V ocal fold adduction exercises \u2013Half-swallow  boom(8) -The steps to this technique are: -The patient is instructed to take a breath and start to swallow. At the point of the half-swallow,  the patient should say \u201cboom\u201d(38) -The patient produces \u201cboom\u201d in a low-pitched voice using the same technique(38) -The patient produces \u201cboom\u201d louder and with less breathiness(38) -The patient is instructed to turn head to each side and say \u201cboom\u201d each time using the same technique(38) -This technique is used expanded into words and phrases(38) -NOTE: This technique should be used sparingly and cautiously to avoid the development of vocal hyperfunction. There is little empirical evidence to support the use of this technique for VFP(38) \u2013Pushing exercises: might be useful for patients with recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis who have a high pitch of voice production. Steps include: -The patient is instructed to breathe in and posture on a vowel (as if about to say a vowel) without letting the air out(8) -The patient releases the vowel (vocalizes)(8) -The patient is instructed to glide down to a lower pitch as the vowel is released(8) -The patient can push hands together in front of the body or push down on the arms of a chair as the vowel is released. Another way to achieve isometric pressure is to lean into a door with elbows bent(8) -The patient can use the pushing exercise in conjunction with counting to 50 or reciting poetry(8) -Patients should maintain a constant pressure but not excessive effort(8) -The falsetto voice should be extinguished over a 3-week  period(8) -Suggested frequency of this exercise is 3 times a day for the first week, 2 times day for the next 2 weeks, and then once a week. Schedule will vary depending on patient\u2019s progress -NOTE: The patient must be observed carefully for the presence of supraglottic hyperfunction or excessive vocal strain. If these are present, discontinue these techniques(8)",
            "V ocal function exercises \u2013Steps to vocal function exercises include: -The patient is instructed to sustain the vowel /i/ for as long as possible (for pitch, use F above middle C for women and F below middle C for men)(8) -The patient should glide from the lowest pitch to the highest pitch on the word \u201cknoll\u201d(8) -The patient should glide from the highest pitch to the lowest pitch on the word \u201cknoll\u201d(8) -The patient should sustain the vowel /o/ on the notes C, D, E, F, G for as long as possible (female patients start on middle C; males start one octave below middle C)(8) \u2013The patient should produce vowels as gently and softly as possible without hard glottal attack(8)",
            "Lip and tongue trills: practicing lip trills (raspberries) and tongue trills assists the patient to achieve normal laryngeal tension by bringing the focus of the sound forward to the lips and tongue:(8)  \u2013The patient should master the lip or tongue trill at a comfortable pitch. The lip trill might be facilitated if the patient presses cheeks in with two fingers \u2013The patient can practice trills with a variety of vowel sounds and pitch progressions",
