            "A therapeutic modality that uses acoustic energy rather than electromagnetic energy to produce physiological effects.(2) It should be differentiated from diagnostic ultrasound, which is used for imaging internal structures",
            "Ultrasound waves have a frequency greater than 20,000 Hz (0.02 MHz), which is higher than the audible range of the human ear. The frequency range for therapeutic ultrasound is between 0.75 and 3 MHz(2)",

            "Ultrasound is primarily used for elevating tissue temperature.(2) It is considered a deep heating modality (as compared to other heating modalities such as hot packs or whirlpools) because of its ability to heat to a depth of 6 cm(2)",

            "Depth of tissue penetration is determined by the frequency, not the intensity, of ultrasound. In general, higher frequencies (e.g., 3 MHz) are absorbed more in superficial tissues. Lower frequencies (e.g., 1 MHz) penetrate to deeper target tissues(2)",
            "In addition to the production of heat caused by friction between the vibrating molecules, therapeutic ultrasound is also hypothesized to have mechanical effects due to production of small magnitude movements of fluids and ions(2)",
