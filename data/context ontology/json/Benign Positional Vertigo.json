            "Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a disorder in which a person experiences brief episodes of vertigo (spinning sensation) that are triggered by changes in head or body position relative to gravity; there is no vertigo between attacks(1)",
            "The vertigo is episodic and lasts seconds to 1 minute(1)",
            "Typically, there are no auditory symptoms; but there may be complaints of nausea, postural instability, or imbalance(32) that persist between episodes",
            "Seven times more likely to occur > 60 years of age,(1) but can occur in younger persons as well",
            "The diagnosis of BPPV is essentially clinical and is based on the history as well as the direction and duration of the nystagmus that results from specific diagnostic maneuvers(1,33)",
            "Thought to be caused by loose debris from the otolith migrating to a semicircular canal(29) \u2013Canalithiasis: debris is free floating in the inner ear fluid (endolymph) \u2013Cupulolithiasis: debris is adhered to the hair-cell  nerve endings",
            "BPPV can be very expensive to manage, mostly due to delay in diagnosis; in the United States it costs approximately $2,000 to diagnose this condition in one patient(4,7) \u2013It can take more than 70 months for a patient to receive appropriate diagnosis and treatment. Patients seek medical care an average of 8 times before BPPV is diagnosed(7)",

            "Instructions for performing CRT \u2013The Epley maneuver(44) is completed for posterior and anterior semicircular canal(39) canalithiasis as follows: (patient with right-sided  BPPV in this example) -Starting position: The patient should be longsitting so that once in supine position 15\u00b0 of cervical extension can be achieved -Position 1 (supine, head turned 45\u00b0 toward ipsilateral side with 15\u00b0 cervical extension): The patient is reclined quickly to the supine position of the affected side, and 15\u00b0 of cervical extension is attained. The patient remains in this position for 30 seconds after the point when nystagmus and symptoms subside. This usually takes a total of approximately 60 seconds -Position 2 (supine, 15\u00b0 cervical extension, head turned 45\u00b0 toward contralateral side): Next, the patient's head is turned slowly from 45\u00b0 toward ipsilateral side to 45\u00b0 toward contralateral side. The patient remains in this position for 30 seconds after the point when nystagmus and symptoms subside if re-provoked.  This usually takes a total of approximately 60 seconds -Position 3 (lying on side with contralateral shoulder down, head turned 45\u00b0 below horizon toward contralateral side): The body is rolled so that the shoulders are aligned perpendicularly to the floor, affected ear up. The head is then turned further so that the nose points 45\u00b0 below the plane of the horizon. This position is usually held for another 30 seconds -Position 4 (sitting, head turned at least 90\u2013135\u00b0  toward contralateral side): The patient is raised back to the sitting position with the head turned away from the affected side. Patients may experience some dizziness during the procedure. Nystagmus may be invoked. Two to three sessions may need to be performed until patient receives a successful outcome -Ending position: Finally, the head is turned back to the midline \u2013Semont (liberatory) maneuver completed for anterior and posterior semicircular canal cupulolithiasis(44) -Patient starts seated facing the examiner, and then turns head 45\u00b0 horizontally toward the unaffected ear (if posterior canal cupulolithiasis) or affected ear (if anterior canal cupulolithiasis) -The patient is then moved to sidelying, allowing for lying on the side of the affected ear with the patient\u2019s nose pointed upward. Remain in this position for 3 minutes. The debris should move to the apex of the canal -Then move quickly through the seated position, holding the patient\u2019s head in place, until the patient is lying on the side of the affected ear with nose pointed to the ground. Remain in this position for 3 minutes. The debris should move toward the exit of the canal -Then slowly move the patient back to the seated position. The debris should fall into the utricle, where it does not cause vertigo \u2013Modified liberatory maneuver for the horizontal canal is completed for horizontal canal BPPV(2) -Patient starts supine lying with head in 15\u00b0 of flexion -Rotate the patient\u2019s head 90\u00b0 toward affected ear. Remain in this position for 10 seconds -Then rotate the patient\u2019s head to 180\u00b0 in the direction of unaffected ear. Remain in this position for 10 seconds -Repeat these steps 10 times for each ear, then have patient return to sitting \u2013270\u00b0 roll for horizontal canal BPPV(3) -In supine position, therapist applies head rotation of 90\u00b0towards affected. Position is held until symptoms subside. Patient\u2019s head is turned towards midline and therapist waits for 15 seconds and reassesses for nystagmus. After 15 seconds, roll patient\u2019s head 90\u00b0 to the contralateral side and wait for another 15 seconds. Patient body is turned until facing down towards the mat or plinth \u2013360\u00b0 roll for horizontal canal BPPV(3) -The same as 270\u00b0 roll but adds one more 90\u00b0 turn  \u2013Gufoni maneuver for horizontal canal BPPV(29) -Patient starts sitting upright and forward. While maintaining a neutral head position, the patient is briskly tilted to one side -On the healthy side for geotropic form -On the impaired side for apogeotropic form -The patient holds this position for 2 minutes -The head is then turned 45\u00b0 downwards and held for 2 minutes -Finally, the patient returns to sitting position",
            "Research on maneuvers \u2013The Epley maneuver is a safe and effective treatment for BPPV ,based on findings of a systematic review(10) \u2013Based on a meta-analysis,  the Semont maneuver is as effective as the Epley maneuver for treatment of BPPV with respect to recovery rate, recurrence rate, and side effects(41) \u2013Researchers of a meta-analysis  concluded that the Epley maneuver and Semont maneuver were similar in short-term efficacy and safety for the treatment of posterior canal BPPV(42) \u2013Researchers in India who conducted a comparative study found that the Epley maneuver is more effective than the Semont maneuver for patients with unilateral posterior canal BPPV(8) -Fifty subjects participated; 25 were randomly assigned into each treatment group -Each group received 3 repetitions per session, once a day for 5 days for 3 weeks -Outcome measures were the DHI and V ADL \u2013Researchers in Canada who conducted an unblended, nonrandomized, case comparison interventional study found that the canalith repositioning procedure (CRP) (which they described to be the same as the Epley maneuver) is effective in treating BPPV in patients who are status post mild to moderate TBI(22) -Three groups of patients with TBI (BPPV , n = 21; nonspecific dizziness, n = 23; no dizziness, n = 12) -Outcome measures were the DHI and SF-36 -Treatment resulted in significant symptom resolution and improvement in perceived physical health status \u2013Researchers in China evaluated the short-term  efficacy of a computer-controlled canalith repositioning procedure that mimics the Epley maneuver and found it to be a safe and effective treatment for posterior canal BPPV , with success rates similar to those treated with a manual Epley maneuver(23) -One hundred thirty-two  patients participated and 81.8% had full resolution at 1 week \u2013Researchers who published a systematic review in 2014 found that there are 4 very similar maneuvers to treat anterior canal BPPV (including the maneuver described above, which has the best one-treatment  cure rate) and they all are effective and easy and safe to administer(5)",
            "Once the BPPV is resolved, habituation exercises may be performed to address any residual dizziness \u2013Motion sensitivity exercises \u2013 several movements included are the same as those that provoke BPPV symptoms \u2013Brandt-Daroff  exercises(9) -Instructions: Patient sits at the edge of the bed sideways and turns the head 45 degrees horizontally to one side (usually away from the affected side), and then rapidly lies down to the opposite side. The patient stays in this position for 20\u201330 seconds (or until the dizziness disappears, whichever is longer), and then sits back up. The same is repeated for the other side (look to the affected side and lie down to the unaffected side), and the entire exercise is repeated 5 times(9) -Researchers in India who conducted a comparative prospective study found that performing Brandt-Daroff  exercises at home for 2 weeks (5 repetitions, 2\u20133 times each day) is as effective as a single treatment with the Epley maneuver for those with posterior canal BPPV(9) -Thirty subjects were equally divided into 2 groups -Outcome measure was the DHI -Both showed highly significant improvement; the Epley group showed more improvement but the difference was not significant -Brandt-Daroff  exercises are also an important intervention for those who cannot undergo the Epley maneuver (e.g., due to cervical or thoracic spine pathology) \u2013Performing a combination of Brandt-Daroff,  visual, and proprioceptive exercises is effective in reducing dizziness caused by BPPV and improving balance(40)  -Based on an RCT in India -Interventions were performed 5 times a week for 9 weeks -Proprioceptive and visual exercises included closing eyes and imagining a blank background, closing eyes and imagining a checkerboard background, single-leg  stance, heel raises, toe raises, and perturbation training",
            "Researchers of an RCT in Brazil (N = 14) concluded that in older persons with chronic BPPV , the modified Epley maneuver in conjunction with vestibular rehabilitation training (VRT) was as effective for treatment of BPPV as the Epley maneuver alone, suggesting that the addition of VRT does not influence the symptom of dizziness. However, substantial improvements were found in dynamic balance for those receiving VRT and the modified Epley maneuver compared with those receiving the modified Epley maneuver only(26) \u2013All patients received the modified Epley maneuver during the 13-week  trial as needed up to 3 times during a single session. Patients were also given standard post-procedure  instructions \u2013VRT consisted of oculomotor exercises, habituation exercises, standing and dynamic balance training, and lower extremity muscle strengthening. VRT was performed for 50 minutes, twice a week for 12 weeks",
