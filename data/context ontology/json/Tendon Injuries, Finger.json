            "The extrinsic hand extensors can be separated into zones.Injuries in each zone will result in typical deformities/presentations(7,8) \u2013Zone I: distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint -Result in flexion deformity at the DIP which is known as mallet finger(7) -Most often involving the 3rd through 5th digits of the dominant hand -Left untreated, hyperextension of the PIP joint, known as swan neck deformity, may develop due to proximal retraction of the central slip(7) \u2013Zone II: central slip to DIP joint -Often due to a laceration or crush injury(7) \u2013Zone III: proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint -Result from direct forceful flexion of an extended PIP joint, laceration, or bite(7) -Boutonniere deformity can gradually develop if the lateral bands slip volarly. Typically, this occurs 10 to 14 days after the initial injury(7) \u2013Zone IV: metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint to PIP joint -Typically, the lateral bands are not affected with zone IV injuries(7) -Adhesion with resultant loss of ROM is common(7) \u2013Zone V: MCP joint -Most common area of extensor tendon injuries resulting from bites, lacerations, or joint dislocation(7) -The tendon injury most often occurs with the joint in flexion, resulting in the tendon injury located proximal to the dermal injury(7) \u2013Zone VI: carpometacarpal (CMC) joint to MCP joint -Clinically, present similar to zone V injuries(7) \u2013Zone VII: wrist -Complete laceration of the tendons in this area is rare since they are located within a fibro-osseous tunnel and are covered by the extensor retinaculum(7) \u2013Zones VIII and IX -Proximal to zone VII at the musculotendinous junction or muscle belly; injury typically due to open trauma or from retained hardware. Closed ruptures are  uncommon at this level and if they occur result from \u201cviolent-resisted  wrist or finger extension\u201d(20)",
            "The flexor tendons can also be divided into zones which influence repair and impact outcome(10) \u2013Zone 1: Base of the distal phalanx to the middle of the middle phalanx \u2013Zone 2: \u201cNo man\u2019s land\u201d; mid-portion  of the middle phalanx proximal to the neck of the metacarpal (borders of the flexor retinaculum) \u2013Zone 3: Palmar zone, metacarpal neck to the distal edge of the transverse ligament \u2013Zone 4: Carpal canal; underlies the transverse carpal ligament \u2013Zone 5: Extends proximally from the proximal edge of the carpal ligament to the musculotendinous juncture of the long flexor tendons",
            "The flexor system also includes a series of pulleys that serve to keep the flexor tendons from bowstringing, increasing the mechanical advantage of the flexor system. The pulleys are typically injured in lacerations and crush injuries, but can also sustain closed rupture. These can be managed operatively or nonoperatively depending upon the demands of the patient(16)",
            "Extensor tendon injuries are more common than flexor tendon injuries because of their superficial position and relative lack of soft tissue between the tendon and the underlying bone. As a result, the extensor tendons are prone to laceration, abrasion, crush injuries, burns, and bite wounds(9)",

            "In the acute stage, the goals are to protect the repair, prevent tendon adherence, and control edema. In the subacute stage, the goal is to increase ROM. In the later stages, increasing strength and improving hand function are the primary goals",
            "Protection during the healing period usually involves splinting/orthosis and/or taping. Physical or occupational therapists may be responsible for providing or fabricating appropriate orthoses \u2013One approach for nonoperative management of mallet fingers includes the use of elastic tape in addition to splinting. For the initial 4 weeks of immobilization, taping is used in addition to the splint to provide additional support of the DIP in extension.(15) A modification of this approach is to use a steri-strip  to support the DIP prior to the application of a thermoplastic orthosis(18) \u2013For mallet injuries, both custom and prefabricated orthoses can be used for immobilization. Authors of a systematic review designed to compare outcomes with custom versus prefabricated orthoses found that there were fewer skin complications with custom-fabricated  orthoses, but that there was no difference in treatment outcome with regard to extensor lag(17)",
            "The authors of a systematic review comparing the results of controlled active motion versus relative motion extension splinting in zone V and VI injuries found no significant differences in motion between the protocols, but an earlier return to function in the relative motion protocols. In relative motion protocols only the injured digit MCP joint is splinted in extension and uninvolved digits are not splinted(19)",
            "Postoperative splinting/orthosis use and ROM protocol following flexor tendon repair will be dictated by the level of injury and type/strength of repair",
            "Guided early postoperative mobilization is associated with positive outcomes: tendon healing; increased tensile strength; reduced adhesion, stiffness, and deformity; and earlier return to function.(4) Therapeutic interventions may include: \u2013edema and pain control (desensitization exercises as indicated) \u2013scar management \u2013AROM, active assisted ROM (AAROM), and PROM exercises  \u2013strengthening exercises for involved finger(s) and hand \u2013strengthening exercises for the elbow/shoulder of the involved extremity \u2013progressive weight-bearing  on hand \u2013gentle manual mobilization to reduce pain and stiffness \u2013functional training (e.g., dexterity exercises) \u2013therapeutic modalities, as indicated, to improve swelling, joint stiffness, and ROM . Problem Goal Intervention Expected Progression Home Program Pain and tenderness Eliminate/decrease pain and tendernessPhysical agents/ mechanical modalities _ Ice/cold to reduce edema and pain following therapy sessions or completion of home exercise programReduced need for modalities over timeInstruct patient in use of ice as needed at home Edema Decrease edema Manual therapy _ Retrograde massage may be used in the acute stages to reduce edema _ Physical agents/ mechanical modalities Whirlpool treatment (only if able to maintain appropriate positioning), ice/cold to reduce swellingPhysical agents/ mechanical modalities _ Coban wraps are often used to decrease scar thickness and to control edemaInstruct patient in edema management techniques (e.g., elevation, retrograde massage, Coban wrapping-distal to proximal) Scar adhesion formationImprove scar suppleness and decreased adhesionsManual therapy  Scar massage and soft tissue mobilization _ Mechanical modalities Silicone strips, silicone caps, and elastomer/ otoform for scar compressionIncreased tolerance of scar mobilization activities; increasingly supple scar _ Scar massage should also be used once sufficient wound healing has occurred in order to prevent adhesions and increased scar thickness that can impair ROM and tendon mobilityInstruct patient in scar management activities and use of mechanical modalities at home  Alteration in skin integrityFacilitate wound healingWound care _ Following open injuries to the finger or hand, the patient may require dressing changes, and, in some cases, may require debridement of the wound. As with splinting and ROM restrictions, close communication with the surgeon/physician is required when selecting the type of dressing to be usedProgress as indicated and appropriate for each unique patientInstruct patient and caregiver in proper wound care management At risk for further damage to tendonsPrevent damage and promote proper healing of tendonsSplinting/tendon protection _ Splinting/orthosis use is often required during the first several (4\u2013 6) weeks following tendon injury to prevent further tearing of the tendon and to allow the tendon to heal. For example, extensor tendon injuries in the area of the PIP joint are often splinted into full PIP joint extension, while allowing MCP and DIP joint motion. The type of splint and the position of the joints within the splint vary significantly from patient to patient, and are based on a number of factors, including hand surgeon/physician preference, the location of injury to the tendon, the tendon(s) involved, and the presence of damage to nerves, arteries, bones, or other surrounding structuresDiscontinue splinting when ordered by physicianDiscontinue orthosis use when ordered by physician  Reduced ROM, primarily AROM deficits due to stiffness, contractureImprove AROM/ PROM of the involved finger, as well to other areas found to be deficientManual therapy _ Early passive mobilization has been shown to increase the tensile strength of the tendon and should be initiated early in the rehabilitation program(3) _ _ Active mobilization exercises _ During the first several weeks following tendon injury, stretching activities may be performed within the ranges set by the hand surgeon/physician. The patient may be instructed in self- PROM of each joint in an isolated fashion, taking care to position the proximal and distal joints so that the tendon to be stretched is slackened at those joints, while being stretched at the joint involved _ _ Blocking exercises of the PIP and DIP joints may be initiated once tendon healing has occurred. Adequate support to the proximal joint is necessary to allow for isolated flexion and extension of the jointTherapeutic exercises _ PROM and isolated joint stretching will help to prevent joint stiffness and contracture, which can develop as a result of prolonged disuse and splinting _ _ As in patient self- PROM, mobilization of the joint should be performed in a protected position, with the proximal and distal joints positioned with the injured tendon on slack _ _All activities should be gradually introduced during therapy sessions to ensure that the patient provides adequate protection to the tendon while performing stretching and strengthening activities. _ The home exercise program should include AROM, self-PROM, and strengthening and stretching activities that are appropriate to the phase of healing (see above)  Muscle weakness Increase strength of individual musculature, as well as grip/pinch strengthTherapeutic exercises _ In most cases, strengthening exercises to the affected digit/ tendon are not appropriate for the first 4\u20136 weeks until sufficient healing has occurred, and adequate tensile strength of the tendon exists. This timeframe may vary based on the extent of the damage to the tendon _ _ Physical agents/ mechanical modalities Electrical stimulation to assist with functional strengtheningStrengthening should begin with AROM of the affected digit, followed by gentle manual resistance, progressing to grip strengthening activities, including therapy putty, clothespins, dynagrips, flexigrips, and other hand-strengthening equipment _ _ Wrist strengthening exercises should be initiated once tendon healing occurs to increase wrist flexion and extension and forearm pronation and supination. Strengthening should begin with AROM, progressing to resistive exercises using dumbbells and weighted sticks _ _ In some cases, such as in distal finger tendon injuries, wrist strengthening may be performed earlier, with the affected digit splinted in place in a protected positionInstruct patient in a home exercise program to complement the physical therapy exercise program, which should be progressed as the patient moves through phases of healing  Impaired hand function Improve functional use of affected handFunctional training _ Dexterity activities may be incorporated in the later phases of treatment to facilitate improved coordination and functional use of the affected hand. These activities may include braiding, spinning jacks, threading needles, unlocking padlocks, or any other occupational/ leisure-related activities that are specific to the patientN/A Instruct patient in a home exercise program to complement the physical therapy program, which should be progressed as tolerated ."
