            "In a single-blind  RCT conducted in the United Kingdom with 72 participants who had memory deficits resulting from neurological impairment, researchers compared the efficacy of a self-help  control group to that of a compensation training memory group and a restitution memory group(48) \u2013Participants were randomized to one of the groups; each group received 10 sessions, each 90 minutes in length. A manual was used to guide each treatment session \u2013In the compensation group, content included discussion of external and internal (see above) memory strategies as well as use of errorless learning \u2013In the restitution group, the discussion was mainly focused on internal memory aids, with some discussion of external aids, as well as the value of attention for supporting memory function \u2013In the self-help  group, the topics of discussion were relaxation and coping strategies \u2013At the conclusion of this trial, there was no significant difference on the Everyday Memory Questionnaire between any of the three groups\u2019 scores(restitution 36.6, compensation 41.0, self-help  44.1). There was a significant difference between groups on the Internal Memory Aids Questionnaire, with the compensation and restitution groups each using significantly more internal memory aids than the self-help group \u2013In a later study conducted by the same authors with a smaller group of participants, the researchers calculated the time spent discussing memory rehabilitation in each group. Participants in the compensation and restitution groups spent significantly more time discussing memory rehabilitation than did the participants in the self-help group. Despite this significant difference, there was no overt improvement in everyday memory in any of the three groups(49) \u2013In a later study, the authors examined the data from a subgroup of individuals included in the original trial\u2014persons with multiple sclerosis. The original study included 39 persons with the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis: 17 were in the restitution group, 12 in the compensation group, and 10 in the self-help  group. Researchers found that there was no difference between the intervention groups (restitution or compensation) and the self-help  group in terms of self-reported memory problems at the conclusion of the trial. There were significant differences in the emotional states of the two intervention groups at both 5- and 7-month  follow-ups  as measured by the Wimbledon Self-Report  Scale (an assessment of emotional state).(55) Researchers found that persons with multiple sclerosis who experienced memory deficits were in less emotional distress when treated with compensatory strategies rather than restitution techniques(55) \u203aSpecific treatment approaches for memory impairment",

Forty total participants (each of whom had a study partner such as a caregiver, spouse, or child) were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. Both groups received an MSS; however, in the intervention group, the participants were trained in the use of the MSS. The control group received no training. The MSS had three sections: appointments, \u201cto-do\u201d  items, and a journaling section. The intervention consisted of twelve 1-hour training sessions conducted over 6 weeks to demonstrate how to use the MSS to improve daily function. Significant improvements in functional ability, memory self-efficacy,  and adherence were documented in the intervention group; however, no changes were observed for the control group. Additionally, improved mood and quality of life was documented in the intervention groups\u2019 study partners; however, a worsening mood and sense of caregiver burden was observed in the control group. Improvements were maintained at an 8-week  follow-up assessment. Researchers highly recommended use of an MSS for persons with MCI(45) -In another RCT conducted in the United States, researchers compared the effects of two types of cognitive rehabilitation interventions on the caregivers of persons with MCI. In addition to two intervention groups, there was also a control group. The two interventions were MSS (described above) or computer-based  cognitive training (\u201cBrain Fitness\u201d). All interventions were delivered in 10 hours; the subjects either participated in 5, hour-long sessions per week for 2 weeks or 50-minute  sessions delivered over 6 weeks (3x/week for 2 weeks, 2x/week for 2 weeks, 1x/week for 1 week). At the conclusion of the study, researchers found that both cognitive interventions had a significant, positive impact on level of caregiver depression as measured by the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D)  compared with the control group. Over the course of 6 months, the caregiver burden and depression levels improved for the MSS group, remained stable for the computer-based  training group, and worsened for the control group(65)  \u2013In an RCT with 48 subjects with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder, researchers investigated the effect of the addition of memory support to cognitive therapy. The trial included 14 once-weekly  sessions that were 50 minutes in length; half the subjects received cognitive therapy alone and half the subjects received cognitive therapy plus memory support. The purpose of the memory support was not to improve memory function itself, but rather to improve adherence to treatment for depression. Researchers found that incorporation of memory support strategies into cognitive therapy increased patient adherence to the therapy regimen and led to better recall of the information presented in treatment sessions.(60) The following is a list of the strategies used in this study:(60) -Attention recruitment: a strategy in which the clinician attempts to focus the patient\u2019s attention to specific treatment points. Either the clinician uses phrases that explicitly tell the patient that something is important to remember (e.g., \u201cIf there is one thing you should always remember from therapy, it is this skill\u201d) or the clinician provides information in a multimodal way to capture the patient\u2019s attention (e.g., handouts, poems, songs, note-taking,  role-playing,  rhyming, stories) -Categorization: helping the patient group similar treatment points into a single category (e.g., \u201cLet\u2019s make a list of ways to prevent falls in the future\u201d) -Evaluation: allowing the patient to evaluate a specific treatment topic by having him or her discuss the pros and cons or by coming up with an alternative solution to a problem (e.g., \u201cWhat are the pros and cons of slowing down when you\u2019re eating a meal?\u201d or \u201cWhat other ways can you reduce your risk of choking when you are eating?\u201d) -Application: having the patient come up with situations in which a new treatment strategy could help in the past, present, or future (e.g., \u201cHow could you have used your word-finding  strategies to help you discuss your medications with the doctor?\u201d) -Repetition: the clinician repeats the same information frequently throughout the session (e.g., \u201cAs a reminder\u2026\u201d or \u201cTo review this again\u2026\u201d) -Practice remembering: the clinician asks the patient to reteach newly learned information back to him or her -Cue-based  reminder: training the patient to use external memory strategies to remember new information (e.g., \u201cRemember, when Jeopardy  comes on, it\u2019s time for your evening medications\u201d) -Praise recall: the clinician provides positive feedback during sessions when the patient recalls something learned in therapy (e.g., \u201cThat\u2019s exactly right! You are supposed to alternate your solids and liquids during meal times. Great job!\u201d) \u2013Authors of a systematic review of 9 research studies (540 individuals total) that assessed the effects of external memory aids for improving memory functioning in patients with MS concluded that there was not enough evidence to validate or refute the effectiveness of external memory aids for individuals with memory impairment associated with MS(63) \u203aAssistive technology",
            "In an RCT conducted in the United States with patients with memory impairment resulting from TBI, researchers found that a television-assisted  prompting (TAP) system (which provided audiovisual reminders for prospective memory tasks through the person\u2019s home television) was significantly more effective than having no prompting to complete everyday prospective memory tasks around the house(41)",

            "In a pilot study conducted in Italy with 20 subjects with MCI, researchers examined the efficacy of a working-memory training program. Participants in the study were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group.(46) Both groups of subjects participated in five 90-minute  sessions; during sessions 1 and 5,both groups completed the pre- and posttests. For those in the intervention group, working-memory  training occurred in sessions 2, 3, and 4. In the training sessions for the intervention group, the researcher presented audio-recorded  lists of words that were organized in the same way as in the Categorization Working Memory Span test. Participants were instructed to recall target words and tap their hand on the table every time an \u201canimal\u201d name was spoken. Examples of recall tasks included recalling the first and last word of every series or recalling only the words that were preceded by a beep. In the control group, sessions involved completing questionnaires on memory failure, discussions on external memory aids, and practice with memory strategies. The main outcome measure was the Categorization Working Memory Span test, as this is what the training was intended to improve. The intervention group had a significantly higher average group score on the posttest than the control. To assess carryover, researchers used several outcome measures that tested different aspects of memory. For most of these tests, no carryover was evident for either group. In a list-recall test that assessed long-term  memory, there was a tendency for those in the intervention group to perform better than those in the control; however, it was not statistically significant. On scale 3 of the Cattell test (which assesses fluid intelligence), those in the intervention group performed significantly better than controls in the posttest. Researchers concluded that working memory training for persons with MCI was a promising intervention and recommended further research with larger groups of participants(46) \u203aCognitive Behavioral Model of Everyday Memory(22)",

            "The theory behind errorless learning is that memory (or whatever skill is being targeted) will improve because the patient will not have errors reinforced; only correct responses are reinforced \u2013Authors of a review of literature found that the body of research on errorless learning for improving recall in patients with memory impairment has shown mixed results for overall memory improvement. Studies that used SR for memory impairment consistently showed improvement in recall for these patients. When errorless learning was used in SR training, although there were significantly fewer errors made errorless learning was associated with the poorest performance on the final outcome measures for recall. There is no standardization for errorless learning therapy techniques and further research is warranted regarding its effectiveness for memory impairment(40) \u2013In a study conducted in South Korea with 29 subjects with memory impairment related to dementia (either vascular dementia or Alzheimer\u2019s disease), researchers found that SR training using errorless learning resulted in significant improvements in memory for patients with vascular dementia. Improvements in memory were also observed in the patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease; however, they were not statistically significant. In this study, subjects participated in 30 minutes of training per day for 5 weeks.
