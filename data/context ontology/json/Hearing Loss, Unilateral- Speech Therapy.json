Teachers can complete the SIFTER to determine if the student is academically at risk(11)Not all individuals with UHL will exhibit problems with language; however, the prevalence of language impairment is higher among those with UHL as compared to those with normal hearing abilities.(39) If receptive and/or expressive language difficulties are suspected, a comprehensive language assessment (language sample and standardized tests) should be performed to assess expressive and receptive vocabulary and morphosyntactic language. There are no tests of language abilities that have been standardized on individuals with UHL; hence, results must be interpreted with  caution.(39) Recorded and transcribed language samples can also provide information on language pragmatics, mean length of utterance, vocabulary diversity, and syntax -In a case-control  study conducted in the United States, researchers compared the language skills of 74 children with UHL and their sibling matched pairs (ages 6-12).(29) The children with UHL had significantly worse scores than their siblings in language comprehension, oral expression, and oral composite on the Oral and Written Language Scales (OWLS). They also found that poverty was associated with similar decreases in speech-language scores. They advocate reconsideration of the common practice of withholding accommodations for children with UHL -Researchers in the United States compared language skills of 20 adolescents with UHL with 13 sibling controls.(25) They found that adolescents with UHL demonstrated worse overall expressive language scores on standardized language measures than the controls. They recommended early speech-language  intervention for children with UHL -The need for early intervention and use of amplification devices for children with UHL was advocated in a review of articles on UHL and academic performance published between 1986 and 2012.(30) The authors of the review emphasized that UHL can lead to poorer listening in noise, poorer academic performance, and lower self-esteem",

A minimum of two productions of a sound is required before the sound can be credited to the phonetic inventoryStandardized tests or an informal (nonstandardized) analysis can be used to determine speech errors that have a high frequency of occurrence, are early developing, and are functionally important for that child and child\u2019s family. For specific sounds, the number of omissions, substitutions, distortions, and additions can be completed. A conversational sample can be used to record any difficulties in prosody, fluency, or resonance (e.g., hypernasality)Standardized tests can be used to classify and quantify phonological processes (patterns relating to sound errors). Children with hearing impairment often produce predictable error sound patterns (e.g., final consonant deletion)Methods to assess production capacity at the word level can include imitation, key positions (phonetic environment in which the target sound is successfully pronounced), keywords (a word or a limited number of words in which a sound is successfully pronounced), and phonetic placement and shaping (techniques that physically direct a person to the correct production of a target sound)If the child is at risk for reading difficulties and is at the appropriate age, assess phonological awareness (knowledge about the sound structure of language at the syllabic, intrasyllabic, and phonemic level) by use of a standardized testStandardized and criterion-referenced  tests can be used to assess reading and writing levels -Authors of a meta-analysis  that included 4 studies (all high quality) comparing performance on intelligent quotient (IQ) tests between children with UHL and children with normal hearing reported that the children with UHL had significantly lower scores on full-scale  and performance IQ tests(37) -Forty-six  children with UHL in the United States (ages 6-12 years) were studied over a 3-year  period to determine changes in cognitive ability, academic achievement, and language.(28) The children demonstrated improvement in oral language (from low average to average) and verbal intelligence; however, they did not exhibit improvements in academic performance.

Significant differences on the Attention subscale of the Screening Inventory for Targeting Educational Risk (SIFTER) found children with minimal hearing loss described by their teachers as having greater attention problems than their normal hearing peers. Researchers hypothesized that the students struggled with selective attention. Within the group of children with minimal hearing loss, psychoeducational difficulty was associated with delays in identification of hearing loss, low maternal education, and use of amplification Specific tests and measuresThe advent of universal hearing screenings in the United States and other developed countries has led to increased identification of children with UHL at an early age.(8) Evaluations by specialists in otolaryngology, ophthalmology, genetics, speech-language  pathology, and early intervention are recommended when sensorineural hearing loss has been detected.(2) When retrocochlear hearing loss is suspected, a neurologic evaluation is recommended.(2) Children with UHL sometimesexhibit subtle problems in the classroom that might go undetected by a traditional speech-language  screening tool, and it is important to supplement screening information(6) -Researchers in Canada reported 20-year  data on children with mild hearing loss in one Canadian region before and after the implementation of a universal newborn hearing screening program.(26) They found that after program implementation, children with UHL were identified an average of 4 years earlier than they had been before the program; however, over half of the children who received recommendation for amplification experienced a considerable delay between identification and amplification (up to a 6-year  delay)A comprehensive audiological assessment is performed by an audiologist and includes air and bone conduction threshold assessment, speech reception thresholds, measures of word recognition ability, tympanometry, ipsilateral and contralateral acoustic middle ear muscle reflex threshold assessment, and evoked otoacoustic emission",

            "Amplification for Children: In a study conducted in Canada in which researchers described clinical practices following universal newborn hearing screening, it was reported that amplification was recommended for over 90% of children who had UHL or mild bilateral hearing loss; however, only 63.3% used the amplification consistently or at school only. For the children with UHL, there was no relationship between degree of loss and use of amplification. The researchers recommended further research into the potential benefits of amplification and determinants of its use for these children.(27) The device should be tailored to the needs of the individual child, and caregivers/teachers should be trained on how to care for the child and use the system(13) \u2013In a repeated measures design study (N = 6) conducted in the United States, researchers compared three types of audiological recommendations for school-aged children with UHL in different simulated classroom listening conditions (unaided, Contralateral Routing of the Signal [CROS] amplification, FM system). The CROS amplification system amplifies the signal from the poorer side by routing the signal to the better ear (wired or wireless). The FM system was the only system to produce uniformly high speech recognition scores across various listening conditions(14) \u2013In a study of 8 children (aged 7-12 years) with UHL conducted in the United States, researchers investigated the effects of conventional hearing aid use on speech perception and on subjective measures.(15) Speech perception measures included the Bamford-Kowal-Bench  Speech-in-Noise  Test and the Nonsense Syllable Test. Subjective measures included the CHILD (Child and Parent), the Learning Inventory for Education (LIFE), and the Hearing Environments and Reflection on Quality of Life (HEAR-QL).  Two teacher measures were also included: LIFE Teacher and the SIFTER. No significant change was found on speech perception measures after the children had 3 months of hearing aid use. Subjective measures indicated significant hearing aid benefit at home and school (as reported by children and parents) and quality of life (as reported by the children)(15) \u2013In another study conducted in the United States, researchers compared the effectiveness of FM auditory trainers, conventional hearing aids, and CROS aids in children (N = 6) with varying degrees of UHL. Word recognition with each of the forms of amplification was evaluated both in quiet and in noise in a classroom. All 6 children in the study experienced significantly better performance in word recognition with the FM trainer. The children with the most loss derived the greatest benefit(16) \u2013Bone-anchored  hearing aids have been used with success in adults with UHL, but their effectiveness in children has not yet been determined. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) restricts the use of surgically implanted bone-conduction  devices in children(12) \u2013Survey data suggests that some parents of children are satisfied with the use of conventional hearing aids (to poorer ear), but there is limited direct and empirical evidence to support the use of traditional hearing aids for the impaired ear in children with UHL(12) \u2013In a study of 12 children with UHL in the United States, researchers investigated how age of amplification, early intervention, and degree of hearing loss affected localization ability.(9) The researchers found that a hearing aid in the impaired ear improved localization ability in children who received hearing aids and intervention at an earlier age (by the age of 5 years); however, children who received intervention at age 9 or older showed bilateral interference (localization ability decreased when the hearing aid was worn)",
            "Environmental modifications \u2013In a study conducted in Seoul, South Korea, researchers compared the speech discrimination scores (SDS) of adults, normal hearing students, and students with UHL in a simulated classroom environment.(17) SDS scores were measured at a distance of 3, 4, 6, 8, and 10 meters to determine optimal seating distance from the speaker for a student with UHL. Researchers found that the group with UHL needed to be seated at 6.27 meters from the speaker to have equivalent scores of the normal-hearing group at 10 meters from the speaker. The researchers concluded that students with UHL require seating ranging from 4.35 meters to no further than 6.27 meters away from the teacher",
            "Amplification for adults: Adult patients with UHL often have difficulty localizing speech or sound, understanding speech in the poorer ear, and understanding speech in background noise. Audiological management is the main course of intervention with adults and includes counseling related to communication problems and providing amplification recommendations.(18) The following are possible amplification options for adults: \u2013CROS amplification to the better ear (wired or wireless). Published clinical guidelines have reported that few patients with normal hearing in the better ear report that any benefit attained using CROS amplification is outweighed by the harshness or tinniness of the amplified sound heard in the better ear. Thus, conventional CROS amplification has been found to be more successful with adults who have a mild hearing loss in the better ear(18)  \u2013In a study conducted in Brazil with 30 adults with moderate to severe UHL, researchers found that use of programmable, behind-the-ear  hearing aids resulted in significantly improved speech perception in noise. Baseline measures were taken prior to the hearing aid fitting and outcome measures were taken after the patients had worn the hearing aids regularly (8+ hours per day) for 3 months(36) \u2013Bone-conduction  aids (eyeglass): A microphone, amplifier, volume control, and bone conduction receiver are mounted in the eyeglass arm with a vibrating pad projecting slightly toward the mastoid process on the side of the impaired ear. It delivers sound from that ear, routing it transcranially via bone conduction to the cochlea of the normal ear. A bone conduction aid might allow better awareness of sound arriving on the side of the poorer ear. Published clinical guidelines have suggested that bone conduction aids do not appear to improve localization significantly or the recognition of speech dramatically in high levels of background noise for most patients, but despite these drawbacks, many patients prefer this type of amplification to the CROS(18) \u2013BAHA: A BAHA is another type of bone-conduction  hearing aid for which the patient undergoes outpatient surgery in which a titanium screw and abutment are implanted into the mastoid process on the side of the poorer ear. The advantage of the BAHA is that it transmits amplified sound directly through the skull without interference from the intermediate tissue. The patient might be a BAHA candidate if he/she: -Is at least 5 years old -Has better air conduction pure-tone  average (ACPTA) at 500, 1000, 2000, and 3000 that is 20 dB HL or better -Is free from a disease that may prevent good wound healing -Is unable to use conventional air or bone conduction hearing aids -Is strongly motivated toward this surgical procedure -Is able to understand the objectives of this amplification -Is able to maintain the hygiene of the percutaneous abutment(18) \u2013In a study conducted in the United States involving 23 children with unilateral deafness who received BAHAs over a 3-year  period concluded that a BAHA can improve hearing in noise and in listening difficulties in children with profound UHL.(19) The complication rate among the subjects was 17% (n = 4) \u2013In a study conducted in India with 24 adults with unilateral hearing loss, researchers found that digitally programmable BAHAs provided a significant hearing benefit in both quiet and noise; speech identification scores improved 20-40%  after implantation of the BAHA.(33) Authors of a retrospective study conducted in the United Kingdom with 90 adults with unilateral sensorineural hearing loss, researchers found that almost half of the patients who were considered candidates for implantation of a BAHA declined the procedure because they did not perceive any benefit in pre-implantation  trials(34) \u2013Cochlear implants: -Authors of a systematic review published in 2016 that included 17 articles investigating the effectiveness of cochlear implants in patients with UHL reported that there were no high-quality  studies (i.e., randomized controlled trials) and there was a high degree of heterogeneity among the patients included in the studies. For these reasons, it was difficult for the authors to make firm conclusions about the effectiveness of cochlear implantation for UHL. In general, the results of the studies included in this review indicate that cochlear implantation does tend to improve sound localization, speech perception, and tinnitus in individuals with UHL(35) -Authors of a systematic review published in 2016 that included 5 studies on cochlear implantation on children with unilateral hearing loss concluded that although speech perception in noise, sound localization ability, speech and language abilities, and quality of life were each reported to improve in at least one study in the review, the overall level of evidence was low. The review authors could not make any conclusions on the efficacy of cochlear implants for children with UHL due to small sample sizes, heterogeneity of study populations, and low quality studies(38) -In some cases unilateral cochlear implantation is performed because both ears are hearing impaired, but only one to the extent that would qualify for cochlear implantation. In these cases, improved outcomes are associated when a hearing aid is used on the better hearing (non-implanted)  ear(41)",
            "Sound localization training \u2013In a study conducted in the United States with 11 adults with severe to profound UHL, researchers investigated the effectiveness of a sound localization training program. For the pretraining, training, and posttraining assessment, participants sat facing an arc of 15 loudspeakers, each placed 10\u00b0 apart. In pre- and posttraining assessments, a monosyllabic word was played from one of the loudspeakers at 60 dB. SPL and the participants were asked to identify which loudspeaker played the word. During the 5 hour-long  training sessions, participants were given visual and verbal  cues about where the sounds were coming from and feedback was provided after each trial. Average group scores in the posttraining session were significantly improved in terms of sound localization as compared to the pretraining session. Due to the small study size, researchers could not make firm conclusions about efficacy; however, they recommended further research on sound localization training for individuals with UHL using larger sample sizes(40) . Problem Goal Intervention Expected Progression Home Program  Language delay or disorder(20) _ _ Speech (articulation) delay or disorder _ _ Localization difficulties(6) _ _ Poor phonological awarenessResolve language or speech delay or disorder _ _ Improve localization _ _ Improve phonological awareness _ _ Speech-language goals will depend on assessment outcomes and can include increasing speech intelligibility by reducing error sounds, increasing language ability (e.g., vocabulary, syntax, narrative ability), or targeting academic needs such as phonological awareness and text comprehensionReferral _ An audiologist should be consulted regarding amplification. The device should be tailored to the needs of the individual child and caregivers/teachers should be trained on how to care for and use the system(13) _ _ Language intervention _ The primary purpose of language intervention is to increase communication skills, including vocabulary and syntax. Long-term effects on language development are minimal in children with UHL, and there are no present studies on language intervention in this population. Goals should be formed on the basis of a thorough language assessment and tailored to their communicative needs _ _ Speech/articulation intervention _ The primary purpose of speech/articulation invention is to improve speech intelligibility. Possible goals include increasing phonetic and phonemic repertoires and correcting error sounds. There are no present studies on speech intervention with children with UHL.

        "Regular screening of children with UHL should be performed to determine if hearing sensitivity remains stable in both ears.(8) Audiograms are recommended every 3 to 4 months in the first year after the hearing loss is identified to monitor any progression of hearing loss. In some cases, UHL has been found to be an initial manifestation of bilateral auditory dysfunction and it is important to monitor hearing in both ears.(21) After hearing is determined to be stable, annual audiograms are recommended. Management of recurrent otitis media and chronic otitis media with effusion will minimize the effects of a conductive loss(8) Patient/Family Education",
