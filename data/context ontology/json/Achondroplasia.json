Although there were minor complications associated with the procedure (i.e., pintract  infections, transient radial nerve palsy), the consensus was that patients were more satisfied after these complications resolved (9) Other studies have shown that humeral elongation procedures can provide significant improvements in patient autonomy with low complication rates (11) Patients who have undergone femoral lengthening procedures are likely to present with complications associated with hip flexion contractures (12) A multidisciplinary team of skilled clinicians who specialize in evaluating and treating achondroplasia should be involved in the routine monitoring and management of patients with this condition (15,17) Tympanostomy tubes and adenotonsillectomy are recommended by consensus for children with chronic recurrent otitis media(3) Rationale is to reduce the risk of conductive hearing loss, since recurrent otitis media occurs in 25% of infants(3) Patients with otitis media should be given a 2-week  course of intravenous antibiotic treatment (10) There are several significant orthopedic and/or neurological conditions that develop over a child\u2019s lifespan.

Intraoperative ultrasound, which shows pulsatility at the upper cervical spine, can be used to confirm that the decompression is adequate Duraplasty (surgical closure of the open dura mater) is performed as indicated Thoracolumbar kyphosis(3) Thoracolumbar kyphosis surgical correction is not limited to children Spinal stenosis External fixators and osteotomies are now the standard technique for limb lengthening to improve independent functional lifestyle (15) Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) might need to be considered if signs or symptoms persist after surgical intervention (15)",
