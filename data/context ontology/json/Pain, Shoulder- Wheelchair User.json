            "The typical shoulder lesions that plague wheelchair users are rotator cuff tears and chronic subacromial impingement, although other surrounding soft tissues (contractile or noncontractile) within the shoulder complex are susceptible to injury as well",
            "In MRI findings from a 2014 study, the authors demonstrated tendon tears in 70% of manual wheelchair users with anterolateral shoulder pain. Ninety percent of the rotator cuff tears occurred at the insertion site. Most tears were in the supraspinatus tendon. Additional findings were acromioclavicular joint edema, degenerative arthrosis, and coracoacromial ligament thickening(8)"

            "Manual wheelchair users must utilize their upper extremities for wheelchair propulsion and transfers. They use their upper extremities to impart a force onto the wheelchair pushrim in order to move. This subjects the shoulder to weight-bearing  loads, making it susceptible to pathologies (e.g., subacromial impingement, tendinopathies, bursitis)(8)",
            "The reported incidence of shoulder pain among wheelchair users with spinal cord injury (SCI) is up to 86%, with a reported prevalence of 43% 5 years post discharge from inpatient rehabilitation(13)",
            "Common shoulder lesions in wheelchair users are chronic subacromial impingement and rotator cuff tears.(8)The supraspinatus tendon is the tendon most commonly torn.(8) Other common injuries include subacromial bursitis and labral tears(8)",
            "Shoulder pain in these individuals can prove especially detrimental if a wheelchair is the primary mode of mobility. Conservative options are the first choice for overuse injuries. When surgery is necessary, limited independence is a major drawback as typical postoperative protocols require resting the repaired shoulder for at least 6 weeks(14)"

            "Exercise efficacy \u2013Authors of a 2015 systematic review concluded that exercise is a feasible, conservative, therapeutic intervention for the treatment of shoulder pain among MWUs with SCI(12) -Based on 3 RCTs and 4 cohort studies -Interventions evaluated were arm ergometry, resistive strengthening with or without electromyographic biofeedback, and stretching targeted muscles -Studies are still needed to differentiate techniques, to determine the most effective duration of intervention, and to estimate the magnitude of the effect associated with therapeutic exercise \u2013Therapeutic exercise reduces shoulder pain in patients who use wheelchairs as their primary mode of locomotion  -Based on a research study in India that included 30 patients with paraplegia and shoulder pain who participated in a scapular strengthening program6 days a week for 8 weeks(9) -Patients had a significant reduction in shoulder pain following treatment as indicated by WUSPI scores \u2013High-dose  scapular stabilizing and rotator cuff strengthening using telerehabilitation improves shoulder pain in MWU with SCI(21) -Each participant performed 12 weeks of a home exercise program which included rotator cuff and scapular stabilization exercises -Exercises were supervised by a physical therapist via videoconferencing and performed 3 times a week, with 3 sets of 30 repetitions -Additional studies are needed to compare the effectiveness of this program to that of other interventions as well as to explore the potential for earlier intervention to prevent shoulder pain .
