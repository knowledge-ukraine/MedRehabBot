            "Language disorders in preschool children can be developmental (present from birth) or acquired (resulting from injury or disease following some period of typical language development). A child with a primary language disorder experiences difficulties mainly in the acquisition or use of language. A child with a secondary language disorder presents with language difficulties associated with a separate primary condition (e.g., hearing loss, head injury).(2) Language disorders in early childhood often result from a combination of biological and environmental factors. For example, the effects of prematurity could be compounded if that child is in a neglectful, unresponsive home environment.(3) For typically developing children, \u201cpreschool age\u201d refers to 2 years to 5 years of age.(4) However, some older children with language and/or other delays function at this level and will display the same characteristics as younger, typically developing children. Language skills that correspond to those displayed by typically developing preschool-aged  children have also been termed \u201cdeveloping language\u201d skills. Children in the developing language stage have expressive vocabularies of more than 50 words and make sentences by combining words; however, their use of grammar often is incorrect and they are still learning basic sentence structure. If a child is chronologically between 2 years and 5 years of age, but displays delayed language skills, he or she might still be in the prelinguistic stage or the emerging language stage. Children in the prelinguistic stage of development have begun to communicate intentionally through the use of gesture and vocalization; however, they do not yet use conventional language (e.g., words). During the emerging language period, children begin using single words, two-word  combinations, and simple sentences(4)"

            "During the preschool period, intervention may be carried out by a variety or combination of persons: SLPs, paraprofessionals (following the guidelines of the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association), parents, carefully selected peers or siblings who are supported and trained by an SLP, and/or the child\u2019s classroom teacher with support/ training provided by an SLP(4,35)",
            "Several models of service delivery exist that can be used when working with a preschool child with a language delay/ disorder: clinical model (child is seen either individually or in a small group in a specialized setting), language-based classrooms, collaborative model (the SLP provides intervention within the child\u2019s mainstream classroom), and consultant model (the SLP trains the child\u2019s teacher and/or parents in ways to modify classroom or daily activities to address the child\u2019s language needs).(4)Multitiered systems of supports (MTSS) are models for reading intervention with three different levels of support. Tier 1 involves whole-classroom instruction with screenings at various intervals to determine which children would benefit from additional support. In tier 2, children who are not making the expected progress are given small-group instruction; if additional support is necessary, tier 3 involves 1:1 instruction.(51) Examples of MTSS models of intervention are the Response to Intervention (RTI) and the Embedded-Explicit Model of Intervention \u2013RTI -RTI principles(36) -Tiered instruction that is dependent on the individual needs of the child being served. Tiers vary according to level, frequency, and intensity of instruction -High-quality  instruction (involving knowledgeable professionals, varied instructional methods, ongoing assessment, matching experiences to child\u2019s needs, and professional collaboration) -Research-based  core curriculum -Data collection to monitor student progress and instructional effectiveness coupled with attempts to understand a child\u2019s current performance -Evidence-based  interventions -Instructional practices are selected and revised based upon set procedures (e.g., collaborating with the child\u2019s family, consideration of the child\u2019s needs and learning context) -Adherence to RTI principles is monitored -In order to work in early childhood settings that incorporate RTI, an SLP will need to:(37) -Gain additional training on the principles and implementation of RTI -Identify and provide preventive services to children at risk for language and learning difficulties -Spend more work time in a consultative role and in the mainstream classroom -For detailed information on RTI, see Clinical Review\u2026Response to Intervention (RTI) ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T709175 \u2013Embedded-Explicit  Model of Intervention(6) -Incorporates three best practice parameters -Response-to-Treatment  Model (discussed above as RTI) -Collaboration between the SLP and classroom teacher, which may include \u201cco-teaching\u201d  during the first tier of intervention and explicit teaching of preliteracy and literacy skills by the SLP in the second tier of intervention -Supportive techniques -Use of intermediate targets: targets that the child may reach given adult support but not independently -Contextual manipulation: the child should be exposed to intervention goals in a variety of contexts -Dynamic assessment: the child\u2019s performance is continuously assessed, especially the level of support he or she requires to perform targeted activities -Cycled targets: a child works on multiple goals concurrently \u2013 one skill does not need to be mastered before addressing another skill; this allows the child to integrate targeted skills over time -Emphasizes the following literacy domains: -Phonological awareness -Print concepts  -Alphabet knowledge and writing -Narrative and literate language -Organizes the classroom -Literacy learning opportunities are embedded throughout the class day -All children receive large-group,  first-tier literacy instruction -Additional explicit, small-group  instruction is provided to children who do not respond to first-tier  instruction \u2013Authors of a study conducted in the United States with a cluster randomized design that included 104 preschool-age children in 39 classrooms using MTSS assessed the effectiveness of an additional phonemic awareness curriculum, PAth to Literacy, as tier 2 instruction. All of the children included in the study had been previously identified as needing tier 2 level instruction due to difficulty meeting whole-classroom  benchmarks. Half of the children-teacher groups were assigned to participate in PAth to Literacy and half were assigned to the control condition, Story Friends. PAth to Literacy involves 36 daily, scripted 10-minute  lessons with collaborative activities designed to teach phonemic awareness and alphabet knowledge. Story Friends, the control condition, uses the small-group  format to teach vocabulary skills. At the conclusion of the study, outcome measures indicated greater gains on the DIBELS first sound fluency and word parts fluency subtests for the PAth to Literacy group compared to the Story Friends group. These two subtests are associated with kindergarten readiness. All outcome measures indicated that phonemic awareness was learned best from the PAth to Literacy program as compared to vocabulary instruction(51)",
            "Shared-reading  intervention \u2013Several studies have been conducted that point to the benefits of shared-reading  intervention for preschool-aged children with language delays/disorders.(38,39) Shared-reading  activities are book-centered  activities in which the child and adult work together to construct meaning from the book to which they are attending.(6) Shared-reading  is believed to be beneficial because: -Shared-reading  and exposure to literature enhance a child\u2019s vocabulary development(40) -Shared-reading  activities offer contextual support (i.e., a book or familiar story), which allows the adult to use more complex language and supports the development of the child\u2019s abstract language skills(38,40) -Oral language development and early literacy skills are interrelated and reciprocal(38) -Reading books is a natural activity for many American families and therefore allows intervention activities to be conducted in a naturalistic environment(41) -Providing intervention services during shared-book reading can strengthen the foundation upon which later literacy skills are built(41) \u2013Authors of a study conducted in the United States with 27 kindergarten students with specific language impairment examined the effects of an interactive book reading intervention on language abilities and phonological processing. The goal of the study was to determine the most effective number of sessions. Children in this study received 12, 24, 36, or 48 exposures to the target words in the selected books through interactive book reading sessions; researchers found that the optimal number of exposures was 36. There did not appear to be additional benefits from 48 exposures(52) \u2013Despite the benefits of incorporating shared-reading  into a treatment program for language delays and disorders, prior to including these activities in a treatment plan SLPs should consider an individual child\u2019s/families perception of shared-reading  activities, the child\u2019s motivation and desire to participate in book-related  activities, the effect (possibly negative) of changing a parent-child\u2019s  interaction style, and ways to address goals in contexts other than shared-book reading to encourage the generalization of targeted skills(41)",
            "Learning Connections (LC): LC is an emerging literacy and mathematics curriculum developed for preschool children (aged 3\u20135 years) that focuses on oral language skills, phonemic awareness, alphabet knowledge, print concepts, and emergent writing. A study of children enrolled in a Head Start program divided 126 children into three groups: experimental literacy (classrooms implementing the LC curriculum), experimental math, or control (classrooms continued to implement current Head Start curriculum). Following 11 months of instruction, children in the experimental literacy classrooms displayed significantly better performance in the areas of phonemic awareness and emergent writing and somewhat better performance in emergent reading. These results support the practice of teaching several literacy skills concurrently and of teaching early literacy skills in an explicit, intentional manner(42) ",
            "Home-based  preliteracy programs \u2013In a study conducted in the United States, researchers examined the effects of a home-based  phonological awareness intervention program that included 13 mother-child  dyads comprising mothers and their 4-year-old  children in whom specific language impairment previously was diagnosed(43) -The program was a 12-week,  home-based  book reading intervention(43) -The dyads were randomly assigned to one of three groups: one targeting print skills (e.g., letter recognition), one targeting phonological awareness, and another in which mothers were instructed to ask questions about the stories read(43) -Prior to the start of the study the mothers each completed a questionnaire to document home literacy practices(43) -The mothers all received 12 storybooks, a tape recorder, and 6 audiotapes; the mothers were asked to read each book at home 4 times per week while recording these sessions. The tapes were returned to researchers every 2 weeks(43) -If the mothers were not completing each task as described in the home program materials, researchers completed telephone calls to ask and answer questions regarding the protocol(43) -For those dyads included in the phonological awareness intervention program, the storybooks each included 9 questions throughout the text that related to the story and focused on different aspects of phonological awareness (either rhyme, beginning sounds, or word segmentation at the syllable level)(43) -The mothers had been given a list of suggestions meant to help facilitate the children\u2019s performance on each task (e.g., pause for response, praise the child, etc.)(43) -The Phonological Awareness Literacy Screening (PALS-PreK)  was used as an outcome measure, measuring the children\u2019s rhyme awareness before and after the intervention program(43) -The children who completed the phonological awareness intervention program in this study started with an average score of 4.0; scores increased to an average of 6.08 within 2 weeks of completing the 12-week  program(43) -Additionally, researchers examined the quality of the mothers\u2019 interactions and scored them with respect to concept development (how well the mothers were able to support the children in learning the new concepts associated with phonological awareness). Over the course of the 12-week  program, the mothers\u2019 scores, on average, declined 0.05 points per week, with an overall decline of 0.55 (equal to half a unit of support on the rating scale used)(43) -Possible explanations for the decline in concept development scores in the mothers included initial excitement about the program that decreased over time and the possibility that the mothers were not enforcing the correct concepts because they themselves did not understand the process by which children learn to read (i.e., phonological awareness concepts)(43) -Although the mothers declined in their average concept development scores, they were successful in implementing the program 91% of the time throughout the 12 weeks. Researchers in this study recommended the use of home-based phonological awareness programs for children with language impairment to prevent later reading disabilities; however, they also stated that parents themselves would require more support and education regarding the underlying goal of the program in order for the children to receive the greatest benefit(43) \u2013Researchers in the United States conducted another study of a 12-week  home-based  storybook intervention program using the same general format as described above with 62 parent-child dyads focused on print concepts and alphabet knowledge including letter recognition and sound-to-letter  pairs; however, in this program there was a 25% dropout rate, with parents reporting that the program was too intense and not feasible(44) -For those children who did complete the treatment program, print-concept  knowledge was significantly higher in the treatment condition (those children who were asked questions about print concepts, letters, and/or words throughout the reading of the story) versus those children in picture-  or sound-focused  conditions(44) \u2013In a study conducted in Italy in which researchers specifically examined the quality of mother\u2019s repair strategies (when the parent corrects a child\u2019s mistake or incorrect language production) in book-reading  tasks found that mothers of children with specific language impairment produced significantly more highly supportive repairs than mothers of age-matched  typically developing peers; however, when the children were matched based on MLU or linguistic development (rather than age), the mothers of children with language impairment and typically developing children produced the same quantity of high repairs(45) -These findings suggest that mothers match the level of support to the child\u2019s level of language competence(45)  -Researchers in this study recommended continued education about appropriate repair strategies of the parents of children with language impairment in order to give the child the greatest benefit from all reading and linguistic activities in the home(45)",
            "Effects of instruction on children at risk for reading deficits: In a study conducted in the United States of 169 children (101 grouped as \u201cat risk for reading deficits\u201d with a mean age of 54.6 months at initial testing, 68 grouped as \u201cnot at risk\u201d with a mean age of 55.5 months at initial testing), children received intervention focusing on phoneme identity and structured reading. In structured reading, an adult and child engage in a dialogue about what they are reading, the child is questioned about the story, and he or she is asked to relate it to his or her own experience. Although both groups showed significant improvements in phonological awareness at the segment and rhyme level, familiarity with books and print, and receptive vocabulary, the children in the at-risk  group required more teaching sessions(12) .
