            "A total hip replacement (THR) is indicated when medications, changes in activities, and ambulation aids are no longer effective in decreasing hip pain and stiffness secondary to disease, injury, or fracture.(2) The purpose of a THR is to restore joint motion and alleviate pain.(3) For most patients, a THR is an effective procedure that will significantly improve functional status (1,3)",
            "A THR involves removing the hip joint and replacing it with an implant \u2013THR components include a femoral stem, a femoral neck, a femoral head, and an acetabular shell or cup with a polyethylene liner(2) \u2013The two most common approaches used during a THR are posterolateral or anterolateral(2) \u2013There are also direct lateral, transtrochanteric and minimally invasive approaches(22)",
            "The two most common fixation techniques for a THR are cemented and cementless (press fit)(2) \u2013Cemented technique is used only on the femoralcomponent(2) \u2013Patients who have had the press fit prosthesis will have limited weight-bearing status for 6 to 8 weeks post-surgery;  when the cemented technique is used, weight-bearing  is often allowed immediately, as tolerated(2) \u2013Press fit allows for more ROM; typically used in younger, more active patients(2)",
            "Currently, minimally invasive surgical techniques for the posterolateral approach are being utilized by orthopedic surgeons for appropriate patients; they result in reduced trauma to the soft tissue and faster recovery times(3,19,20) \u2013Hospitalization is typically 3 to 6 days \u2013Generally healthy patients who undergo THR may be \u201cfast tracked\u201d to be discharged in 2 days compared with the standard 3 to 6 days (23) or application of equipment .

        "Patients with weak periarticular tissues, revision surgeries, and/or previous dislocations are at highest risk for dislocation; dislocations occur with the greatest frequency during the first postoperative week.(2)  These patients may present with a brace for stability; strictly adhere to physician orders for mobility and brace use",
        "Traditional postoperative dislocation prevention involves using hip precautions for 6 to 12 weeks. Use of hip precautions varies with local policies and protocols.(16) There is uncertainty about whether precautions are essential. A lack of robust research supporting use of precautions has been noted(16)",
        "Results of a study conducted in the United Kingdom suggest that nonuse of hip precautions does not influence dislocation rate(16) A review of a change in service provision that differed from standard practice was undertaken All patients who received THR, revision hip replacement, or hemiarthroplasty between April and October 2013 were included in the service evaluation \u2013Data were analyzed from 80 elective and 20 trauma patients. 97.5% of the elective patients and 95% of the trauma patients did not use hip precautions \u2013After 12 weeks a structured telephone interview was conducted by the occupational therapists (OTs) \u2013Two dislocations (2%) were reported, which is lower than the 3.4% rate that has been reported in large multicenter audits",
        "General hip precautions for the patient in the first 6 to 8 weeks after THR include:(1,3) Follow physician orders Avoid extreme internal and external rotation of the hip Avoid hip adduction; use wedge pillow to maintain abduction Do not cross the legs, knees, or ankles Do not lie down or roll on the affected side No hip flexion beyond 90\u02da; do not reach forward",
        "Hip precautions according to approach type Guidelines for posterolateral approach \u2013Positions of hip stability include flexion (not beyond 90\u02da), abduction, gentle external rotation(3) \u2013Avoid positions of hip instability, which include adduction, any internal rotation, hyperflexion beyond 90\u02da (2,3)  \u2013Authors of a 2020 systematic review of 7 studies with 6,900 (THR-  posterior approach) patients found no difference in dislocation rates following THRbetween those prescribed hip precautions and those which were not. The authors also found there was no difference in patient-reported  outcomes between these two groups (32) Guidelines for anterolateral approach \u2013Positions of hip stability include flexion (not beyond 90\u02da), abduction to neutral, gentle internal rotation(3) \u2013Avoid positions of hip instability, which include adduction, any external rotation, hyperextension(3) To understand the specific surgical technique used, the therapist should communicate with the surgeon and review the surgical report (22)",
        "Authors of a 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis  of the literature found that more liberal lifestyle restrictions and precautions post THR will not lead to increased dislocation rates, but will lead to earlier resumption of activities and higher patient satisfaction(24) Studies of THR procedures managed with different postoperative restrictions and precautions protocols were included. Primary outcome was dislocation rate, secondary outcomes were patient functioning, return to ADLs, and patient satisfaction A total of 6 studies were included: three RCTs, one retrospectivematched cohort study, one retrospective study, and one prospective cohort study, describing 1122 procedures (restrictions group: n =\u2009528; no restrictions group: n\u2009=\u2009594).

Subjects in the control group completed open chain exercises and were recommended to use an assistive device and partial weight-bearing  (PWB) until 3 months after surgery.
