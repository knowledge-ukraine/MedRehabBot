            "Dysphagia refers to difficulty swallowing due to an inability to move food efficiently during the oral, pharyngeal, or esophageal phases of swallowing.(2) The oral phase includes sucking, chewing, and moving the food or liquid into the throat while achieving adequate lip closure. The pharyngeal phase is the initiation of the swallowing reflex, when the food is squeezed down the throat and the airway is closed off to prevent aspiration (food or liquid entering the airway) or choking. In the esophageal phase, the openings at the top and bottom of the esophagus move the food or liquid to the stomach by relaxing and tightening.(2) The speech-language pathologist (SLP) is primarily involved in the treatment and assessment of feeding and swallowing problems in infants who have PWS. Infants with PWS experience oral phase difficulties due to hypotonia of the tongue and oral cavity(4)",

A VFSS is completed in collaboration with a physician (radiologist or physiatrist).(7) The assessment must be age-appropriate  with regard to positioning, presentation of food and liquid, and viscosity of material.(7) The patient eats and drinks a variety of developmentally appropriate liquids and solids mixed with barium while images are recorded with videofluorography. All patients should be examined in the lateral and frontal positions to gain information on movements of the swallow and symmetry of bolus flow and pharyngeal wall contraction. The SLP examines for the presence of aspiration and the effectiveness of presenting different food consistencies or of modifying posture.(7) In contrast to the CSE, VFSS provides critical information on the pharyngeal phase of the swallow.(17) Given the unnatural surroundings, swallowing function observed during a VFSS is not necessarily identical to that used at mealtimes.(18) Other variables that influence swallowing function include anxiety, fatigue, and medications.(16) Due to the harmful effects of ionizing radiation on children, a repeat VFSS should only be considered when there are specific questions that require answers from a repeat study; a VFSS should not be used frequently to monitor changes in swallowing(16) -In a study conducted in the United States of 23 VFSS studies performed with 10 infants with PWS (many infants underwent multiple VFSSs), researchers found a high incidence of dysphagia. Nine of the infants exhibited aspiration during at least one of the VFSSs; aspiration occurred in 87% of the VFSSs conducted and pharyngeal residue was present in 71%. Every instance of aspiration observed in these 23 VFSS studies was silent. Researchers highly recommended evaluating infants with PWS with a VFSS or other instrumental evaluation of swallowing rather than a CSE alone(38)(16) -Lip closure (ability to contain a liquid bolus) -Lingual elevation (the back of the tongue should be slightly elevated) -Tongue-to-palatal  seal -Bolus preparation/mastication -Bolus transport/movement of the tongue (movement of the bolus to the back of the oral cavity)  -Initiation of the pharyngeal swallow (swallow should be initiated when the bolus reaches the region of the posterior oral cavity) -Soft palate elevation and retraction -Laryngeal elevation -Anterior hyoid excursion -Laryngeal closure -Pharyngeal contraction -Pharyngoesophageal segment opening -Tongue base retraction -Epiglottic inversion -Esophageal clearanceModifiedT709077A FEES is performed to evaluate the anatomy and physiology of the pharynx and the larynx, pharyngeal swallow function, and the patient\u2019s ability to manage secretions and swallow foods and liquids.(7) In addition, it can be used to explore a variety of diagnostic interventions, such as varying bolus consistency, varying posture, or making use of visual feedback for reinforcement.(19) After the insertion of the endoscope, the patient can engage in normal feeding behavior during the evaluation. Food must be light in color to enhance visibility (e.g., milk, puddings, yogurt, bread). A FEES is sometimes preferred over VFSS when patients have safety issues related to radiation exposure or when they need frequent retesting. Due to the invasive nature of the procedure, it can be difficult to obtain accurate representation of a normal swallow in young children -For detailed information on endoscopic assessment of swallowing, see the series of Clinical Reviews on this topicInfant sucking and oral transit times can be examined by ultrasonography, an instrumental procedure involving transducers that use high-frequency  sound waves to create images. In infants and children, the transducer is placed under the chin as the patient swallows liquid or food. The ultrasonographic scanner can display images of the nipple, tongue surface, hard and soft palates, and hyoid during infant feeding(7)",

            "Nipple selection for bottle-feeding:  Adaptive bottles and specialized bottle nipples are often used to slow the flow of liquid or change the way in which liquid is delivered into the oral cavity for infants with PWS.(35) Nipple characteristics such as the shape or material of the nipple and size of the hole can be selected to influence fluid flow; however, there is little evidence to support the use of a particular type of nipple to improve bottle-feeding performance in preterm infants. Nipples are often selected based upon personal preference and clinical experience",

These immature sucking patterns can lead to coughing, choking, bradycardia, apnea, and fatigue during feeding. Paced feeding involves removing the nipple from the mouth after every three to five sucks to encourage 3- to 5-second breathing pauses",
            "Feeding schedules: The two primary options for feeding schedules are responsive feeding (feeding an infant based on his or her behaviors that indicate hunger and satiation) and scheduled interval feeding (infant is fed at scheduled times). Authors of a systematic review that included 9 RCTs compared the effects of both types of feeding schedules for preterm infants and determined that there are insufficient data at present to guide clinical practice. There is some indication that responsive feeding with preterm infants leads to full oral feeding (i.e., no need for tube feed supplementation) more quickly than interval feeding; however, larger, better designed trials are necessary to confirm this finding(20)",
            "Oral sensory motor therapy/oral stimulation:  Oral and facial stimulation in preterm infants through use of auditory, tactile, visual, and vestibular intervention is associated with faster transition to oral feeding, reduced length of hospital stay, and improved weight gains(3,8)",

            "Nonnutritive sucking:  NNS refers to pacifier sucking. The objective for NNS is to assist the infant to develop coordinated sucking behaviors in preparation for oral feeding \u2013The authors of a systematic review examined 12 studies to determine the effects of NNS on major clinical variables for preterm infants: length of hospital stay, transition to bottle-feeding,  bottle-feeding  performance, weight gain, energy intake, heart rate, oxygen saturation, intestinal transit time, age at full oral feeds, and behavioral state.(21) The reviewers concluded that NNS led to a significantly decreased duration of hospital stay, reduced time for transition from gavage to full oral feeding, and reduced time for transition from start of oral feeding to full oral feeding. There was no consistent benefit on other clinical variables(21)",

Even while tube feeding is required, most patients with PWS continue to receive oral feedings as a supplemental nutritional source or as swallow rehabilitation. Authors of a Cochrane systematic review examined three trials comparing the use of nasogastric tubes vs. orogastric tubes for preterm infants and found that there was no evidence to support the use of one over the other or to guide clinical practice(37)",

An abrupt introduction of the bottle and movement of the tongue away from the palate can destabilize and disorganize the infant. Before feeding, prepare the infant by gently and slowly rubbing the nipple or a finger on the infant\u2019s lips. As the infant opens his or her mouth, move the bottle or finger inward, toward the gums, to signal that it is time to eat.
