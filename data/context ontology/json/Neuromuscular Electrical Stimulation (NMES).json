The goal of this external activation is to reduce impairment and improve voluntary function -During NMES, pulsed current is applied through an electrode to the motor point of innervated muscles to produce muscle contractions -The characteristics of the applied current can be adjusted according to the presenting condition and therapeutic goals -It can be used for muscle strengthening, increasing ROM, and facilitating muscle contractions for enhancing motor control and improving function (see Indications and Guidelines for use , below) -A unique feature of NMES is that it elicits recruitment of motor neurons that is less orderly than in voluntary exercise, favoring activation of large, type II, higher-force-producing  motor units at relatively low levels of stimulation(40) -In voluntary exercise,a greater intensity is required to activate these larger motor units(45) \u2013FES \u2013 functional electrical stimulation \u2013 use of electrical stimulation of the peripheral nervous system to activate muscles to assist in functional activities (might also be referred to as FNS \u2013 functional neuromuscular stimulation). FES is a type of NMES. For more information about FES, please see  Clinical Review\u2026Functional Electrical Stimulation: Adults  ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T708953 -When the goal of the stimulation is to produce purposeful movements, it is usually referred to as FES. The long-term  management of these movements will require ongoing electrical stimulation(1) \u2013ES \u2013 electrical stimulation \u2013EMS \u2013 electrical muscle stimulation \u2013 use of electrical stimulation to activate muscles directly, without activation of the peripheral nerve (e.g., to activate denervated muscle).EMS parameters are significantly different than for NMES \u2013TENS \u2013 transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation \u2013 use of electrical stimulation for the relief or management of pain.

Some devices have fixed pulsedurations and some have a limited range of durations (e.g., 20\u2013500  \u00b5s(56))\u2013Although short pulse durations are thought less likely to recruit nociceptors, the results of a study in the United Statescomparing maximum tolerated muscle torques produced by different pulse durations support the use of a medium pulseduration rather than a short pulse duration to produce maximum torque(6)-The goal for strengthening with NMES is to produce the highest forces possible to produce the largest and most rapidstrength gains-Participants in this study tolerated significantly greater muscle torques produced by stimulation with 200 \u03bcs pulsedurations than with 50 \u03bcs pulse durations\u2013An observational substudy of an RCT conducted in the United States that included only patients who received NMESfound that higher electrical intensities are associated with greater quadriceps muscle strength and activation after totalknee arthroplasty (TKA)(40)",

The study included 20healthy individuals and utilized ultrasound to measure changes in muscle thickness of the transverse abdominis,obliquus internus, and obliquus externus(54)\u2013Higher frequency can lead to more rapid fatigue.

Outcome measures included the TUG test, stair climbing test, and walk tests -Patients in the group receiving NMES had better scores in the first postoperative weeks, but the benefits of NMES diminished overtime -The authors concluded that NMES after TKA is easy and safe to apply, and results in faster functional recovery in the immediate postoperative period -The heterogeneity of rehabilitation protocols, including NMES settings and the start time, duration, and frequency of treatment, was a limiting factor in the meta-analysis -In a meta-analysis  completed in 2018, researchers found that patients receiving NMES after TKA had improved scores on the TUG, stair climbing test, and 6MWTrelative to patients not receiving NMES(74) -Benefits from NMES were greatest in the early postoperative stages of recovery.There was no difference between groups in medium-  to long-term stages -Researchers who conducted a study in the United States found that NMES might be useful to treat muscle atrophy and weakness in patients with RA(18) -NMES and a volitional exercise training protocol were evaluated for quadriceps strengthening in patients with RA in a multiple-patient  case report -Patients who completed the protocol increased their lean muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical function -Neither the effects of NMES alone nor those of exercise alone were compared to the effects of combining NMES with exercise -Protocol was not well-tolerated  or adhered to by some patients with RA -An NMES training protocol can be a useful treatment adjunct following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) repair(16,17) -Investigators in a prospective randomized clinical trial conducted in the United States of electrical stimulation for quadriceps strengthening and functional recovery after ACL reconstruction found that there was greater quadriceps strength recovery in patients who received high-intensity  electrical stimulation versus patients who received only low-intensity electrical stimulation or volitional exercise(16) -Authors of an RCT conducted in the United States (N = 43) examined the effectiveness of a modified NMES protocol in addition to standard rehabilitation(17) -NMES was applied with the patients lying supine with the knees fully extended -The NMES group demonstrated greater quadriceps strength than the control group after 12 weeks of treatment -The effectiveness of NMES appears proportional to the dose; the larger the dose, the greater the therapeutic effects.(48)In a study conducted in the United States, researchers identified factors that contribute to the ability of patients with RA to tolerate high doses of NMES(48) -Each participant (n = 40) had a diagnosis of RA and participants received 2 sessions of NMES to the quadriceps -The dose was calculated as the amount of torque resulting from the application of NMES and this value was compared to the torque measured from a maximal voluntary isometric contraction -Correlations between NMES and disability, pain coping strategies, pain acceptance, sense of mastery or control, anxiety, and depression were investigated. Outcome measures included the following: -Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) -Coping Strategies Questionnaire (CSQ) -Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire (CPAQ) -Sense of Mastery Scale (SMA) -Center for Epidemiological Studies Short Depression Scale (CESD) -Anxiety Inventory Form (AI) -Disability, catastrophizing, coping self-statements,  and anxiety were predictors of the maximum dose tolerated with NMES -Patients who had lower catastrophizing, evidenced by lower scores on a subset of the CSQ, and lower levels of disability were able to achieve higher doses  -NMES did not improve quadriceps muscle strength and activation in women with radiographic evidence of early knee osteoarthritis in an RCT conducted in the United States(19) -Thirty women with mild-moderate  knee osteoarthritis were included in the study. Participants were randomized into two groups: no treatment or NMES 3 times per week for 4 weeks -Patients with a history of knee surgery or ligamentous knee injury were excluded -NMES targeted the quadriceps muscles; each treatment session included 10 stimulation-induced contractions with the intensity of current set to the maximum tolerated. A target intensity of at least 35% of the maximum voluntary isometric contraction was encouraged -Similar protocols have been used for post anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and TKA intervention and have a history of effectiveness for these populations. It is possible the dosage was insufficient for improving quadriceps strength and activation in early knee osteoarthritis. The dose-response  relationship is not determined in this population -Investigators in Switzerland report that NMES of the intrinsic foot muscles enhances their function as medial longitudinal arch stabilizers and can be used to alter foot plantar pressure patterns and improve dynamic control to reduce breakdown(50) -NMES treatment is typically performed over a 3 to 5 week period and includes an average of 9 to 12 sessions with a gradual progression of active modeling in combination with functional integration activities (e.g., single limb squatting) -Authors of an RCT published in 2019 concluded that NMES was effective in reducing edema post ankle sprain (grade I and II), as measured by fluid displacement(75) -The control group consisted of patients receiving the current standard of care for ankle sprain and the intervention group received NMES as an adjunct to the current standard of care -There were no between-group  differencesin figure 8 measurement, pain scores, or functional scores -Researchers of a 2019 systematic review found that NMES is effective in various rehabilitation settings and patient groups to reduce edema(76) -Given the limited number of trials available (8 total), the researchers advocated for further trials to reinforce these findings \u2013Stroke -NMES might be used to enable active practice when the severity of motor and sensory deficits limits or prevents active practice. Following a stroke, NMES has been reported to improve ROMand force production and to reduce hypertonicity.(78)NMES might be useful for reducing shoulder subluxation and pain and there is also evidence that NMES facilitates motor relearning of the upper and lower extremities(20) -Authors of a meta-analysis  of studies evaluating the effectiveness of NMES for management of shoulder subluxation post-stroke  found a beneficial effect in individuals with acute and subacute stroke, but no significant benefits for individuals with chronic stroke(64) -The effectiveness of short (1 hour or less) and long (greater than 1 hour) daily treatment durations was examined -Eleven studies were included with a total of 432 participants -In patients with acute and subacute stroke, there was a significant treatment effect for reduction of subluxation with short or long daily treatment durations -Effective parameters included frequency of 10\u201336  pps, pulse duration 200\u2013250  \u00b5s, and treatment 3 to 7 times per week for 4 to 8 weeks -There was no significant treatment effect for patients with chronic stroke (greater than 6 months) -There was no significant treatment effect on arm function or shoulder pain -NMES during task-oriented  exercise can be used to produce or augment contractions in paretic muscles(20,21) -EMG triggered NMES is produced when an individual voluntarily attempts to move and the EMG corresponds by triggering the NMES. For example, as poststroke patients attempt to extend their wrist and fingers, the EMG-triggered stimulation assists the movement, and full extension is experienced -In a 2000 RCT in the United States (N = 11), investigators found that EMG-triggered  NMES to the wrist and finger extensors of individuals with chronic hemiparesis due to stroke resulted in significant improvements in grasping small objects and sustaining contractions(22) -In 2008, a systematic review of RCTs of EMG-triggered  neuromuscular stimulation of the wrist and finger extensors after stroke found no statistically significant differences compared to usual care(23)  -Eight studies (N = 157) met criteria for meta-analysis -Meta-analysis  did not find significant effect sizes in sustained contraction, reaction time, or dexterity -Most of the studies were restricted to chronic or subacute phases after stroke \u2013 only one was within 3 weeks poststroke -These findings were incongruous with those of a 2004 meta-analysis  which found a significant overall effect of EMG-triggered  NMES on the recovery of arm/hand function after stroke(51) -One difference was that nonrandomized controlled trials were included in the 2004 study(51) -EMG-triggered  NMES as an adjunct to constraint-induced  movement therapy (CIMT) was reported to be feasible and beneficial in a casestudy in the United States(24) -Individuals not capable of extending their wrists and fingers are excluded from CIMT protocols -Use of EMG-triggered  NMES enabled clients to follow the CIMT protocol -EMG-triggered  NMES to the affected tibialis anterior muscle can increase active ROM and improve aspects of balance and gait, accordingto authors of a case study conducted in the United States(11) -In a single subject 16 months poststroke, the impact of low-dose,  EMG-triggered  stimulation on gait and balance was evaluated -Improvements in active ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion and in BBS score were seen at a relatively low dose of treatment (20 minutes/day for 4 weeks) -Researchers in China found that use of an electromyographic bridge (EMGB) augmented the recovery of volitional wrist and finger motion in post-stroke  patients better than cyclic NMES did(65) -EMGB differs from EMG-triggered  NMES in that the EMG is recorded from the contralateral arm. Since EMG-triggered  NMES requires some volitional movements in the affected arm to acquire trigger signals, it is often not applicable to severely paralyzed patients, especially during the early phase of rehabilitation post-stroke.  EMGB is a novel system that uses bimanual movements -In an RCT, 42 acute or subacute hemiplegic patients were assigned to 4-week  treatments with EMGB or cyclic NMES. Each group did10 sessions per week of hand training with EMGB or cyclic NMES -Outcome measures included Brunnstrom stage, upper extremity components of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment, Motor Status Scale, voluntary surface EMG ratio, and active ROM of wrist and fingers -The EMGB group showed significantly greater improvements than the cyclic NMES group on the Brunnstrom scale, Fugl-Meyer  Assessment, Motor Status Scale, and the voluntary surface EMG ratio of wrist and finger extensors -In a 2019 systematic review and meta-analysisinvestigators  found that EMG-NMES  had a strong short-term  effect on the ICF domain of body structure and function in the upper limb for patient post stroke(77) -There were no improvements found in favor of EMG-NMES  for the activity and participation domains -The strongest effect for EMG-NMES  was seen in chronic (\u22653 months) phases more so than acute and subacute -Because it induces muscle contractions,NMES is a useful tool for gait training.In post-stroke patients with persistent gait deficitsNMES encourages a more normalized and coordinated gait pattern than can be achieved with volitional effort alone(25) -In an RCT conducted in the United States, researchers investigated the effect of gait training, coordination exercise, and weight-supported  treadmill training as isolated interventions as well as in conjunction with intramuscular functional neuromuscular stimulation(26) -Participants included 32 individuals longer than1 year poststroke -Intramuscular functional neuromuscular stimulation produced significantly greater gains for gait component execution (Tinetti gait scale) and knee flexion coordination -Electrodes were placed on eight muscles: tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, lateral head gastrocnemius, short head biceps femoris, semimembranosus, long head biceps femoris, vastuslateralis, and gluteus medius. Stimulation patterns were provided in multiple combinations and timings by software -Multichannel NMES with implanted electrodes was found by researchers to be more advantageous for gait training than gait training alone -Full-movement  NMES as a method of generating up to full range of movement significantly improved active ankle dorsiflexion and reduced plantar flexion spasticity in patients post-stroke(55) -Seventy-two  adults with subacute post-stroke hemiplegia and plantar flexor spasticity participated in this RCT in China  -Participants were randomized to the NMES or control group. All participants also received conventional physical therapy which included ankle ROM and stretches and neurodevelopmental facilitation techniques -NMES participants received stimulation on the motor points of the digitorumlongus and extensor hallucis muscles 2 times daily, in 30-minute sessions, for 4 weeks -The full-movement  NMES group had significant improvement in ankle active dorsiflexion score and a significant reduction in Composite Spasticity Scale scores -Authors of a 2018 systematic review found that NMES improved lower extremity function, gait speed, balance, spasticity, and ROM in survivors of chronic stroke(78) -The primary outcome was defined as lower extremity function.Secondary outcomes included gait speed, Berg Balance Scale, TUG, 6MWT, Modified Ashworth Scale, and ROM -NMES has been advocated as an adjunct to swallowing therapy for pharyngeal dysphagia following stroke(27) -In an RCT conducted in Thailand involving 23 post-stroke  patients with persistent pharyngeal dysphagia, investigators found that NMES (12 participants) was significantly superior to rehabilitation swallowing therapy (11 participants)(27) -In a 2007 meta-analysis,  researchers who evaluated the efficacy of NMES in swallowing rehabilitation concluded that there was a small but statistically significant improvement in swallowing performance with the use of NMES(28) -Authors of a 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis  found insufficient evidence regarding the efficacy of NMES for swallowing disorders(79) -The pooled studies in this systematic review were rated low to very low quality -Results showeda large effect size for stimulation of the infrahyoid muscle group, but not the suprahyoid group. Combined suprahyoid and infrahyoid muscle groups had a large effect size -Combining NMES and SES might be an effective method to improve upper extremity function following stroke(29) -Investigators of a case study conducted in the United States found improvements, 5 years post-stroke,  in upper extremity function measured using the Stroke Rehabilitation Assessment of Movement, the Action Research Arm test, and patient self-reports -The study design did not separate the effects of NMES and SES -Authors of a 2019 systematic review found a possible positive effect on urinary incontinence in patients post stroke using electrical stimulation(80) -The studies included in the systematic review had small population sizes and there was variability in the type of electrical stimulation used \u2013Traumatic brain injury (TBI) -A combination of therapeutic modalitieswas more productive than a singular therapeutic intervention in increasing speed of recovery post TBI(81) -In a 2019 systematic review, these treatments included FES, electroacupuncture, biokinetics, hydrotherapy, and robotic rehabilitation -Recovery may not occur in the 6-month  time frame previously considered standard; lifelong treatment participation may be indicated \u2013Spinal cord injury -Inactivity secondary to spinal cord injury negatively impacts many body systems. NMES produces contraction of paralyzed muscles, which can promote muscle hypertrophy, endurance, and histochemical changes -Treadmill gait training with NMES can promote quadriceps hypertrophy and cardiorespiratory responses in quadriplegic patients(30,31) -Treadmill gait training with body weight support combined with NMES was examined in a controlled study of 15 complete quadriplegic patients conducted by researchers in Brazil(30) -Eight patients received gait training with NMES for 6 months, twice per week, and 7 received conventional physiotherapy(30) -MRI performed at baseline and at 6 months showed a significantly increased cross-sectional area of quadriceps muscles in the NMES group at posttest(30) -Detrimental cortical reorganization occurring after spinal cord injury might contribute to physical dysfunction  -Somatosensory stimulation from NMES used in conjunction with bimanual massed practice may stimulate cortical reorganization post cervical spinal cord injury. A single casestudy conducted in the United States described the following:(3) -Improvements were observed in sensory function, strength, and hand skills -As evidenced by testing using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), the cortical motor map of the biceps brachii shifted anteriorly and increased in size (a more posterior shift occurs in patients with SCI compared to those without SCI) -The result suggests that somatosensory stimulation might contribute to cortical reorganization, which is associated with improvements in function -In a 2018 systematic literature review examining the effectiveness of NMES for increasing voluntary strength in the partially paralyzed muscles of persons with SCI, the authors concluded that there is no strong evidence to support that NMES is superior to any other treatment strategies used to build strength in this population(66) -Five studies were included -Two studies found an increase in strength measured by peak force and manual muscle testing after an NMES protocol. The other 3 studies found no differences between groups that received NMES and controls \u2013Cerebral palsy -NMES has been advocated as an adjunct to a physical therapy program for children with cerebral palsy that emphasizes a task-specific  approach to motor learning(5) -NMES has been used to improve gait in children with cerebral palsy(32,33,34,35,36) -Authors of an RCT conducted in Scotland concluded that FES can be a practical treatment option to improve gait kinematics in children with cerebral palsy(33) -Fourteen children participated (7 FES, 7 control) -FES of ankle dorsiflexors significantly improved gait kinematics during stimulation -There was no long-term  effect of using FES for 8 weeks -In an RCT conducted in the United States authors assessed whether NMES or volitional exercise could increase muscle strength and walking speed in children with cerebral palsy(34) -Eleven children participated (6 NMES, 5 volitional strengthening) -NMES was applied with percutaneously implanted electrodes -Both groups trained quadriceps and triceps surae for 12 weeks -The NMES group demonstrated a greater increase in force production compared to the volitional exercise group -Only the NMES group demonstrated a greater increase in walking speed after training -Researchers investigated the effects of daily NMES assisted gait training on muscle strength and volume of children with unilateral spastic cerebral palsy(35) -Thirty-two  subjects with unilateral spastic cerebral palsy participated in this study in Australia -Participants were randomly assigned to receive daily NMES or conventional treatment for 8 weeks -At the completion of the 8-week  intervention, the NMES group had significantly increased muscle strength of the tibialis anterior, anterior compartment, lateral and medial gastrocnemius, and dorsiflexion compared to baseline measures and the control group -At a 14-week  follow-up,  the NMES group retained significant improvements in the tibialis anterior and lateral gastrocnemius volumes compared to baseline; also, the lateral gastrocnemius value remained significantly better than the control group -NMES to the tibialis anterior in children with spastic hemiparesis resulted in significant increases in strength, gross motor function, and passive ROM of ankle dorsiflexion. No significant differences were found between groups that received NMES once a week or twice a week(36) -Ten children participated; 5 received NMES twice per weekand 5 received NMES once per week -The study was single-blinded  and conducted in Brazil -The results seem to justify the use of NMES protocols once per week, which is arguably more feasible within the reality of physical therapy practice -Sensory-level  electrical stimulation might be a useful adjunct treatment to improve muscle contractions in children with cerebral palsy  -A nonrandomized, noncontrolled study conducted in Finland of sensory level stimulation applied to the tibialis anterior muscle showed significant improvements in foot and ankle movement(4) -Seventeen children participated -Movements included dorsiflexion, toe flexion and extension, and inversion and eversion -Improved active and passive range persisted for months after stimulation ceased -Authors of a 2019 systematic review found low-quality evidence to support the use of NMES as an adjunct treatment to improve sitting and standing dimensions of gross motor function in children with cerebral palsy(82) -6 RCTs were included in the meta-analysis -Improvements in gross motor function were measured using the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM) -Use of NMES to improve upper extremity function in cerebral palsy has been reported -Investigators in case studies conducted in the United States suggest that NMES might be a useful tool for improving muscle strength, sensory awareness, motor learning, and coordination(37,38) \u2013COPD, CHF -NMES of leg muscles has been used to decrease breathlessness and improve exercise capacity for patients with chronic lung disease(12,83) -A Cochrane systematic review of nonpharmacological interventions for breathlessness concluded there is a strong of evidence that NMES relieves breathlessness in COPD(12) -Three trials (N = 50) evaluated effects of NMES on breathlessness -NMES was applied to lower extremity muscles -Authors of a meta-analysis  in 2018 pooled data from 11 RCTs and found that NMES, when used to treat chronic respiratory disease, had a significant role in improving patients\u2019 exercise capacity(83) -Functional measures improved were 6-minute  walk distance and quadriceps strength.There was no improvement seen on the incremental shuttle walk test or endurance shuttle walk test -NMES of leg muscles improves exercise tolerance in patients being treated for advanced heart failure(67) -Based on a randomized controlled study conducted in Brazil -Seventy patients hospitalized for decompensated heart failure and receiving continuous intravenous inotropic support were randomized to receive usual care (n = 35) or daily NMES applied to both legs (n = 35) -Functional capacity was measured using the 6MWT 24 hours after admission and after 2 weeks or at discharge (whichever came first) -After the protocol, the group receiving NMES had higher 6MWT distances and also had a significantly greater dose reduction of the inotropic support compared to the control group -Authors of an RCT conducted in Brazil of 22 patients hospitalized with COPD found that NMES used in addition to expiratory muscle training improved respiratory muscle strength over the training alone(41) -Respiratory strength was measured by pressure manometry and utilized Russian currents, with electrodes placed over the obliques and rectus abdominis -Researchers in a study in the United Kingdom involving 20 patients with COPD hospitalized for an acute exacerbation found NMES to be a feasible and well-tolerated  intervention that improved quadriceps muscle strength and endurance(42) -Endurance was measured using the ESWT and quad strength using a strain gauge mounted to the back of a chair -The two treatment groups included 10 patients each: one group underwent NMES at 35 Hz and the other at 50 Hz. While there were improvements in all aspects for both groups, only strength increases in the 35 Hz group were statistically significant \u2013Acute critical illness -Authors of a systematic review investigated the use of NMES added to usual care for preventing muscle weakness in critically ill patients admitted to the ICU(49) -Data were included from 8 RCTs involving 172 patients -The duration of the NMES protocols ranged from 7 days to 6 weeks.

However, NMES was associated with higher strength gains during hospitalization -Investigators in Brazil found that NMES combined with conventional physical therapy preserved chest and abdominal muscle thickness in critically ill patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation in the ICU(68) -Based on a double-blind  RCT involving 25 patients; 11 patients received NMES plus conventional therapy, 14 patients received sham NMES plus conventional therapy -Muscle thickness was determined using cross-sectional  ultrasound images -There was a significant decrease in muscle thicknesses in the control group, but no change in these measures in the group receiving NMES. Also, the length of stay in the ICU was found to be significantly shorter in the group receiving NMES -Researchers in Brazil found that patients on hemodialysis improve exercise capacity after peripheral NMES(69) -In a randomized clinical trial, 51 patients were divided into groups receiving either high-intensity  and high-frequency or low-intensity and low-frequency  NMES -Outcome measures included peripheral muscle strength, exercise capacity via 6MWT, levels of muscle trophism markers, and levels of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines -6MWT distance improved in both groups. Peripheral muscle strength improved in the high-frequency  and high-intensity  group but not in the low-frequency  and low-intensity  group -Benefits to muscle trophism occurred only in the low-frequency  and low-intensity  group, and benefits on inflammatory outcomes were specific to the high-frequency  and high-intensity  group -Authors of two systematic reviews in 2020 showed that NMES is a safe and effective treatment modality to improve functional capacity and muscle strength in patients with end-stage  renal disease on hemodialysis(86,87) -Eight studies were included in onesystematic review, with research quality rated fair to good(86) -Functional capacity was measured via the 6MWT -Knee extensor strength and grip strength were improved -QOL was thought to have been improved, but the methodology for this conclusions wasnonspecific -No benefits were found for cardiovascular outcomes nor for muscle mass -Ten studies were included in the next systematic review, but researchers showed that the RCTs used had a possible high risk of bias and the non RCTs had a moderate to critical risk of bias(87) -Quadriceps muscle strength, upper limb strength, and functional capacity were improved -QOL was unable to be analyzed quantitatively  \u2013Sports performance -There is a lack of systematic research into factors that impact NMES effectiveness for athletic training(13) -Studies have reported improvements in maximal strength and anaerobic power in athletes that are likely to affect field performance -Excessive use of NMES might have a detrimental effect on motor coordination, as contractions are typically isometric and nonspecific. Athletic training of complex movements requires high levels of neuromuscular coordination that can be achieved only through voluntary \u201ctechnical\u201d exercise. Use of NMES is recommended in conjunction with voluntary exercise -It is suggested that NMES training is best used early in the training season, to avoid interference with sport-specific training(13) -Use of NMES in high-level  sport is advocated as a supplement rather than a substitute for more traditional forms of training and might be useful in situations in which an athlete\u2019s performance has plateaued(13) \u2013Diabetic foot ulceration -Authors of a systematic review in 2020 found that NMES had a possible role in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers(71) -Seven studies that met inclusion criteria showed improved healing rates in wounds using NMES -Five of the studies combined NMES with heat.They found improved healing rates in diabetic foot ulcers compared with nondiabetic wounds of a similar grade -The studies used were uncontrolled and of a lower power of evidence; researchers pressed for further studies with higher-quality  evidence \u2013DVT -Authors of a 2018 systematic review found that NMES significantly reduced the risk of DVTversus no prophylaxis(72) -Ten RCTs were included -NMES was inferior to the use of heparin in DVT prophylaxis.Evidence supports the use of NMES as an adjunct to heparin \u2013Pediatrics -For neonatal patients with brachial plexus palsy there is mixed evidence for NMES for improving muscle strength and favorable and consistent evidence for NMES for improving active ROM(73) -The studies reviewed had multiple variations in treatment modalities, patient histories, and additional treatments .
