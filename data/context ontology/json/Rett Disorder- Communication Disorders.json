            "Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disease affecting the white matter of the brain. RTT occurs in approximately 1/10,000 females, with onset typically between the ages of 6 months and 2 years.(1,2) RTT leads to cardiac, neurologic, motor, and speech and language complications and impairments.(3) RTT in males is very rare, as it is usually lethal to the male fetus.(1) Late-onset  RTT (after age 3 years) is uncommon and usually is less severe, with better preservation of motor and speech skills.(3) A milder variant of RTT is known as the preserved speech variant (PSV) or Zappella variant of RTT (Z-RTT).(4,49,50,51) Two other of the more common variants of RTT are the early seizure variant (marked by the presence of severe seizures during the first year of life) and the congenital variant (marked by no apparent period of normal development and microcephaly documented at birth).(49,50) Most research confirms that RTT is not a degenerative disease.(5) RTT was previously considered an autism spectrum disorder (ASD); however, it is now a distinct, separate diagnosis.(6,48) Though there are over 200 different mutations or Rett \u201cvariants,\u201d four specific mutations account for most cases of RTT(1)"

            "Music therapy \u2013Music therapy might temporarily motivate patients to interact socially with others and may temporarily diminish hand stereotypies -Based on the results of a research study conducted in Japan of 3 children with RTT (aged 4, 5, and 6 years)(35) -SLPs can implement musical activities in their therapy (e.g., playing the piano or other instruments together, taking turns playing instruments) \u2013Music therapy can encourage communication and learning in patients with RTT(36) -Based on the results of a case study of a female with RTT -During music therapy, the subject was found to demonstrate turn taking, vocalization, anticipation of the desired event, and understanding of cause and effect and object permanence -Weaknesses of the study include subject number (N = 1) and lack of statistical data(36) -Based on a study of 7 girls with RTT conducted in Norway(37) -The subjects were able to indicate choice using eye gaze or nose or hand pointing during musical activities -The accuracy and rate of making choices improved among the subjects during musical activities -The authors also suggest that the relationship between the clinician and the participant is very important and that it is vital that a participant feel comfortable with his or her therapist -With the proper intervention, fluent nonverbal communication (such as the use of mutual imitation, responsiveness to playful teasing, use of basic oral, vocal, and gestural expressions, as well as joint attention and eye gaze) is a realistic goal for nonverbal individuals with RTT.(38) Using humorous interactions and music or singing in therapy, a clinician is more likely to be successful in eliciting turn taking, imitation, joint attention, and vocalization.(38) A \u201cmother-infant\u201d model was described by a researcher and developmental psychologist in 1993(39) in which the goal of the interaction is to develop social play in a spontaneous, enjoyable, and naturalistic manner. Researchers in Scotland note that this model has been and can be used in therapy, and that the naturalistic and biologically based intervention might be appropriate for use with children with RTT(38)",
            "Sensory-motor  rehabilitation \u2013Developmental, Individual Differences, Relationship-Based Approach, also known as Greenspan\u2019s Floortime Model, can be used by clinicians to guide patients with RTT through six developmental levels and to involve them in developmentally appropriate interactions. Much focus is placed on helping the patient be self-regulated,  calm, and focused before he or she interacts with others. In addition, the therapist is encouraged to respond to all intentional and meaningful modes of communication from the patient(40) \u2013Sensory-motor  rehabilitation may improve language, motor, cognitive, and behavioral skills in patients with RTT(41) -Based on a case study of a female with RTT who began a rehabilitation program at age 5 -The treatment program was based on Piaget\u2019s cognitive development theory  -The patient underwent 3 years of visual-motor coordination training as well as a sensory-motor rehabilitation program -After treatment, the subject was able to respond to her name, understand 58 words (compared to 2 words pretreatment), use gestures, play a game, demonstrate symbolic play, and choose requested objects and pictures (discrimination tasks). These were all skills that were deficient pretreatment \u2013SLPs and behavioral therapists need to be trained in sensory motor rehabilitation or visual-motor  coordination in order to implement these models in therapy with the patient \u2013Functional communication training -Authors of a preliminary study conducted in the United States reported that functional communication training in 3 individuals with RTT resulted in positive changes, including novel communicative acts. The 3 females in the study were ages 15, 27, and 47, and all had classic RTT. Functional communication training involved training the participants to use a switch to indicate functional needs. The switch was placed close to each participant\u2019s dominant hand and researchers used positive reinforcement when the participants used the switch to indicate a desire (turning on the TV). Each participant responded quickly to the functional communication training and at the end of 18 sessions was more likely to request that the TV be turned on with the use of the switch versus whining or other undesired behavior. Researchers recommended functional communication training in larger populations of patients with RTT to determine efficacy(53) \u2013Structured overinterpretation, structured total communication, and multimodal cueing -Researchers recommend training eye gaze for functional communication, as well as training teachers and caregivers how to understand and interpret communication attempts. In a study conducted in Israel, researchers found that stereotypical hand motions of 8 females with RTT increased during interruptions in given activities, suggesting that study subjects were attempting to use the hand stereotypies to communicate. These behaviors were found to be consistent by repeated trials, but it was difficult to ascertain if they were intentional. This study was limited by small subject number and inability to unequivocally demonstrate that subjects intentionally used eye gaze or hand stereotypies to communicate(15) -Research is conflicting regarding the efficacy of increasing communication opportunities for children with RTT to improve communication -Improving existing communication attempts as well as increasing the number of communication opportunities for children with RTT might be more effective than training children with RTT to use an AAC device(42,43) -Multimodal cueing (such as verbal and tactile cues) helps maintain the child\u2019s level of alertness and gain the child\u2019s attention -Extra response time is warranted for children with RTT -Caregivers and teachers can reinforce language acts by acknowledging all communication attempts made by the child -In a study conducted in Australia of 3 nonverbal girls with RTT that used video recordings to observe and analyze teacher/student interactions, researchers found that while increased communication opportunities provided by the caregivers did not significantly increase patient responses, all 3 subjects responded to interactions that required a response. This might indicate that some patients with RTT can understand the intent of spoken language (as the subjects did seem to understand that by initiating communication, the caregiver was expecting a response)(44)",
            "AAC can be used to teach patients to make choices, indicate preference, and increase communication skills \u2013Van Acker\u2019s device employs a touch-sensitive  computer screen and animated graphics to allow a patient to request food and other basic needs. In a study conducted in the United States with 3 individuals with RTT(ages 5, 6, and 11 years), researchers found that all of the subjects learned to discriminate and make consistent choices using this device. Weakness of the study includes small subject number(45) \u2013AAC devices such as the Unity 45 One Hit on a Vanguard II (Prentke Romich Company, Wooster, OH), Specs switches (AbleNet Inc., Roseville, MN), single switch devices, and BIGmack Communicators (AbleNet Inc., Roseville, MN) for yes/no answers; LITTLE Step-by-Step  Communicator (AbleNet Inc., Roseville, MN) and Mini-Coms  (Enabling Devices, Hastings-on-Hudson,  NY) for making choices; Jellybean switches (AbleNet Inc., Roseville, MN), Microlight switches (AbleNet Inc., Roseville, MN); and picture communication symbols to make choices and requests and to convey information. When training patients to use a new device, it is important to use the device in a highly motivating activity, and one in which the patient is allowed to direct the activity. Case studies have shown that individuals with RTT can make choices, play games, and express detailed requests using AAC. It is important to note that more complicated devices may be difficult to use for individuals with apraxia or poor hand strength or control(46) -In a study involving 2 girls with RTT (ages 12 and 17), researchers found that after an intensive therapy program provided 3 times per week for 5 months, quantity and quality of the subjects\u2019 responses were improved when they used AAC.(46) The subjects were taught to use aided communication devices to signal \u201cwant\u201d to request a preferred item. Before treatment, the percentage of independent responses was approximately 30%; following treatment, the percentage  of independent responses increased to 57.5% in 1 subject and to 87.5% in the other. Limitations of the study include small subject number(46)",
            "Communication partner training \u2013In a study conducted in the United States with 4 girls with RTT (ages 3 to 7 years) and their communication partners, researchers found that communication partner training resulted in increased communicative initiations by the girls with RTT(47) -Researchers used the context of mealtime to implement communication strategies; communication partners were 2 classroom teachers, 1 classroom aide, and 1 SLP -Each communication partner was trained in 3 to 4 communication strategies to implement during mealtimes with the child with RTT, and their interactions were videotaped and analyzed -The specific strategies trained were tailored to the individual needs of the dyad; however, all communication partners were encouraged to increase their wait time between bites and after asking questions of the girls to allow the girls to communicate desire for another bite or to respond to questions posed -Communication partners were taught to observe the girls for eye gaze, head turns, body movements toward food, vocalizations, and use of low-tech  AAC devices and to actively respond to these communicative behaviors -Researchers\u2019 analysis of the videotapes found that as the communication partner purposefully changed his or her behavior, there were noticeable changes in the child\u2019s behavior as well, namely increased requests for more food and increased initiation of communication by the child .
