HLPPs in schools focus on screening students for NIHL and educating them on the possible effects of harmful noise exposure. A large component of HCPs and HLPPs is to motivate patients to change behavior that is harmful to hearing \u2013In a two-phased  RCT conducted in the United States, researchers compared the effects of a computer program tailored to the risk of exposure of individual employees with a video providing more general information about NIHL. No significant differences were found between control and treatment groups in their use of hearing protection(22) \u2013In an RCT (N = 753) conducted in the United States, researchers measured the effects of a 4-year  school-based  hearing loss prevention program among school-aged  children of farmers. The components of the program included classroom style education on the effects of noise on hearing, noise level assessments done by students on their farms, distribution of free hearing protection, and annual hearing tests for each student. Results based on self-reported  use of hearing protection indicated that the intervention group was twice as likely to wear hearing protection as the control group that received only minimal intervention(23) \u2013In a multiple group study (N = 100) conducted in the United States using random assignment,investigators examined the effects of small-group  vs. individual training (20 minutes) on how to use formable and premolded earplugs. Pre-training earplug insertion was compared to post-training  earplug insertion. Results showed training to have a significant effect on correctness of earplug insertion (measured by sound attenuation values) and that there was no difference between individual and small group training(24) \u2013In a pilot study of an interactive multimedia Internet-based  training program on NIHL prevention for firefighters, researchers in the United States found the program was feasible/cost-effective  and garnered positive reviews from 95% of the 372 firefighters who participated. Based on the feedback from the firefighters in this study, researchers recommended that Internet-based  training programs regarding hearing protection for firefighters have real-life  examples and testimonials as well as individual tailoring and interactive components(40)",
            "Sound conditioning: One paradigm of sound conditioning is the use of lower-level non-traumatic  noise before the patient is exposed to higher level, more damaging noise. A second paradigm is to present continuous noise at a nondamaging level after the harmful noise has been applied.(25) Both paradigms have resulted in reduced effects of sudden acoustic trauma in animals and humans \u2013Many studies on animals have indicated that sound conditioning is effective in creating long-term  protective effects against subsequent harmful forms of acoustic trauma(25) \u2013In an RCT conducted in Italy, 16 young adult subjects with normal hearing (3 groups) were exposed to a 90 dB 2 kHz tone for 10 minutes to induce a TTS. The first group received only the exposure to the 90 dB HL 2 kHz pure tone for 10 minutes. The second group received an ipsilateral 45 dB HL 250 Hz narrow-band noise while simultaneously being exposed to the 90 dB tone. The third group received a contralateral 45 dB HL 250 Hz narrow-band  noise also while being exposed to the 90 dB sound. Results indicated that the low-intensity  narrow-band noise presented ipsilaterally can give protection from induced TTS. Contralateral low-frequency  narrow-band  noise did not induce any protection effect. Results should be interpreted with caution because of the small number of subjects in the study(26)",

Recent trials of NAC on humans show promise but it has not yet been approved for consumer use for reducing hearing loss after sudden impact noise(27) \u2013In a double-blind  RCT conducted in Italy, researchers examined the effects of vitamin B 12 on noise-induced  TTS in 20 young adults. Results indicated that a protective effect of B 12 at 3,000 Hz was found in the experimental group, but researchers caution that further studies are needed(28) \u2013A cell-permeable  JNK ligand (AM-111)  was trialed in Germany in 11 human patients who had experienced at least a 30 dB loss due to sudden exposure to firecracker noise. Two groups received different doses (0.4 or 0.2 g/ml) in the form of one intratympanic injection. Recovery of hearing thresholds in all patients exceeded expected spontaneous recovery.  Use of AM-111  for acoustic trauma is not yet proven effective for patients with NIHL and requires additional studies with additional participants, control groups, and participants with profound hearing loss(29)",
            "Hearing aids with compression \u2013Hearing aids with compression systems are designed to control ambient noise exposures for workers who wear hearing aids and are regularly exposed to hazardous sound levels. Compression automatically reduces gain of the hearing aid when noise input levels exceed a certain threshold \u2013In a single group, within subject study (N = 13) conducted in Canada researchers examined the effects of three forms of compression on speech intelligibility and control of noise exposure. Participants were asked to recognize monosyllabic words delivered in background industrial noise using three different types of compression systems: compression limiting (overall gain is reduced when input levels are high), compression of low frequencies, and compression of high frequencies. Results indicated that the highest intelligibility and lowest noise exposures were obtained through the compression of high frequencies(30)",

In addition to providing information, the goal of education should be to motivate the patient to change behaviors. A hearing loss prevention program for a workplace should include a careful audit of the types of situations and/or materials (machinery) that are harmful to hearing and what resources management are willing to provide to address these hazards(32) In a study conducted in the United States, researchers found that Spanish-speaking workers were not receiving effective hearing loss prevention services as compared with their English-speaking  coworkers because the materials were not in Spanish or culturally appropriate(33)",
        "Adolescents and young adults are at high risk of excessive noise exposure and should be educated specifically about the risk of NIHL related to the use of personal listening devices(34,35,36,65) Education should emphasize that intensity (i.e., music volume) and listening duration are the factors mostly likely to lead to NIHL(34) Whenever possible, individuals should use noise-limiting  headphones when using personal listening devices(34) Messages about hearing conservation should be conveyed to this population through age-appropriate  media such as TV or online blogs(34,35) Education for children and teenagers about personal listening devices and loud-noise  recreational activities and the associated risk of NIHL should emphasize the gradual nature of the damage, the permanent/irreversible nature of the hearing loss, and measures that can be taken to prevent NIHL (e.g., hearing protection)(34,36,37) Audiologists should collaborate with health educators and school nurses to develop NIHL prevention programs for individual schools targeting adolescents and teenagers(48)",
        "It is important to educate parents of adolescents and teenagers about the risk factors for NIHL so that they can be involved in prevention measures. In a study conducted in the United States, researchers used an Internet-based  survey to obtain a nationally representative sample of parents of children aged 13 to 17 years.(51) The total number of respondents who met inclusion criteria was 716. Researchers found that over half of the parents (375/716) did not believe their child was at risk for NIHL and only 31% of parents surveyed had discussed the risk of hearing loss related to excessive noise exposure with their children at some point in the previous2 years.(51) Additionally, researchers found that the only type of activity parents identified as a risk factor for NIHL was playing music too loud, with the majority of parents not recognizing other activities such as operating a lawn mower, hunting, riding a motorcycle, using shop equipment, or participating in band or orchestra activities as potentially risky(51)"
