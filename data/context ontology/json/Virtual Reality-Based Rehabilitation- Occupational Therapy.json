            "Activity-promoting  gaming systems (APGSs) are a new therapy medium that are commercially available and have been utilized for both physical and occupational therapy since 2007.(1) Commercial APGSs such as the Nintendo Wii (Nintendo of America; Redmond, Washington); Sony Playstation 2 EyeToy and Sony Playstation 3 MOVE and Eye (Sony Computer Entertainment; Tokyo, Japan), and Xbox Kinect (Microsoft; Redmond, Washington) involve player movement and, in some cases, weight-bearing  in order to control the gameplay.(2) The active nature of APGSs offers therapists and patients multiple potential benefits to complement traditional therapy plans of care.(2) The growing popularity of APGSs as a rehabilitative tool has led to the development of customized and/or adaptive gaming systems such as the YouGrabber (YouRehab; Schlieren, Switzerland) and ArmeoSpring (Hocoma AG; V olketswil, Switzerland) to facilitate increased ease of use and improved motor performance for patients with various disabilities(32,36,37,38)",
            "The Nintendo Wii utilizes player movement to control the gameplay through an onscreen avatar called a Mii (pronounced \u201cme\u201d), which is an icon representing the player in the game.(2) Movement can be controlled by the Wii remote control, a nunchuk, a balance board, or a combination of these(2,3) \u2013The Wii remote control is similar in size to a television remote, provides basic audio and vibration feedback, and uses a 3-axis  accelerometer to translate body motions into onscreen movement. The Wii allows up to four controllers to be connected wirelessly to the console, thereby allowing for group play and social interaction. An expansion device (Wii MotionPlus) uses a single-  and dual-axis  gyroscope and attaches to the Wii remote and allows for more accurate motion capture and complex gameplay(2) \u2013Another type of controller, the nunchuk, also uses motion-sensing  technology and provides additional challenges for gameplay(2) \u2013The balance board has pressure sensors that are able to translate the movement of the player\u2019s center of pressure(1,2,3) \u2013The signal from the controllers are received by a sensor bar in the game console(2) \u2013The game console comes with Wii Sports, which is a game package for the Wii remote and nunchuk with Tennis, Baseball, Boxing, Bowling, and Golf \u2013Another program that can be purchased separately is Wii Fit, which uses the balance board to play games that test balance, fitness, and strength(2) \u2013The Wii tracks a player\u2019s progress over time and self-adjusts to the user\u2019s performance to provide a challenge that is \u201cjust right\u201d rather than too difficult and frustrating(3) ",
            "The EyeToy is played on the PlayStation 2 (Sony Computer Entertainment) and differs from the Wii by using a color video camera (similar to a Webcam) that is capable of gesture recognition allowing for motion-controlled  gameplay(2,3) \u2013PlayStation Move (Sony Computer Entertainment) is similar to the Wii and players use motion controllers (wands) during gameplay. It uses the camera on the EyeToy to track the wand\u2019s position in space and detects motion using inertial sensors with a 3-axis  linear accelerometer and a 3-axis angular rate sensor(2) \u2013The EyeToy provides a unique opportunity for occupational therapy by providing games that focus on noncompetitive activities such as spinning plates, painting rainbows, working the back kitchen of a restaurant, popping bubbles, chopping food, and playing air guitar(3)",
            "Playstation MOVETM for Playstation 3 is a motion-sensing game controller platform which works by using a Universal Serial Bus camera to track the three-dimensional  movement of a lighted ball on a hand-held  controller and internal sensors(17) \u2013Participants are 5-7 feet in front of a TV monitor with the Playstation Eye (the new version of the EyeToy for Playstation 3) camera placed near the monitor. The user holds the motion controller in one hand and moves it according to the activity demands",
            "The Kinect is a motion sensing input device where the users control and interact with the game via an infrared projector and camera and a special microchip to track movement of the user(17) \u2013It has 3D motion capture, gesture, facial and voice recognition capabilities \u2013It is completely hands-free  of electronic controllers",
            "SeeMe ( http://www.virtual-reality-rehabilitation.com/ ) virtual reality system is a PC based, clinician\u2013controlled  exercise and diagnostic system that utilizes a laptop and Kinect technology. It is designed to improve coordination, balance, muscle strength, range of motion, reaction times, memory",
            "SilverFit is a virtual reality program that was designed specifically for older adults that consists of a camera that captures limb and trunk movements, a computer monitor, and a processing unit(3) \u2013The system provides 7 types of games designed to elicit movements from the player \u2013Developed by physiotherapists in the Netherlands",
            "GoGo TV Vision is an interactive gaming system comprised of a game console, camera, and TV monitor; it was originally designed for children but can be used with adults(3) \u2013The camera projects the participant\u2019s movements onto the TV screen in real time \u2013Activities include juggling balloons, solving mazes, breaking bricks, and playing card games \u2013This system can be used to target reaction time, upper extremity movement, and balance",
            "GestureTek Interactive Rehabilitation Exercise System (IREX) is a gaming system controlled solely by gestures(3) \u2013The system uses a green chroma key screen to create a complex, immersive virtual environment for the patient \u2013Provides a tracking tool called the \u201cSession Management Tool\u201d to monitor patient progress \u2013The system is only available by contacting the manufacturer directly and requires both expert installation and a large space allocation",
            "The YouGrabber\u00aeis an interactive virtual reality gaming system designed to improve bimanual dexterity skills, upper extremity coordination, and cognitive functioning(39) \u2013It consists of a pair of adjustable gloves that contain movement tracking sensors, which are worn while completing computer-based  games/activities \u2013Games/activities can be adapted to accommodate varying ability levels \u2013The system can be used in the clinic or home settings",
            "The Armeo\u00aeSpring is an exoskeleton-based  interactive gaming system designed to promote improved upper extremity motor function(40) \u2013The exoskeleton device monitors arm and hand movement patterns during game-like  exercises, provides feedback, and tracks progress \u2013The exercises are included in the system\u2019s software package and can be adapted according to a patient\u2019s motor and cognitive abilities \u2013The exercises allow for either single-joint  movements or complex movements depending on a patient\u2019s goals"

        "treatment summary": [
            "Occupational therapy intervention programs can use APGSs for patients with the following needs and/or deficits: \u2013Balance training(1,2,34) \u2013Upper extremity impairment; hemiplegia(1,2,3,31,32,37) \u2013Social interaction and participation(2,3) \u2013Cognitive retraining(1,3) \u2013Visual attention, visual motor skills, and/or scanning deficits(1,3,38)",
            "Motor delays(39)APGSs and multiple sclerosis (MS) \u2013A 2015 review of the use of gaming technology for rehabilitation in people with MS stated that the current research is contradictory and that there is no consensus on training duration/intensity and outcomes used to measure clinical effectiveness. The review did state that exergames were seen as enjoyable and could be effective in enhancing adherence to a rehabilitation program(21) \u2013The Wii Fit was found to be comparable to a traditional balance training when considering the physical effects of exergaming in patients with MS in an RCT conducted in the United Kingdom(18) -Fifty-six  adults with MS randomized into 3 groups: balance training using Nintendo Wii Fit (exergaming), traditional balance training, and a control group that received no intervention -Exergaming and traditional group received four weeks of twice weekly 40-60  minute exercise sessions. Exergaming on the Wii Fit utilized Soccer Heading, Ski Slalom, Table Tilt, Tightrope Walk, Rhythm Boxing, Basic Step and Hula Hoop ; for traditional group, balance exercises were chosen that had gross movement patterns and demands similar to the Wii Fit -Primary outcome measures were postural sway on force plate, gait (as measured on GAITRiteTM walkway), technology acceptance and flow experience (i.e., measure of motivating state that encourages repeat activity) -Both interventions (exergaming and traditional) significantly improved bipedal postural sway when compared to control, but had no effects on gait. Flow experience with exergaming was superior to traditional balance training suggesting it is intrinsically motivating to patients with MS \u2013Playing exergames on an unstable surface, utilizing Wii Sports/Sports Resort/Fit games, may be an effective way to improve balance and gait in patients with MS, especially in dual-task  situations, and also seems to increase adherence to a home-based  balance training program(22)  -Matched controlled trial conducted in Germany with 61 patients with MS and balance problems assigned to one of three training groups: conventional balance training (control), exergame training (playing exergames on unstable platform), or single-task exercises on the unstable platform -All groups met 9 times over a 3-week  period for 30 minutes each session -Outcome measures were 6 static balance tests on a forceplate, 4 balance tests on an unstable surface (Posturomed) and 2 gait analyses (Optogait). The dual task was performing a Wii golf pitch with a defined amplitude -All 3 groups showed significant improvements in balance tests and gait scores, but only the exergame training showed significantly higher improvements in the dual task situation -Adherence to the home-based  balance training program was significantly higher in the exergame training group",
            "APGSs and stroke \u2013Two systemic reviews (one with meta-analysis)  conducted in 2015 evaluating the use of the Wii in the rehabilitation of stroke patients concluded: -There is not sufficient evidence to ensure the effectiveness and support the inclusion of the Wii in the treatment of post-stroke  sequelae, but some studies suggest that Wii can provide improvement in motor function(23) -The addition of Wii gaming significantly improved performance in the TUG test, but not for scores on FIM, Berg Balance Score, and postural sway(24) -This meta-analysis  also showed the Wii was safe for patients with stroke and that there was a decreased risk of dropping out of follow-up  when the Wii was utilized \u2013Videogames were found to be as effective as traditional therapy in improving indicators of physical activity (gait speed, grip strength of weaker hand, stronger hands overall) of individuals with chronic stroke, and were found to be feasible, safe and satisfying(25) -An RCT conducted in Israel with 47 community-dwelling individuals with chronic stroke randomly assigned to videogame or traditional therapy in a group setting -OTs selected consoles and games based on abilities, balance, and ability to walk. Available gaming systems were Kinect, Eyetoy, MOVE, Wii Fit and SeeMe virtual reality. Conventional therapy were task-orientated  exercises that have been reported to be effective in acute and chronic stroke -Interventions were 2 one-hour  sessions per week for 3 months -Satisfaction for video game group was 93% and for traditional therapy was 71% -Daily steps (measured by hip accelerometer) and functional ability of the weaker hand (measured by The Action Research Arm Test) did not increase for either groups \u2013The same research group investigated a subset of patients of the above-mentioned  RCT to determine the number of purposeful and non-purposeful  repetitions of the weaker upper extremity as well as the movement accelerations of both upper extremities in patients with chronic stroke while playing videogames or participating in traditional therapy and concluded that participation in videogames elicited more upper extremity purposeful repetitions and higher acceleration of movement than traditional therapy(26) -An RCT conducted in Israel with 29 patients (1-7years post-stroke)  videotaped while wearing wrist accelerometers \u2013In a study that included 20 inpatients with hemiparesis (12 months post-stroke,  mean age 61.1 years), participants took part in a 4-week  training program(2) -In addition to a conventional rehabilitation program, half of the group also received 30 minutes of treatment with the EyeToy (5 games that all trained the upper limb) and the remaining half received a placebo of watching the games for the same duration without any physical involvement -According to follow-up  measures at the conclusion of the study, upper-limb  motor function benefited more from EyeToy games in addition to the conventional rehabilitation program than rehabilitation with the placebo EyeToy; this effect carried over during the 3-month  follow-up \u2013A randomized, single-blind  clinical trial, which compared the outcomes of NintendoWii with recreational therapy on the motor recovery of acute stroke patients,highlighted the importance of a task-specific  rehabilitative approach with appropriate levels of intensity to promote upper limb recovery post-stroke(31) -Included 121 patients from in-patient  rehabilitation centers in 4 countries who had had an ischemic stroke \u22643 months of the start of the study -The Wii group received 10 60-minute  sessions that included patient-selected  games from Wii Sports and Game Party 3 to promote improved ROM, strength, flexibility, and coordination of the affected upper extremity; the recreational therapy group participated in patient-selected  activities that involved upper extremity use (e.g., card games, bingo,  Jenga, ball game); both groups continued to receive conventional therapy with a similar average total time spent in therapy between groups -Results of the Wolf Motor Function Test, completed at 2-weeks  and 4-weeks  post-intervention,  indicated improvements with upper extremity function within both groups; however, there was no significant difference between groups -Researchers concluded that task-specific  training with increasing levels of intensity best supports early recovery of upper limb functioning following stroke, which can include the use of virtual reality gaming systems or inexpensive recreational activities \u2013In a study that investigated the effectiveness of a custom virtual reality gaming system (YouGrabber\u00ae) as a rehabilitation tool for patients with chronic stroke, the gaming system was found to be a practical method to support improved upper limb functioning(32) -Study was conducted at a community rehabilitation center in the United Kingdom and included 12 participants with chronic stroke (stroke occurred \u22656 months before enrollment) who were randomly assigned to either the YouGrabber\u00aegroup or the gym group -The intervention lasted 12 weeks, included 18 training sessions, and was completed in addition to usual treatment of therapeutic exercise -The YouGrabber\u00ae group used the gaming system for approximately 30 minutes per session; games designed to work on dexterity, mirror imaging, and grasp and release were included in intervention sessions -The gym group received additional personalized instruction in therapeutic exercises -Post-intervention  testing (Motor Activity Log) indicated improvements with upper extremity functioning within the YouGrabber\u00ae group, though the improvements were not large enough to indicate statistical significance between groups; slight increased fatigue was also noted among both groups -The YouGrabber\u00ae group also reported benefits (e.g., improved balance and posture, perceptual skills, and motivation) and challenges (e.g., technological difficulties, limited structure in the progression of games, frustration, fatigue) of using the gaming system -Researchers concluded that the YouGrabber\u00ae gaming system is as effective as gym-based  rehabilitation for people with chronic stoke and may be a practical rehabilitation tool for this population",
            "APGSs and older adults \u2013One study examined the use of the Wii Bowling game as part of an 8-week  fall prevention program(14) -Three groups of older adults with histories of falling participated in the study -Group 1 (8 subjects) participated in the Wii Bowling intervention as well as fall prevention education group once per week -Group 2 (6 subjects) participated in the Wii Bowling intervention only once per week -Group 3 (7 subjects) participated in no type of therapy and simply completed the pre- and posttests at the same time as the other groups -The assessments used for the study were the Control, Autonomy, Self-Realization,  Pleasure-19  (CASP-19); the Social Provisions Scale (SPA); and the Modified Falls Efficacy Scale (M-FES) -Overall, there were no group-related  significant differences found on the posttests; however, qualitatively patients verbalized enjoyment of the bowling games and overall satisfaction with the Wii Bowling intervention \u2013In a study that included healthy older adults (aged 74 to 94 years) without any significant medical conditions, researchers examined the effect of a Wii Fit training program on the group\u2019s balance(10) -Pre- and posttest assessments of balance were completed using the Berg Balance Scale -The intervention consisted of three 20-minute sessions per week for 4 weeks total with 10 minutes of Wii Fit balance games and 10 minutes of Wii Fit aerobics -At the conclusion of the study, the group\u2019s Berg Balance Scale scores had increased significantly; group mean was 25.03% improvement \u2013Another study found the Xbox Kinect to be a feasible balance training method for older adults(34) -Thirteen older adults (aged 70 years and older) were randomly divided into the experimental group (Kinect training 3x/week for 3 weeks using activities from Your Shape: Fitness Evolved  and Kinect Adventures!)  or the control group (normal daily activities) -Balance assessments were completed before the intervention, 1-week  post-intervention,  and 1-month post-intervention; assessments included the Berg Balance Scale, Fullerton Advanced Balance Scale, Functional Reach, and TUG -Significant improvements on the Berg Balance Scale and Fullerton Advanced Balance Scale were found for the experimental group, while no significant changes were found for the control group ",
            "APGSs and Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) \u2013A systematic review of the role of exergaming in PD rehabilitation concluded that exergaming is an emerging tool to help rehabilitate motor skills in patients with PD. They did advise that commercial games may be too difficult for some people with PD and called for tailor-made  exergames that address the rehabilitation needs and capabilities of people with PD(27) \u2013Kinect-based  training was found to be safe and feasible for people with PD (Hoehn and Yahr Stages 2 and 3) in a pilot study conducted in Brazil(28) -Fourteen 60-minute  sessions, three times a week, playing four games of Kinect Adventures -The 7 patients showed improvement in game scores as well as Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT) for distance, Balance Evaluation System Test, Dynamic Gait Index (DGI) and Parkinson\u2019s Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) \u2013In a case study of a 68-year-old  male with PD , the patient participated in a protocol of 12 treatments with the Wii Sports games in an outpatient group setting over the course of 4 weeks(3) -Participants in this study played the games individually and together -At the conclusion of the program, the patient had made substantial gains in motor performance and self-reported  quality of life, and continued to play the Wii games at home with his children and grandchildren",
            "APGSs and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) \u2013The Xbox Kinect was found to be a feasible method of reducing fall risk and maintaining balance and functional mobility for people with PSP, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder(35) -Based on the results of a case study involving a 65-year-old  female with a diagnosis of PSP -The participant had a history of frequent falls due to axial rigidity, retropulsion, and poor postural control with dynamic tasks; difficulties with visual tracking and cognitive awareness were also noted -Twelve 1-hour  sessions completed over 6 weeks of Xbox Kinect training using the YourShape  game was included in her outpatient rehabilitation treatment plan due to reports of declining function and a desire for a more enjoyable and motivating intervention technique",
            "Outcome measures indicated stable balance on the Berg Balance Scale, a decline in the frequency of falls, improved postural control, and maintenance of lower extremity strength and functional mobility; the participant self-reported  a decline in quality of life, though this was attributed to visual changes resulting in impaired ability to complete certain leisure tasks and improved cognitive awareness of deficits APGSs and pediatrics \u2013The Wii may be of use as an exertion challenge to evaluate tolerance for exercise post-concussion  in youth ages 9-18; however, it is not a valid measure of balance impairment post mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI)(29) -A cross-sectional  study conducted in Canada of 24 youth with MTBI who played six Wii games -Bruininks-Oseretsky  Test of Motor Proficiency 2nd edition and the Community Balance and Mobility Scale were used as balance indicators. Heart rate, respiration rate, and caloric expenditure were used as measures of exertion \u2013A study that included 3 adolescents with severe hemiplegic cerebral palsy examined the effect of an in-home  virtual reality video game telerehabilitation program on hand function and forearm bone health(13) -The participants were asked to use a virtual reality video game-based  (PlayStation 3 console) rehabilitation program using the weaker hand for 30 minutes per day 5 days per week for 3 months -The game was controlled by a sensor glove (5 Ultra Glove) worn on the hemiplegic hand -All of the games involved either finger flexion/extension or thumb movement and had originally been developed for use in adults with chronic stroke -The game system was linked through an Internet connection to a similar system set up in the lab so that the OT could monitor each patient\u2019s progress -Baseline measurements were taken for hand and pincer grip strength with a dynamometer and pinchometer. Initial hand function was assessed with the Bruininks-Oseretsky  Test of Motor Proficiency and the Jebsen Hand Function Test as well as a measurement of finger ROM taken from the 5DT sensor glove. Baseline forearm bone health was assessed using dual-energy  absorptiometry (DXA) and peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) -The 3 participants did not complete the program exactly as asked due to frustration, fatigue, or difficulty finding the time; however, all of the participants showed improvement on both grip strength and the Jebsen Hand Function Test, including a clinically meaningful improvement in the ability to lift both light and heavy objects -The 2 subjects who logged the most practice hours had more qualitative improvements than the third subject who had practiced the least -Finger ROM improved for 4/5 fingers in 1 subject and 3/5 fingers in the other 2 subjects  -The 2 participants who practiced the most showed an increase in bone mineral content (BMC) on the posttests of forearm bone health \u2013A study examining the use of adaptive commercial gaming systems to promote bimanual upper extremity use during video game play indicated that the system may be a beneficial rehabilitative tool for adolescents with hemiparesis and an effective method for therapists to monitor performance with home programs(37) -The study used a specialized computer application, along with interfaces from 2 commercial gaming systems (PlayStation Move and Microsoft Kinect), to track bimanual upper extremity movement patterns while playing video games through a social media web site (Facebook); the application either required both hands to move in either the same direction or around the circumference of a circle -A second computer application allowed therapists to monitor performance through the social media web site -The study included 2 adolescent participants with hemiparesis; an additional healthy participant with no limitations in upper extremity functioning was used as a control -Each participant completed a 90-minute  session using the computer application system to play a designated video game; data for total distance traveled by each hand, wrist ROM, trunk movements, and hand offsets with vertical movements was collected throughout game play -Results indicated greater wrist ROM of the hemiparetic arm for 1 participant during game play when compared to the other participant who had more limited wrist ROM at baseline; results also indicated excessive trunk movements/ compensation for 1 participant and asymmetric bilateral vertical movement patterns for both participants during game play -Researchers concluded that the adaptive motion tracking and gaming system may allow therapists to monitor upper extremity use during home-based programs, identify discrepancies between clinic and home performance, and modify treatment plans to best support progress \u2013Another study that included 5 children with cerebral palsy utilized the EyeToy for an in-home  therapy program targeting upper extremity movement(15) -Participants were asked to use the game system for 30 minutes per day for 10 consecutive days -The participants were instructed to hold down a button with the nonhemiplegic hand that kept the game turned on (and occupied that arm) while playing the game using the hemiplegic arm to control the onscreen movements and environment -Caregiver and patient questionnaires administered after the conclusion of the program noted high levels of satisfaction with the program -Outcome measures assessed the number of times the nonhemiplegic hand button was released, which decreased from 3.0 times \u00b1 2.7 to 1.9 times \u00b1 1.6, indicating increased use of the hemiplegic upper extremity for gameplay \u2013A study that utilized an adaptive device to make video games more accessible to children with developmental disabilities resulted in improved motor coordination and visual motor skill performance among study participants(38) -Twenty children with developmental disabilities participated in a 5-week  intervention consisting of 30-minute  sessions using an adaptive video game device designed to increase functional upper extremity movements while limiting compensatory trunk movements; the device included an optical sensor platform, specialized joystick, notebook computer, and game software -After the intervention, scores on the Beery-Buktenica Developmental Test of Visual Motor Integration and Peabody Developmental Motor Scales, 2nd Edition significantly improved from pretest scores -Researchers concluded that adaptive video game technology can be an effective rehabilitative technique to promote motor skill development in children with developmental delays \u2013For additional information on the use of the Nintendo Wii Fit and Rehabilitation in Children and Adolescents, see Clinical Review\u2026 Nintendo Wii Fit and Rehabilitation in Children and Adolescents",
