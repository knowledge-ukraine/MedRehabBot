            "Agnosia is the failure to recognize incoming information despite an intact sensory system.(1,2) It has been described as having \u201cperception stripped of its meaning.\u201d(2) The condition is rare and can affect perception by any single sense (e.g., vision, hearing, touch) or perception of any specific thing (e.g., faces, sounds, colors, objects).(1,2) For an overview of agnosia, see Clinical Review\u2026Agnosia ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T708855.In auditory verbal agnosia (also called pure word deafness), a person is unable to assign meaning to spoken words. Auditory verbal agnosia most frequently occurs in adults; however, cases have been documented in children as well.(15) Although typically a stable condition, there have been several documented cases of progressive auditory verbal agnosia associated with a progressive underlying condition such as dementia(18,19)"
