            "Electromyography (EMG) is a diagnostic test that measures the electrical activity within a muscle.(1) EMG is not able to determine whether a patient is aspirating, the effect of postural or food texture changes on the safety of swallowing, or the effectiveness of compensatory strategies. EMG is performed with a machine called an electromyograph, which records the muscle\u2019s electrical activity and produces a trace that can be analyzed and compared to normative data.(1,2) Needle EMG is performed with fine needle electrodes that are inserted into the muscles through the patient\u2019s skin. For the purpose of dysphagia assessment, needle EMG is performed on those muscles that are innervated by cranial nerves, such as the muscles of the tongue, larynx, and face.(1) Surface EMG (sEMG) utilizes electrodes that do not pierce the skin, and instead record electrical activity from the surface of the skin.(3) Kinesiologic EMG refers to an EMG study in which the patient performs functional tasks, such as swallowing, and can be combined with video recordings of movements of the jaws, tongue, and/or larynx in order to understand what functional movements are producing each specific electrical output(4)"
