            "Apraxia is an inability to perform learned movements voluntarily that does not result from a motor or sensory impairment (i.e., weak muscles, hemiplegia) or lack of cooperation (e.g., apathy, depression).(65) Apraxia affects learned, or intentional, fine or gross motor movements or patterns of movement (e.g., pantomiming/gesturing, using a toothbrush and toothpaste to brush the teeth).(65) AOS is an acquired, neurological motor speech disorder that affects the precision and consistency of movements for speech, causing impaired speech intelligibility.(64) With AOS, the patient is able to formulate intended messages in the brain; however, the connection to the muscles of speech and articulation is disrupted.(64) Despite intact muscle strength, a patient with AOS is unable to move his or her lips and tongue into the correct positions to form intended sounds, words, phrases, or sentences (depending on severity level)(64)"

MAF is a type of altered auditory feedback (AAF) in which the speaker hears his or her own speech through headphones and it is continuously augmented by an additional masking sound, such as white noise. Researchers compared speech fluency when subjects were reading sentences while listening to normal auditory feedback (i.e., their own voice), MAF, and delayed/pitch-modified  auditory feedback. Additionally, researchers assessed the effects of the various types of auditory feedback on speech fluency on healthy, nonapraxic adult subjects. Researchers found that the MAF did improve speech fluency in several of the apraxic/ aphasic subjects, but not all. The other type of AAF (delayed/pitch-modified)  was not beneficial for any of the subjects. Researchers encouraged additional research with larger sample sizes to determine the effectiveness of MAF on improving speech fluency(69) -In a case study in the United States, authors investigated the effects of electromagnetic articulography with an adult with Broca\u2019s aphasia and AOS to train the sounds /s/ and /sh/.(5) The treatment involved 5 sessions in which the patient was placed in front of a monitor displaying a midsagittal portion of the tongue tip. Small receiver coils were attached to the subject\u2019s articulators by biocompatible glue and were then connected to a computer by means of fine wires leading from the corner of the subject\u2019s mouth. When the patient hit the target region of the palate with the tongue tip, a pleasing tone sounded and a balloon image would rise on the screen. During the therapy sessions, the patient performed four tasks: silent (touching the target zone with tongue), humming, nonword, and real word. Results indicated that patient was able to improve /s/-/sh/  contrasts in nonwords and, to a lesser extent, in real words. Data regarding social validity and generalization of effects in conversational speech are lacking. The authors caution that the clinical utility of this method is low due to the high cost and technical expertise needed to use the equipment(5) -Authors of a case study on a 59-year-old  female with AOS used ultrasound feedback of the tongue to assist the patient in correcting errors on rhotic sounds. Treatment took place over 12 sessions with 2 60-minute  sessions per week. The first 6 sessions addressed production of prevocalic \u201cr,\u201d targeting the variants in \u201cray\u201d and \u201crow.\u201d The final sessions addressed postvocalic \u201cr,\u201d targeting the variants in \u201care\u201d and \u201cor.\u201d During sessions visual feedback on a computer screen display from an ultrasound probe held beneath the chin was used by the clinician to improve \u201cr\u201d productions. Prior to intervention, the patient could not produce the rhotic sounds. At the conclusion of the intervention, the patient was still unable to produce prevocalic \u201cr\u201d; however,she had average scores of 71.9% accuracy with postvocalic \u201cr\u201d(61) Approaches for improving prosody (rate and or rhythm) \u2013Metronomic pacing(47) -The use of metronomic pacing was investigated in 3 separate studies with positive results; however, all 3 studies used different techniques: -Pairing metronomic pacing with the production of nonspeech movements, alternate motion rate productions, multisyllabic word productions, and sentence productions(50) -Pairing metronomic pacing with production of isolated vowels, vowel sequences, and vowel plus /h/ sequences(51) -Pairing metronomic pacing with multisyllabic word production(52) -Given that no single technique was replicated in multiple studies, this technique has promise but limited empirical support  -The effectiveness of a rate/rhythm control treatment was investigated in a single-subject  design study in the United States with 10 participants with apraxia and aphasia.(36) All participants first received treatment that involved repeated practice (see study described above under \u201cRepeated practice\u201d). Rate/rhythm control treatment was applied after a plateau was reached with repeated practice treatment to determine if additional  gains could be observed with rate/ rhythm control treatment. Treatment involved repeated practice (repeating an item 5 times) with the addition of hand-tapping  in time to the beat of a digital metronome. Two participants did not receive rate/rhythm control treatment because they achieved positive responses with repeated treatment alone. Six participants showed modest gains with the addition of the rate/rhythm control treatment \u2013Melodic Intonation Therapy (MIT):  MIT targets prosodic aspects of speech (tempo, pitch, rhythm, and stress) and has been investigated primarily in studies of patients with aphasia and children with developmental AOS(53) -MIT is a hierarchically structured treatment in 4 levels: -The clinician hums a melody pattern and the patient taps the rhythm and stress(53) -The patient taps and repeats the clinician\u2019s production of the intoned utterance(53) -The clinician and patient produce the intonation in unison and the clinician\u2019s participation is faded. The patient is required to give an appropriate intoned response to the clinician\u2019s intoned probe question(53) -Normal speech prosody is the final goal(53) -A technique called speech-song  (sprechgesang ) is used in transition to normal speech prosody. The patient may continue to use hand tapping to maintain rhythm and stress(53) -In speech song, the melodic line of the intoned utterance is retained but the constant pitch of intoned words is replaced by the variable of speech(53) -The effects of MIT on patients with AOS are promising but preliminary. No studies using MIT with adults with clearly defined AOS have been published, only those with Broca\u2019s aphasia. In an unpublished study in the United States, researchers investigated the effects of MIT with 2 subjects with AOS and Broca\u2019s aphasia and found that MIT was effective in increasing fluency, rate, repetition, stress, and grammatical features of speech(54)Authors of a case study on a 56-year-old  male with AOS following a stroke reported improvement in the production of complex consonant blends and generalization to untreated simple consonant blends, both at the word level. Additionally, researchers documented significant activation in the brain regions responsible for phonological processing after this treatment. The implicit treatment protocol was designed to allow the participant to manipulate phonemes in order to create his own word and then associate this word with an image. As an example, the participant would be shown 4 pictures and given the instructions: \u201cI want you to point to the correct picture, think about it, don\u2019t say it out loud. \u2018Eaks,\u2019 what would it be if you added \u201cstr\u201d to the beginning?,\u201d and then he would be shown a picture of \u201cseeks,\u201d \u201cpeaks,\u201d \u201csneaks,\u201d and \u201cstreaks\u201d(60) Two emerging treatments for AOS with minimal, but promising, evidence for their effectiveness are transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and self-administered  computer treatments. tDCS involves painless, noninvasive stimulation of the brain with electrical currents passed between electrodes on the head to stimulate specific regions of the brain. Self-administered  computer treatments involve programs that patients can download to their computer or tablet for repetition and naming practice(74)Communication boards, speech-generating  devices, or a gestural system such as American Indian Sign (Amerind) might be considered for patients with AOS when oral speech is not intelligible(55,56,57) \u2013For detailed information on assessment and treatment using AAC for patients with severe communication impairments, see the series of Clinical Reviews on this topic .

        "treatment summary": [
            "Authors of a systematic review published in 2015 that included 26 studies from 2004 to 2012 investigating the effects of treatment for acquired AOS reported that the evidence was Class III to Class IV (meaning there were no case controlled studies, retrospective cohort studies, or RCTs). Class III studies were those that were controlled studies and used within-participant  designs and masked, objective, or independent outcomes and Class IV studies were uncontrolled. Of the 26 studies, the researchers concluded that 18 had high to reasonable methodological quality. The evidence of the studies indicated a strong effect for articulatory-kinematic  and rate/rhythm treatment approaches (both described below) for acquired AOS(67)",
            "Authors of a published review in the United States of 42 treatment studies for AOS completed between 1973 and 2002 found that there are several treatments that have been described for AOS; however, very few treatments have been systematically evaluated in repeated studies.(35) The review authors also found limited information regarding dosage of treatment, generalization effects, maintenance effects, or relative effects of different treatments(35)",
            "A systematic review commissioned by the Academy of Neurologic Communication Disorders and Sciences (ANCDS) in Washington, D.C., was completed to develop practice guidelines for AOS. A total of 59 studies were included in the review. Reviewers categorized treatments into four main types: articulatory kinematic, intersystemic facilitation/ reorganization, alternative/augmentative communication, andrate and/or rhythm.(3) Most treatment research for AOS has centered on articulatory kinematic treatments, such as Sound Production Treatment (SPT),which have been found to provide gains in speech production even for patients with chronic or severe deficits. Gains in articulation, fluency, and reduced rate or decrease in overall AOS symptoms have also been noted for some patients who have received rate/ rhythm control treatment. Intersystemic reorganization involves the use of relatively intact systems (e.g., manual gestures) to facilitate functioning of systems that are impaired (e.g., articulatory). Preliminary studies have shown promise for intersystemic facilitation/treatment in improving articulation and gestural abilities. However, there are comparatively few studies and more research is needed. AAC approaches may be recommended for some patients with very limited verbal output. However, there are insufficient data to determine whether AAC approaches may be successful for patients with AOS(3)",
            "There have been no randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of any treatment for AOS(2,67)",
            "Repeated practice: Repeated practice of words or phrases is a common element of most treatments for AOS. In a United States single-subject  experimental design study (multiple probe across behaviors and multiple baseline across participants) of 10 adults with AOS and aphasia, researchers investigated the effects of repeated practice on sound production accuracy.(36) The investigators defined repeated practice as \u201cproducing a target item five times after a single model with general feedback provided after the group of productions\u201d (p. S6). Modeling and specific feedback were absent in the treatment to assess the effects of repeated practice alone. Five lists of stimuli of 20 items each were developed for each participant to correspond to the level of production in which sound errors were the most prevalent. Items ranged in complexity from monosyllabic words to multisyllabic words in sentences. Treatment was provided 3 times a week for 1.25\u20131.5  hours. During the repeated practice treatment, participants practiced three lists. Two other lists served as \u201cno treatment lists\u201d\u2014one with limited probing and the other with more frequent probing. Participants received treatment until a high level of accuracy was reached or until they reached a plateau in performance. Results indicated that repeated practice resulted in improved performance for the majority of participants (80%); the amount of improvement varied within and across participants ",
            "Approaches for improving articulatory positioning (articulatory/kinematic): Treatment approaches that support improved movement and/or positioning of the articulators for more intelligible speech production(2,3) \u2013General principles of the articulatory/kinematic approach(1,37) -Build in a high level of patient motivation and success -Provide observational learning (e.g., modeling, graphic representations of articulators) -Use extensive and intensive drill with a large number of repetitions -Use primarily speech tasks rather than nonspeech tasks -A hierarchical approach should be used. For example, work on sounds in isolation, then in syllables and in words -There should be some focus on prosody (contrastive stress drills) -Introduce meaningful or functional material as soon as possible to allow for generalization -Use a combination of randomized presentation of sounds (different sounds) and blocked presentation of sounds (multiple presentations of the same sound) \u2013SPT: SPT is an articulatory-kinematic  treatment that targets specific consonant production by using modeling, repetition, minimal pair contrast, integral stimulation (e.g., watch me, listen to me, say it with me), articulatory placement cueing, and feedback(4,38,39,70) -The basic steps of the response-contingent  hierarchy include the following: -Produce the target phrase or word in a minimal pair context or alone following a verbal model by the therapist(4) -Repeat step 1 with a written cue (e.g., printed letter of the target sound)(4) -Produce the target word only with integral stimulation(4) -Produce the target word only with articulatory placement cues and a model from the therapist(4) -Produce the target sound in isolation with a model(4) -The therapist presents the next item(4) -Multiple studies have demonstrated positive effects of SPT on targeted sounds in trained and untrained exemplars with strong maintenance of the effects at 1\u20132 months post treatment(4,58) -Authors of a meta-analysis  of SPT published in 2015 found 10 published reports on the effects of SPT for individuals with AOS. The data analyzed in the meta-analysis  were taken from 24 individuals. Authors found that effect sizes for SPT varied according to the specific target of treatment and from participant to participant; however, they were generally large and positive. The data also suggested that more severe AOS led to greater effect sizes from SPT. Authors of the meta-analysis  concluded that SPT is likely beneficial for individuals with AOS; however, it is unknown which components of SPT are essential and which are extraneous. Additionally, more research should be done examining the underlying neural changes that result from SPT(70) -In a study conducted in the United States with 20 individuals with AOS, researchers compared results from SPT with a blocked practice schedule versus a randomized practice schedule. All of the participants in the study made gains and there was not a significant difference between blocked or random practice schedules. Additionally, generalization was observed to untreated items for both groups, but improvement on untreated items was not as strong as that on treated items(75) -In a study conducted in the United States, researchers employed a multiple baseline design across participants and behaviors to study the effects of 2 treatment intensities and 2 schedules of practice of SPT with 4 participants who had chronic AOS and aphasia.(39) Each participant received 4 variations of SPT: 1) intensive-blocked  practice, 2) intensive-random  practice, 3) traditional-blocked  practice, and 4) traditional-random  practice. Blocked stimulus practice refers to practicing the same behaviors repeatedly with no intervening trials of other behaviors (e.g., /b/ would be targeted on all items followed by /k/ stimulus items). Random practice involves practicing all items in a mixed and nonpredictable order (e.g., /b/ and /k/ items would be targeted simultaneously). All phases of treatment lasted 16 hours, with intensive treatment provided in 4 hourly treatment sessions per day, 4 days per week (total = 1 week). \u201cTraditional\u201d phases were provided in 1 hourly session per day, 3 days a week (total = 5.5 weeks). All participants showed positive changes in accuracy for all phases of treatment. Follow-up  data did not indicate any clinically meaningful differences among treatment applications. Researchers hypothesized that extending treatment to include higher levels of accuracy might have revealed possible differences in conditions(39) \u2013PROMPT:  In this approach, the patient is provided with proprioceptive, pressure, and spatial information using oral-facial  prompts. In two case studies performed in the United States with participants with aphasia and AOS, authors  reported positive effects for PROMPT in improving production of target words and phrases and trained and untrained declarative sentences.(40,41) Data regarding generalization effects and social validity are lacking \u2013Phonomotor rehabilitation:  The phonomotor approach incorporates principles designed for treatment for dyslexia in children (Lindamood Phoneme Sequencing Program).(42) The rationale for using this approach is based on the assumption that AOS is a motor level disorder and that the impairment stems from the inability to retrieve and sequence previously learned motor patterns.(43) The treatment includes two main phases: 1) the pre-practice  phase, in which the patient studies oral movements that are depicted in treatment pictures (line drawings of articulatory placement), and 2) the acquisition phase, in which the target stimulus (sound) is presented in nonwords in conditions that optimize motor learning. Sounds are presented with their corresponding line drawings and practiced with auditory discrimination tasks, verbal production tasks, and tactile/kinesthetic tasks. Self-evaluation and \u201cmental practice\u201d are also key components of the program. The patient is asked to use a mirror to evaluate whether sounds are correct or incorrect. In a multiple baseline single-subject design study investigating the effects of the phonomotor approach, the patient with AOS showed improvements on individual phoneme production but no improvements in multisyllabic words or discourse production(43) \u2013Speech Motor Learning (SML) approach : The SML approach was developed to address not only specific sound errors but also inter-segment transitionalization (transitioning between sounds), coarticulation, temporal flow of speech, recall of motor plans and programs for long utterances, and automated production of practiced speech utterances.(44) The overall aim is to help the individual with apraxia regain control of motor planning and become a more natural speaker. Unique features of this approach include rating the ease of production of specific consonants, vowels, and diphthongs by the patient and therapist prior to treatment, the use of nonwords for practice, and stages of treatment which increase in difficulty with respect to sounds targeted as well as syllable structures. There is limited research on the effectiveness of using principles of motor learning for the rehabilitation of AOS; however, the small body of research is promising and warrants additional studies(71) -In a multiple baseline single-participant  design across behaviors study in South Africa, researchers investigated the effectiveness of the SML approach in a 54-year-old  individual with apraxia secondary to a stroke.(44) Prior to the study, the patient had received treatment with specific error sounds in nonwords and his speech had reached a plateau. He started receiving SML treatment 30 months post onset of stroke. Treatment was conducted twice a week for 18 months for a total of 89 1-hour  sessions. Results indicated improvement with production of untrained nonwords and words containing the trained and untrained speech motor targets. The number of speech errors decreased across the treatment period and improvement was maintained 2 years post treatment \u2013Motor Learning Guided (MLG) approach:  An approach based on learned motor programs (such as riding a bike or typing on a keyboard) that has been modified for use in therapy for AOS(45) -Based on the following principles:(45) -Repetitive drills are essential motor learning tools -Instruction for motor skill should involve a model of the appropriate motor pattern -Self-learning  is important; motor learning should not be structured in an errorless fashion -Feedback guides the patient to correct his or her mistakes and will help increase accuracy over time -Two types of feedback can be provided: knowledge of results (KR) and knowledge of performance (KP) -KR: informs patient about accuracy (e.g., \u201cYou got 9 of 10 correct\u201d) -KP: provides patient with specific information about his or her performance (e.g., \u201cYour tongue was placed too far forward that time\u201d) -The skill being practiced should be very similar to or exactly the same as the target skill -Selection of treatment stimuli -In speech-language  therapy, it is essential to train patients to use functional words, phrases, and sentences(46) -In a study conducted in the United States, researchers found high social validity among 124 unfamiliar listeners when listening to a patient who had been treated according to a modified script training protocol in which the patient selected personally meaningful phrases to practice in treatment sessions(46) -Authors of a literature review for AOS treatments strongly recommend beginning with syllables as the initial targets because syllables are such overlearned motor patterns and therefore are more likely to produce early success in"
