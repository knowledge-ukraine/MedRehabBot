Individuals who are less affected may be included in the spectrum with diagnoses such as fetal alcohol effects, prenatal alcohol effects, alcohol-related birth defects, and alcohol-related  neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND)",

Interventions for improving social skills showed consistently strong results \u2013Of all the studies included, only 19 were rated as \u201cstrong\u201d in study design and none received a \u201cstrong\u201d rating for selection bias or blinding \u2013Studies with randomization (RCT) are lacking.
