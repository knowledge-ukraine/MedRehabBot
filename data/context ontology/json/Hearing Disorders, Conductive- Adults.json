Typically, for a conductive hearing loss, a hearing aid or amplification system needs to allow for sound to bypass the outer and middle ear and be delivered directly to the inner ear via the boneA hearing aid that amplifies sound by carrying it through the bone in the skull, bypassing the external and middle ear(5)Surgically implanted devices that use an abutment embedded in the skull to transmit sound by direct conduction through bone to the inner ear, bypassing the external auditory canal and middle ear(5,6,7) -Authors of a systematic review found 11 observational studies on bone-anchored  hearing aids for individuals with bilateral permanent conductive hearing loss that met inclusion criteria for data extraction and analysis. Results of the systematic review indicated that bilateral bone-anchored  hearing aids provided greater objective and subjective benefit compared to unilateral bone-anchored  hearing aids. Researchers noted that there was a limited number of studies available with good-quality  evidence; hence further research was recommended(22) -In a study conducted in China, researchers investigated the efficacy of unilateral bone-anchored  hearing aids in Mandarin-speaking  patients with bilateral aural atresia. Researchers reviewed the charts of 16 patients aged 6 to 28 years with bilateral conductive hearing loss resulting from bilateral aural atresia who underwent implantation of unilateral bone-anchored  hearing aids. Postoperative tests of hearing indicated an overall mean improvement of 38.3 dB, which was a statistically significant improvement(24)The Vibrant Soundbridge (VSB) is a middle = ear implant system that consists of an externally worn audio processor and a surgically implanted component that consists of two parts, the vibrating ossicular prosthesis (VORP) and the floating mass transducer (FMT). Authors of a systematic review that included 19 studies on the VSB concluded that it was both safe and effective for treatment of conductive hearing loss due to middle-ear  pathology(17) \u2013Cochlear implants are sometimes helpful for patients with permanent forms of conductive hearing loss. A cochlear implant is a device that provides direct electrical stimulation to the auditory nerve of the inner ear.
