            "Glycogen storage disease type II or Pompe disease is a rare lysosomal storage disorder which results in the accumulation of glycogen.(8) Glycogen is a carbohydrate (called a polysaccharide) synthesized in humans in order to be used for fuel and structural support or metabolized for energy.(1) Glycogen is stored almost entirely in the liver and the muscles and is the primary source of stored energy for muscle activity during exercise.(1) In Pompe disease, there is a deficiency of the acid alpha-1,4-glucosidase,  an enzyme that breaks down glycogen in lysosomes (the part of a cell that holds enzymes).(1)As a result of the body\u2019s inability to breakdown the glycogen it accumulates in the muscles, resulting in progressive weakness of skeletal and respiratory muscles; other organs also are affected, thus warranting classification of the disease as a multisystem disorder.(7)Late-onset  Pompe disease (LOPD) is characterized by onset between 12 months and adulthood,whereas infantile Pompe (IOPD) is characterized by onset before 12months.(7)(For detailed information on infantile Pompe disease, see Clinical Review\u2026Glycogen Storage Disease Type II (Infantile Pompe Disease)  ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T709205.).The following is a list of organ involvement and clinical manifestations in LOPD(7):",

In a multicenter study of 90 children and adults with LOPD, 60 received ERT and 30 received placebo over the course of 78 weeks. All patients were ambulatory and free ofinvasive ventilation at baseline. Inclusion criteria were the ability to walk at least 40 m and functional vital capacity (FVC) in upright position between 30 and 80% of normal. The alglucosidase alfatreated  patients showed improvements in walking  distance (6minute  walk test) and stabilization of respiratory function. The trial also revealed a great deal ofvariability in the response to treatment, and some patients continued to deteriorate despite therapy. No data on improvement in swallowing dysfunction were reported(9) In a systematic review and meta-analysis  on the benefit of ERT, Dornelles et al. reported that ERT effectively increases the distance achieved in 6MWT, improves the physical component of QOL, and may decrease time on ventilation (TOV) in treated patients. Functional capacity as measured by FVC was not confirmed. The treatment was deemed to be safe in the studied population, with generally mild adverse events only. No data on swallowing function were included(12) A high-protein  diet and medically supervised exercise therapy are often recommended as part of the treatment plan for patients with Pompedisease(1,3,9) The goal is to decrease glycogen accumulation, increase muscle fatty acid utilization, and compensate for the increased amino acid oxidation that has been shown to occur in Pompedisease(2)",

With consideration for chronologic age and developmental level, the patient may be observed swallowing different consistencies using a variety of feeding vessels.(15) An SLP can obtain information regarding oral phase skills but minimal information can be reported regarding pharyngeal swallow physiology during a CSE given the inherent limitations of the evaluation. Additionally, given limited data regarding validated clinical signs of aspiration in pediatrics and the high incidence of \u201csilent\u201d aspiration, instrumental assessments often are warranted for children with suspected dysphagia.(17)In adults, a high incidence of silent aspiration has also been reported in patients with bulbar involvement.

However, there is no universally accepted assessment tool. Scales, surveys, and checklists that do not include normative data, validation, or guidelines for interpretation should be used with caution.

A VFSS is most often completed in collaboration with a radiologist.(14) Procedure and interpretation guidelines for completing VFSSs in infants and children are described by Arvedson and Lefton-Greif.(37) For adults, guidelinesoriginally developed by JerilynLogeman and more recently modified by Bonnie Martin-Harris  are typically recommended.(37) In children, the assessment must be age-appropriate with regard to positioning, feeding vessels, and viscosity of materials.(14) The patient is presented with a variety of developmentally appropriate liquids and solids mixed with barium while images are recorded. In adults, typically the exam begins with liquids and progresses to thicker viscosities. The SLP describes oral and pharyngeal swallow physiology, assesses airway protection, and determines the effectiveness of any therapeutic strategy/intervention, including viscosity changes.(14) In contrast to the CSE, the VFSS provides critical information on the pharyngeal phase of the swallow and airway protection.(16) Due to the potential harmful effects of ionizing radiation on children, a repeat VFSS should be completed only after careful consideration.(16) With regard to LOPD, it is recommended that a VFSS be included in any gastrointestinal(14,16,37) Labial seal/closure Sucking Tongue-cupping/tongue  tip elevation for bolus formation/control -Mastication -Anterior-posterior  lingual movement for transport -Initiation of the pharyngeal swallow response -Soft palate elevation and retraction -Anterior hyoid excursion (older children/adolescents/adults) -Laryngeal elevation (older children/adolescents/adults) -Epiglottic inversion (toddlers/children/adolescents/adults) -Laryngeal closure -Pharyngeal stripping wave -Tongue base retraction -Pharyngoesophageal segment opening -Esophageal clearanceModified Barium SwallowT709077  \u2013There are limited studiesavailable that report finding of VFSS performed on patientswith LOPD. However, onestudy (case -In a retrospective study that followed LOPD patients over a 10-year  period, 3 of 12 patients had symptoms of oropharyngeal dysphagia. VFSS completed on these three patients found slow anterior-posterior  oral transit, impaired pharyngeal stripping, and post-swallow  pharyngeal residue. One patient demonstrated frequent penetration and occasional aspiration.(11) Additionally, fatigue of jaw muscles resulting in difficultychewing food wasreportedT709077ModifiedT709046For both children and adults, FEES is performed to evaluate the anatomy and physiology of the pharynx and larynx, the patient\u2019s ability to manage secretions, and the patient\u2019s ability to swallow foods and liquids.(14,40) In addition, it can be used to explore a variety of diagnostic interventions such as postures, maneuvers, consistency changes, and flow rate alterations.(36,40) As with the VFSS, age-appropriate  modifications need to be incorporated into the procedure for children. Food may be dyed to enhance visibility. FEES is preferred over VFSS when safety issues related to radiation exposure are present. Due to the invasive nature of the procedure, it is sometimes difficult to obtain accurate representation of a normal swallow in young children; therefore, patient selection is important.(22,39)ASHA in conjunction with the American Board of Swallowing and Swallowing Disorders have published the Dysphagia Competency Verification Tool (DCVT) to assist training SLPs to perform FEES(23)Flexible Endoscopic EvaluationT709038 and  Clinical Review\u2026Dysphagia AssessmentT709141Oximetry is used to evaluate hemoglobin oxygen saturation levels before, during, and after feeding. Most children have an oxygen saturation level of at least 95%. Low saturation levels (below 90%) could indicate some degree of hypoxia. At present, there is mixed evidence on the utility of pulse oximetry as a reliable method of detecting aspiration during clinical feeding evaluation. This tool should be used in conjunction with other types of swallowing measures and results interpreted with caution(42)Cervical auscultation is a portable, noninvasive technique that involves the use of a stethoscope on the lateral side of the thyroid cartilage to detect cervical sounds generated during swallowing and breath sounds pre and post-swallow.
