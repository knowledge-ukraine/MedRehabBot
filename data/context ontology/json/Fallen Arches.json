            "Pes planus (also called flatfoot) is characterized by a flattened, pronated foot in the subtalar neutral position(1)",
            "Clinicians must differentiate between congenital and acquired pes planus and between flexible and rigid pes planus(18) \u2013Congenital pes planus commonly presents as calcaneovalgus flexible flatfoot, a benign functional form that does not necessarily require treatment. In contrast, rigid congenital flatfoot (also called rocker-bottom  foot or congenital vertical talus) usually is dysfunctional and difficult to treat, often requiring surgical correction(2) \u2013Patients with acquired pes planus usually present with an abducted forefoot and valgus hindfoot (i.e., calcaneal eversion, valgus deformity, and increased rearfoot angle). Weakened function of the medial longitudinal arch (MLA) usually is found. In severe cases, the MLA and navicular tuberosity height may collapse toward the floor on weight-bearing  (WB). Insufficiency or dysfunction of the posterior tibial (tibialis) tendon and laxity of the capsular/ligamentous structures of the foot contribute to chronic hyperpronation on WB(11,12)",
            "Whether to treat patients with asymptomatic pes planus (acquired flatfoot) is controversial.(2)In general, if there are no rheumatologic, neuromuscular, genetic, or collagen conditions present, conservative treatment is suggested(18)"
