        "Prevention strategies for CKD include control of hypertension and diabetes mellitus (if present) and avoidance of unnecessary potentially nephrotoxic drugs, especially NSAIDs",
        "The efficacy of erythropoietin in the treatment of anemia in patients with CKD is well established in the literature. Recombinant erythropoietin improves patients\u2019 sense of well-being,  enhances cognitive function, reduces LVH, improves sleep pattern, and reduces hospitalizations(1)",
        "Once a patient develops stage V CKD, the preferred option is transplantation; however, this may not be feasible. A patient may have comorbidities that preclude transplantation, there may be no readily available living related or unrelated donor, and the patient may have to wait 3\u20134 years or more for a cadaver kidney. Therefore, the decision for dialysis is made. Rigorous counseling should be provided to the patient and family/caregivers about the choices available for dialysis access(1,27) Children will have a much better chance at improving their growth, life expectancy, and overall QOL if they are able to undergo kidney transplantation rather than receive ongoing dialysis(31)",
        "Regular aerobic and resistance exercise improves exercise tolerance, cardiovascular function, muscle function, ability to engage in daily physical activities, and QOL(3) It is important to educate both the patient and the family/primary caregivers on the benefits of daily physical activity in order to maximize the patient\u2019s compliance with the exercise program(9,28) Primary caregivers need to play a key role in motivating the patient and assisting him or her to comply with the exercise program(9,28)",
        "In pediatric populations, urinary screening at 3 years of age and throughout school age is considered to contribute to the discovery of CKD at an early stage, thus facilitating early management and improving the renal prognosis(31)",
        "Routine screening for complications of CKD is important to reduce morbidity and mortality Children with CKD require follow-up  every 1\u20133 months, depending on level of GFR, to monitor BP, growth, and lab test values 2)",
        "For high-risk  patients, the following may be necessary(1) Annual echocardiography is increasingly being recommended to assess for early development of LVH. An electrocardiography study may also be used, but its sensitivity is limited, particularly for early detection Testing for serum total cholesterol, low-density  lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density  lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, and homocysteine levels is recommended because nearly 50% of individuals with stage V CKD die of cardiovascular disease Regular evaluation by a dietician to screen for malnutrition Screening for fecal occult blood and measurement of iron stores and serum folate",
        "Regarding sports participation, a transplanted kidney is relatively more prone to injury because of its location in the abdomen. Contact sports, such as football, wrestling, martial arts, and boxing, should be avoided. Other activities associated with high-grade  renal injuries are sledding, skiing, and rollerblading(3) Individuals with a kidney transplant have successfully participated in many sports at national and international levels, including track and field, swimming, golf, volleyball, bowling, badminton, tennis, table tennis, running, and cycling",
        "There are many camps in the United States that have been created for children with chronic diseases, including children with CKD and/or status post transplantation. The age range for participation varies, as do cost and dates (many are during the summer). These camps are designed to provide children with chronic illnesses an opportunity to have fun, and participate in a variety of sporting activities (hiking, horseback riding, swimming, fishing, tennis, etc.) as well as crafts, music, and the arts in a safe, stress-free,  emotionally supportive environment with their peers. Many of these camps are associated with the National Kidney Foundation and operated in conjunction with state YMCA programs"
