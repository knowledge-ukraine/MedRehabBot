            "Pediatric feeding disorders are defined as oral intake that is not age-appropriate  and with dysfunction noted in at least one of the following  domains: nutrition, medical, feeding skill/safety, and psychosocial.(49) Specifically, dysphagia (feeding skill/safety) refers to difficultyin any of the stages of swallowing: oral, pharyngeal, and/or esophageal.(55)Briefly, the oral phase includes sucking, chewing, and transporting the bolus into the pharynx. The pharyngeal phase is defined by initiation of the swallow response, pharyngeal clearance, and airway closure to prevent aspiration (food or liquid entering the airway) or choking.(47) Lastly, the esophageal phase consists of the opening of the upper esophageal sphincter and transit down the esophagus via peristaltic motion to the stomach.(47)Dysphagia in individuals with CP is multifaceted and typically results from poor coordination and control of the muscles involved in swallowing.(40) Children with CP typically experience problems in at least one, and usually more than one, phase of swallowing.(40) Due to oral motor impairments, children with CP are most at risk for impairments in the oral phase of swallowing.(2) Pharyngeal phase impairments are also common and might include nasal aspiration, delayed swallow initiation, laryngeal penetration, aspiration before and after swallow, and cricopharyngeal dysfunction.(2) In addition, dysphagia symptoms are often exacerbated by the presence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which is common among children with CP.(42) The following are commonly reported oral and pharyngeal phase swallowing symptoms in children with CP:(2)",

Children with spastic quadriplegia have weak and stiff muscles and have themost severe functional impairments.(5) Children with spastic quadriplegia are most at risk for swallowing disorders dueto their dependency on others for feeding, difficulties with communication, and associated problems such as epilepsy andpostural problems.(2) Health complications due to swallowing difficulties include aspiration pneumonia, chronic lungdisease, and malnutrition(6)"

Scales, surveys, and checklists are commonly used in the clinical examination but often do not include normative data or the normative data conflict(52,53). SLP knowledge of normal oral motor development and feeding function is essential when evaluating infants and children.(2)A CSE cannot definitively confirm the presence or absence of aspiration. In a study using surface electromyography and respiratory inductance plethysmography comparing 11 children with spastic cerebral palsy (mean age 7 years) to 10 similar age controls, children with CP displayed heighted suprahyoid muscle activity for puree and chewables, and noted to utilize post-swallow  inhalation across consistencies(56). For detailed information on a CSE for children, see  Clinical Review\u2026In-depth  Bedside Swallow Examination (Pediatrics ); CINAHL Topic ID Number -In a systematic review of objective measures for oropharyngeal dysphagia, authors identified 9 objective measures with published psychometric data in children with CP or other neurodevelopmental disabilities aged 12 months to 5 years. The validity of each of these measures (for children with CP) was assessed and found to be low.(33)Additionally, other systematic reviews of the psychometric characteristics of noninstrumental swallowing measures noted incomplete data or conflicting findings. Due to this, these measures should be used with caution.(52,53)The following is a list ofAn instrument that assesses oral-motor  function across a wide range of food textures and fluids for preverbal childrenA subset of the Multidisciplinary Feeding Profile, a statistically based protocol for patients who are dependent feeders. Scaled ratings are made for posture, tone, reflexes, general motor control, orofacial structures, orofacial sensory input, orofacial motor control, and ventilation(15)A standardized screening survey that can be used with children from 2 years of age to adults. Assesses BMI, restrictions in food textures and viscosity, dependence in feeding, and need for special utensils or positioning. Provides information on the severity of the swallowing disorder and can be used as an outcome measure(18)Consists of 0- to 10-point hierarchical scales designed for rapid assessment of gross, fine, and oral motor skills(34)This scale measures variations of 9 feeding-related behaviors (e.g., jaw closure, lip closure, swallowing, tongue control, chewing skills). Behaviors are rated on a scale from 0 (totally passive response) to 5 (functionally normal response)(16)A scale consisting of 6 feeder behaviors and 14 child behaviors; each behavior is scored as \u201cnormal,\u201d \u201cmarginal,\u201d or \u201cinadequate\u201d(33) An ordinal scale with scores of 0 (passive) to 3 (normal); scores 7 behaviors(33)A rating scale that examines swallowing and voice in children up to 2 years of age. Ratings include duration of the meal, amount of intake, food consistencies, positioning, sucking from a nipple, sipping from a cup, and coordination of suck-swallow-breathe(13) -In a study conducted in Australia with 130 children with CP aged 18 to 36 months, researchers investigated which measures of dysphagia were the best for discriminating between children with and without oropharyngeal dysphagia. Researchers evaluated the SOMA, DDS, and PSAS and found that all three measures had strong agreement with respect to inter-  and intrarater reliability. In this study, the SOMA was found to have the best specificity (100.0%) but lacked sensitivity (53.0%), and both the DDS and PSAS had high sensitivity (each 100.0%) but lower specificity (47.1% and 70.6%, respectively).(39)Again, these measures should be used with caution. -Additional measures of swallowing abilityEvaluation of an infant\u2019s ability to suck on a bottle and/or breast.

The tool correlates with the Gross Motor Function Classification System(55)A VFSS is performed when the dysphagia team has concerns about the pharyngeal phase of swallowing and the complete swallowing sequence. A VFSS is completed in collaboration with a physician (radiologist).(47) Most clinical practices follow the protocol originally described by Logemann;(20) adaptations of this protocol for infants and children are described in Arvedson and Lefton-Greif(21) -The assessment must be age appropriate with regard to positioning and presentation and viscosity of material.(47) The patient eats and drinks a variety of developmentally appropriate liquids and solids mixed with barium while images are recorded with videofluorography.

The SLP assesses oral-pharyngeal  swallow physiology, documents airway invasion, and describes the effectiveness of presenting different food consistencies or modifying posture.(47) In contrast to the CSE, a VFSS provides critical information on the pharyngeal phase of the swallow (e.g., movement of the hyolaryngeal complex, confirmation of the presence of aspiration)(22) -Given the unnatural surroundings, swallowing function observed during a VFSS is not necessarily identical to that present at mealtimes.(47) Other variables that influence swallowing function include anxiety, fatigue, and medications(23) -Due to the potential harmful effects of ionizing radiation on children, a repeat VFSS should be considered only when there are specific questions that require answers from a repeat study(5)ModifiedT709077 (23) -Lip closure (ability to contain a liquid bolus) -Lingual elevation (the back of the tongue is slightly elevated) -Tongue-to-palatal  seal -Bolus preparation/mastication -Bolus transport/movement of the tongue (movement of the bolus to the back of the oral cavity) -Initiation of the pharyngeal swallow (swallow should be initiated when the bolus reaches the region of the posterior oral cavity) -Soft palate elevation and retraction -Laryngeal elevation -Anterior hyoid excursion (depending on age) -Pharyngeal contraction -Pharyngoesophageal segment opening -Tongue base retraction -Epiglottic inversion -Esophageal clearanceFEES is performed to evaluate the anatomy and physiology of the pharynx and larynx, the patient\u2019s ability to manage secretions, and the patient\u2019s ability to swallow foods and liquids.(48) In addition, it can be used to explore a variety of diagnostic interventions such as postures, maneuvers, consistency changes, and flow rate alterations.(24) As with the VFSS, age-appropriate modifications need to be incorporated into the procedure. Food may be dyed to enhance visibility. FEES is preferred over VFSS when patients have safety issues related to radiation exposure or when they need retesting. Due to the invasive nature of the procedure, it is sometimes difficult to obtain cooperation inyoung children; therefore, patient selection is important. ASHA in conjunction with the American Board of Swallowing and Swallowing Disorders has published several online documents, including the Dysphagia Competency Verification Tool (DCVT) relevant to the technical aspects of FEES and the qualifications required to perform FEES.(46)See  Clinical Review\u2026Dysphagia",

            "In a prospective, longitudinal representative cohort study conducted in Australia with 170 children with CP who were assessed on 396 different occasions, researchers found that parent-reported attainment of eating ability was significantly associated with gross motor functional ability as measured by the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) (a scale used by PTs to assess gross motor skills).(35) The ability of children with CP to consume foods with advanced textures (e.g., ground, lumpy, cut-up,  chunky, all textures) was the best for children whose GMFCS score was level I and then progressively decreased as the GMFCS score decreased(35)",
            "In a longitudinal study conducted in Australia with 53 children with CP, researchers assessed swallowing ability at some point between 18 and 24 months of age and again at 36 months of age. Researchers found that the severity and presence of dysphagia in this group of children was relatively stable between time points. There was an improvement in or resolution of dysphagia observed in children with a GMFCS score of I (i.e., those with ambulatory CP). In children with GMFCS scores between II and V , dysphagia did not resolve, but did improve in about 1/3 of this group. Overall, researchers found an increased risk of dysphagia and increased severity of dysphagia with higher GMFCS scores (i.e., lower gross motor abilities)(45)",
            "In a longitudinal study conducted in Australia with 179 children ages 18 -60 months, dysphagia reduced from 79% at 18-24 months to 43% at 60 months. There were decreasing odds of dysphagia as age increased but increasing odds with poorer gross motor skills. Dysphagia decreased in ambulatory children with CP as age increased.(54)"

        "referral to other disciplines": "Dysphagia assessment and treatment is best performed using a team approach. The following professionals are often involved in the management of swallowing dysfunction in children in medical settings: SLP, nurse, lactation consultant, early childhood nurse, dietician, pediatrician, OT, PT, gastroenterologist, neurologist, and social worker.(2) School-based  teams for dysphagia management might include the parents, an SLP, an OT, a PT, a nurse, a teacher, the school principal, a paraprofessional, the cafeteria manager, a teacher\u2019s aide/assistant, and a social worker(9)",
        "other considerations": [],
        "treatment summary": [
            "Oral sensory motor therapy:  The objectives of oral sensory motor therapy are to increase coordination of oral motor movements to improve feeding skills and/or to increase normal sensory function during mealtimes. Oral sensory motor therapy has been found to increase oral motor function (e.g., chewing, tongue lateralization, lip closure), but research is inconclusive with regard to its effect on oral feeding efficiency, caloric intake, weight gain, pharyngeal motility, and airway protection for children with CP(8,30,31)",
            "Positioning/postural adaptations:  Many children with CP and dysphagia have abnormalities in posture, tone, and movement that influence feeding.(2) In these cases, the SLP might collaborate with a PT and/or OT in providing a seating position that is most beneficial for feeding. Positioning has been found to improve oral and pharyngeal swallowing function in children with CP.(32) Sitting upright for a period of time after eating can decrease the symptoms of GERD \u2013For detailed information on postural modifications for dysphagia treatment, see  Clinical Review\u2026Dysphagia: Swallowing Therapy \u2013Compensatory  ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T903567",
            "Adaptive equipment:  Adaptive equipment for eating and feeding therapy might include specific teats/nipples, bottles, pacifiers, cups, spoons, and forks.(1) The SLP can collaborate with the OT in selecting adaptive equipment for self-feeding",
            "Modification of liquids:  Liquids can be modified (i.e.,thickened) to assist the child in controlling liquids in the oral and pharyngeal phases of the swallow and improve the effectiveness and safety of the swallow after VFSS has been completed. Liquids should not be thickened based solely on CSE. Trials of different liquid consistencies should be performed with instrumental assessments (e.g., VFSS, FEES). Modification of equipment such as bottles and cups is sometimes necessary to accommodate the thickened liquids, and parents/caregivers should receive training and information regarding thickened liquids. Examples of circumstances in which thickened liquids might assist the child include:(2) \u2013pooling of liquid in the oral cavity \u2013poor lip closure and loss of liquid \u2013poor tongue control, movement, and coordination \u2013delayed initiation of the swallow \u2013coughing/choking/gulping \u2013clinical signs of aspiration \u2013history of chest infections \u2013presence of GERD \u2013For detailed information on liquid modifications for dysphagia treatment, see Clinical Review\u2026Dysphagia: Swallowing Therapy \u2013 Compensatory , referenced above",
            "Modification of solid foods:  Solid foods can be modified to assist the child in chewing and controlling the bolus. In addition, recommendations of food consistency and food type must be aligned to the family\u2019s dietary habits and culture. The following guidelines are indicators of age of nutritional readiness and oral skills for solid foods in normal development; however, the child\u2019s individual oromotor/feeding skills and food allergies must be considered when introducing new textures of foods:(2) \u20136 to 8 months \u2013 purees(2) \u20138 to 9 months \u2013 mashed lumpy/mixed textures(2) \u2013Finger food -7 to 8 months onwards \u2013 toast/biscuits(2) -10 to 11 months onwards \u2013 soft chopped food(2) -10 to 12 months onwards \u2013 firm finger foods(2) -15 months onwards \u2013 foods that require sustained biting and chewing(2) \u2013For detailed information on diet modifications for dysphagia treatment, see Clinical Review\u2026Dysphagia: Swallowing Therapy \u2013 Compensatory , referenced above",
            "Feeding tubes (orogastric, nasogastric, gastrostomy, jejunostomy)/enteral feeding:  Children with CP who show signs of undernutrition, aspiration associated with respiratory disease, insufficient fluid intake, and excessive stress during mealtimes might be candidates for a feeding tube to provide an alternative nutritional source.(6) Other considerations include the presence of GERD and caregiver stress associated with mealtimes.(10) Successful long-term  management of enteral feeding depends on coordinated longitudinal care by a dysphagia team. Provision of pleasurable experiences  to the mouth and face has been recommended to prevent the child from becoming orally hypersensitive while receiving nutrition by tube feeding.(2)Evidence for the effectiveness of gastrostomy tube feeding for children with CP is insufficient due to methodological weaknesses of studies and absence of RCTs.(10,44)Authors of a systematic review of the literature performed in 2014 reported that all of the studies that have been conducted regarding the effectiveness of gastrostomy tubes for children with CP have been of children with severe feeding impairment.(44) In these studies, the researchers all report a significant increase in weight associated with the placement of a gastrostomy tube; however, the frequency of surgical complications and adverse events was high.(44) The decision to place a feeding tube is made by the physician and the child\u2019s family based on input from the SLP, OT, nutritionist, and other professionals working with the child . Problem Goal Intervention Expected Progression Home Program  Inadequate oral intake for nutritional needsMeet nutritional needs Supplementation of oral intake _ Children with CP often require a longer duration to feed orally and thus are unable to receive adequate nutrition without supplementation. For a newborn, an oral feed should be completed within 30 to 40 minutes and by 30 minutes for a child about 6 months of age. An SLP might collaborate with a pediatrician or nutritionist to assist the child in meeting nutritional needs orally by documenting the child\u2019s feeding skills (timing, range of foods, and consistencies) to assist in selecting the correct way to supplement _ _ Modifications include: -small, frequent feeds -adding calories to feeds by using commercial additives -adding vitamins, minerals, and nutritional supplements -using nasogastric tube feeding methods in addition to oral feedingThe child will meet nutritional needsFeeding program should be implemented at home/school  Prolonged feeding times due to disruptive feeding environmentModify feeding environment to meet the feeding needs of the childModification of feeding environment _ The physical environment in which a child is being fed can have an impact on the duration of a meal. The feeding environment should be a calm setting in which the child can focus on feeding and swallowing(2)Progression of environmental modifications and specific types of food and liquid consistencies trialed will vary according to patient goalsFeeding program should be implemented at home/school  Abnormalities in the child\u2019s posture/muscle tone that interfere with feedingImprove positioning to attain a more adequate feeding position for the childModification of the child\u2019s posture _ Many children with CP and dysphagia have abnormalities in their posture, tone, and movement that influence feeding.(2) In these cases, the SLP might collaborate with a PT and/or OT in providing a seating position that: -is relaxed and comfortable and allows for a sustainable posture/ position(2) -provides balance, stability, and mobility(2) -is efficient and safe for swallowing(2) -inhibits normal movement patterns that interfere with swallowing(2) -allows for independent feeding if possible -provides for optimal oromotor function and control(2) -reduces likelihood of fatigue for child and caregiver.(2) Examples of positioning modifications for newborns include swaddling, specific positions (side- lying, prone, more upright), and use of positioning aids.(2) For children who are eating solid foods, positioning techniques might include a pelvic strap to stabilize pelvis and hips, a footplate and/or additional foot cuffs, a harness to support the trunk, and head/ neck support with hand or arm.(2) All positioning equipment must be carefully chosen by the skilled members of the dysphagia team and individualized for the needs of the child(2)Progression of postural modifications and specific types of food and liquid consistencies trialed will vary according to patient goalsFeeding program should be implemented at home/school  Feeding difficulties/ dysphagiaIncrease the infant\u2019s or child\u2019s feeding abilitiesAdaptive equipment _ Adaptive equipment for feeding includes specific bottle nipples, bottles, pacifiers, cups, spoons, straws, and forks. When selecting special equipment for feeding, the SLP should consider ways to facilitate improved oral-motor patterns by use of special equipment (e.g., training cup to facilitate lip closure). Other variables to consider when selecting equipment include the child\u2019s: -age and size -oral anatomy -feeding skills -medical status -cognitive development -preferences -feeding goals -motor development -positioning for feeding. In addition, it is important to consider parent preferences as well as the durability, cost, and accessibility of the equipment.(2) A team approach is recommended for selection and trial of adaptive equipment with the child(2)The choice and progression of adaptive equipment as well as the specific types of food and liquid consistencies trialed will vary according to patient goalsFeeding program should be implemented at home  Oral or pharyngeal dysphagia with liquid consistencyIncrease swallowing ability for liquidsModification of liquids _ Children with CP who experience pooling of liquid in the oral cavity, poor lip closure, poor tongue coordination, delayed initiation of oral and pharyngeal phases of swallow, and coughing/choking/ gulping might benefit from thickened liquids. In addition, children who show clinical signs of aspiration or who have a history of respiratory infections might benefit from temporary or long- term use of thickened liquids.(2) The rationale for the use of thickened liquids must be carefully explained to caregivers/parents and confirmed by use of instrumental evaluation. Liquids should not be thickened based solely on CSEProgression of specific types of liquid consistencies trialed will vary according to patient goalsFeeding program should be implemented at home/school Difficulty with control or mastication of bolus in the oral phasesIncrease swallowing ability for solidsModification of solids _ Solid foods might be modified to assist the child in chewing and controlling the bolus.
