            "A modified barium swallow study (MBSS) is a recorded (either on videotape or digital media) fluoroscopic examination of a patient\u2019s swallowing function performed by a speech-language  pathologist (SLP) in conjunction with a radiologist during which a patient is asked to swallow varying amounts of barium mixtures.(1,2)Barium mixtures for an MBSS are prepared with barium sulfate (BaSO 4), which is chemically inactive while it is in the body.(28) Barium sulfate is used because it provides contrast along the digestive tract allowing for the structures of swallowing to be visualized as it passes through the mouth and pharynx.(28)MBSS is used to identify the presence of an oropharyngeal dysphagia as well as the patient\u2019s risk for aspiration.(1,2) Additionally, the SLP can utilize the MBSS to determine and teach appropriate compensatory strategies and/or therapeutic exercises to a patient with dysphagia(1,2)",
