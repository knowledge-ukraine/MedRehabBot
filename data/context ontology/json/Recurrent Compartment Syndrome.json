The ischemia leads to pain, discomfort, paresthesia, and metaboliteaccumulation(1,24)\u2013Muscle that has been injured through repetitious activity on an inflexible surface secretes protein-bound  ions, therebyaltering osmotic pressure. In turn, swelling increases, resulting in inadequate blood flow to the region(8)\u2013Fluid extravasation (leakage into tissue) and increased intracompartmental pressures may contribute to neuralcompression(28)\u2013Decreased capillary density or obstructed venous outflow have also been implicated in the development of chroniccompartment syndrome(28)",
