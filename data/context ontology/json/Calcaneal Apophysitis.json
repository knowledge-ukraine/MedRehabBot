            "Sever\u2019s disease, or calcanealapophysitis, is a repetitive traction injury in children at the growth center of the calcaneus. Occurring during a period of rapid growth, excessive traction from the Achilles tendon can cause micro avulsions where it inserts onto the calcaneus(2)",
            "Sever\u2019s disease is the most common cause of heel pain in active adolescents aged 9\u201312 years old, typically occurring during a period of rapid growth. Risk factors include year-round  sports participation, commonly involving sports that require repetitive running or jumping, poorly fitting footwear, and poor training mechanics. It occurs more frequently in males, occurring at a median age of 12 for males and 11 for females(2)"

Osgood-SchlatterSyndrome  ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T708419)\u2013As a child grows, bones go through different stages of development. The growth center initially is cartilaginous(cartilaginous stage). The growth center then enters the apophyseal stage, during which the secondary ossification center(apophysis) appears. The initial unity of both ends of the growth center marks the epiphyseal stage. Lastly, when thegrowth plates fuse, the bony stage begins\u2013Children are most susceptible to Sever\u2019s disease when their bones are in the apophyseal stage. The apophysis is unableto withstand tensile forces. When presented with strong, repetitive muscle contractions, microavulsion occurs at theimmature area. The separation results in symptoms typical of any form of apophysitis"
