            "A stroke is an acquired injury to the brain caused by either reduced blood supply (i.e., ischemia) leading to infarction (necrosis of brain tissue)(1) or a hemorrhage within the parenchyma of the brain(2,31)",
            "Constraint-induced  movement therapy (CIMT) is a therapeutic intervention for the upper or lower extremity.(3) CIMT is based on learned nonuse, which describes the phenomenon observed in humans (and animals) in which an individual with a hemiparesis feels the negative consequences of the increased effort required to use the affected limb while simultaneously feeling positively reinforced for using compensatory strategies with the unaffected limb.(3) The result is a learned behavior of limb nonuse despite the possibility that the involved limb might physically still be able to perform purposeful motor movements.CIMT was developed to counteract the effects of learned nonuse in patients with acquired neurological damage to an upper extremity(3,4)",
            "Traditional CIMT involves restraining the unaffected (or less-affected)  upper extremity 90% of waking hours over the course of 2\u20136 weeks while performing daily 6-hour training sessions with the affected upper extremity.(3) Due to the intensity of CIMT protocols, it has been linked to poor compliance and reimbursement restrictions(3)",
            "In response to CIMT limitations, modified CIMT (mCIMT) has been adopted as a variation of CIMT that uses a less intensive protocol. A typical mCIMT shortens the training sessions to 30 minutes per day, 3 times per week and reduces the restraint time of the nonaffected extremity to \u02c2 6 hours per day(45)",
            "Although there is some variance in the literature regarding specific protocols and related results, CIMT has been found to be effective during acute rehabilitation (as early as 0\u20133 months post stroke)through chronic stroke (15\u201321  months or greater post stroke) and is most effective with patients who have less severe motor deficits (e.g., ability to initiate movement and with at least 20\u00b0 of wrist extension and 10\u00b0 of digit extension)(3) ICD-10  codes"

Despite the growing body of literature supporting the use of CIMT in survivors of stroke with upper extremity impairment, few private insurance companies reimburse for 6 hours of skilled intervention 5 days per week; Medicare/Medicaid does not reimburse for CIMT(5)",
            "mCIMT is more likely to be reimbursable.(5) Some studies have shown mCIMT to be as effective as CIMT(3)  \u2013It is important to note that there is no standardized or \u201cbest practice\u201d protocol for mCIMT. Many research studies use the term mCIMT; however, there is variability in the frequency and intensity of these programs, so it is difficult for researchers to compare results across studies, for therapists to devise an effective treatment plan, and for payers to provide appropriate reimbursement. Everyone involved in treatment by CIMT/mCIMT, including patients, would benefit from a clearly defined mCIMT protocol(28)"
