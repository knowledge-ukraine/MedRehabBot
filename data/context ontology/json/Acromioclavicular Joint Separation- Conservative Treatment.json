            "The AC joint is subject to varying degrees of injury. While an isolated partial sprain of the AC ligament can occur, more severe cases involve complete tearing of all AC and CC ligaments. In the latter cases, the clavicle is no longer attached to the acromion and the AC joint becomes dislocated, which is also known as a \u201cseparated shoulder.\u201d AC joint separation is commonly described using Rockwood\u2019s classification (RW I\u2013VI), which is based on the degree and direction of clavicular displacement",
