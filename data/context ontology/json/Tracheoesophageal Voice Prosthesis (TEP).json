            "A TEP is a device that is placed into a surgically created fistula in the shared wall that connects the posterior wall of the trachea and the anterior wall of the esophagus.(1) This wall is referred to as the \u201cparty wall.\u201d(1) Such a fistula is referred to as a tracheoesophageal puncture.(2) When the patient\u2019s stoma (the opening in the neck following a laryngectomy through which a patient breathes) is covered, expiratory air is directed from the lungs through the TEP into the esophagus, vibrating the pharyngoesophageal segment and surrounding tissues to create a sound source for speech.(1,2,3,4,5,6) TEPs are one-way  valves that prevent the puncture from sealing up and also keep food and liquid out of the trachea(3,5)"
