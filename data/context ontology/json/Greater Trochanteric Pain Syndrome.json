            "Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) is a chronic pain syndrome defined as tenderness to palpation around the bony prominence of the greater trochanter of the hip. GTPS may be associated with myofascial pain such as tendinopathy, trigger points, tears of the gluteus medius and minimus muscles and tendons, ITB disorders, or general pathology in surrounding tissues. In contrast, trochanteric bursitis implies the presence of inflammation and swelling in the bursae only(1,2,3)"
