            "Functional capacity evaluation (FCE) is an umbrella term that refers to a set of tests and observations that evaluate a person\u2019s physical ability to perform work activities related to his or her participation in employment(1)",
            "The International Classification ofFunctioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) provides standard language that can be universally applied to what classifies health and disability. Tools such as FCEs draw upon its classifications to assist in assessing varying aspects of health such as work functioning(32)",

            "Some employers may be required by law to administer an FCE before an employee can return to work, and some insurers may require an FCE before insurance payments can be made. FCEs are also used to determine eligibility for disability insurance payments or pension eligibility when an employee is permanently unable to return to work(3)",

Three studies evaluated healthy subjects, and the health status of subjects in 1 study was unclear -The Valpar Joule FCE has high interrater reliability, with an intraclass correlation (ICC) of > 0.90when tested on healthy adults(28) \u2013A short-form  hand FCE protocol has been found reliable compared to the full-length  protocol in healthy subjects(16)",
            "Validity \u2013A review of several types of FCEs found variable results, but most showed moderate to good validity(33) -The WorkWell FCE has been shown to have modest predictive validity for return to work (RTW) in claimants with back and upper extremity (UE) injuries, but does not predict future injury occurrence(2) -Criterion-related  validity of the Ergo-Kit  FCE was found to be moderate to poor in a study of the concurrent and predictive validity (the 2 components of criterion-related  validity) in construction workers(9) -Concurrent validity was tested against the Instrument for Disability Risk, a tool for identifying construction workers at risk for disability, since no gold standard exists to which the FCE can be compared -Concurrent validity with future disability risk was poor for 2 of 5 specific lifting tasks and moderate for the other 3 -Predictive validity on durable RTW was poor -The authors concluded that the expectation that FCEs measuring current physical work ability have prognostic value for future work-related  concepts may be unrealistic \u2013Predictive value of FCE tests improves as the occupational or physical demands approach or exceed the worker\u2019s capability(4)  \u2013Construct validity was also confirmed for a majority of FCE tests (handgrip strength, lifting waist to overhead, overhead working, and repetitive reaching) in patients with WADs with cultural differences in a workers\u2019 compensation setting(25) \u2013Authors of a 2013 study of the construct validity of FCE tests examined relationships between FCE tests and ICF factors(10) -In a sample of 403 healthy workers, material-handling FCE tests were related to physical factors but not to psychosocial factors tested -Only 5\u201315%  of static (postural) FCE test results were explained by physical or psychosocial factors -The construct of static work FCE tests remains largely unexplained \u2013In a study conducted in Israel, there was higher agreement between the determined degree of disability based on medical examination alone and a combined medical examination and FCE in a population of patients with hip injury following traffic accident than in a group with WADs(17) \u2013More validity research is needed, but evidence for the predictive ability of short-form  FCEs for RTW of injured workers is promising(4) \u2013Job-specific  FCEs show better predictive validity in relation to the RTW of patients with a specific injury, such as a distal radius fracture, than in relation to the RTW of patients with a nonspecific injury(11)",
            "Internal consistency \u2013The examination typically uses repeated measures to account for effort and behavioral discrepancies(3) \u2013Intra-test  inconsistency that exceeds normal error values is assumed to be an indicator of less than full effort if the test has been administered properly -Identification of measures of related attributes has allowed standards for inter-test  comparisons to be developed as indicators of effort. Absence of expected relationships among related measures suggests less than full effort \u2013Some FCEs, such as the WorkWell, require testing on 2 consecutive days. Some items are tested twice. The need for repeated testing was investigated in a study conducted in the Netherlands involving subjects with early osteoarthritis(12) -Acceptable 2-day  consistency was found on 3 repeated test items: lifting low, lifting overhead, and carrying -The need for repeated testing on 2 consecutive days could not be confirmed",

Most of the pain was muscle soreness, with upper legs, lower back, shoulders, and upper arms being the most common locations \u2013Symptoms decreased to pre-FCE  levels in a mean of 3 days \u2013The pain response of healthy subjects, measured by its intensity and duration, was not significantly different from the response of patients with chronic low back pain \u2013It was concluded that a pain response following an FCE can be expected and is a normal musculoskeletal reaction",
