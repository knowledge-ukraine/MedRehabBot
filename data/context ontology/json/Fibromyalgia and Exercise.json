            "Whole-body  vibration (WBV) combined with an exercise program may improve balance in women with FM(15) \u2013Based on an RCT in Spain involving 30 women with FM who participated in an exercise program in addition to WBV or an exercise program only \u2013The exercise program consisted of aerobic and strengthening exercises twice a week for approximately 1 hour per session \u2013The women in the WBV group participated in 3 days of WBV in addition to the exercise program \u2013The women in the WBV group had a greater improvement in balance than the control group",
            "Based on an RCT in the United States, tai chi (a Chinese technique of mind-focused  movements) shows promise as an alternative form of exercise for improving FM symptoms(16) \u2013Sixty-six  patients were randomized to the tai chi (TC) group that practiced 12 weeks (twice a week for 60 minutes per session) or a control group  \u2013FIQ scores decreased significantly more in the TC group (18.4 points) compared to the control group (9.4 points) at 12 weeks \u2013Physical and mental domains of the SF-36  improved significantly more in the TC group vs. controls \u2013Improvements were maintained at 24-week  follow-up \u2013No adverse events were observed",
            "Based on a study in Sweden, pain and fear avoidance partially explained change in knee-extension  force, elbow-flexion force, and handgrip force in patients with FM during a resistance exercise program(43) \u2013Subjects were67 women with fibromyalgia (age range 25\u201364 years) \u2013The authors suggested that pain and fear avoidance need to be considered in the rehabilitation of a patient with FM",
            "Based on an RCT in Turkey, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  (HPA) axis dysfunction may contribute to symptoms of FM, which may improve with exercise(32) \u2013Subjects included 50 patients with FM and were randomized into group 1 (stretching and flexibility exercises at home) or group 2 (aerobic exercise in addition to the group 1 protocol) \u2013Exercises were performed for a duration of 6 weeks \u2013Serum levels of cortisol, insulin-like  growth factor-1, growth hormone, and adrenocorticotropic hormone were analyzed at baseline, 1 hour after an exercise stress test, and at the end of the 6-week  protocol \u2013Subjects were assessed for pain, tender points, fatigue, morning stiffness, functional disability, cardiovascular fitness, and health-related  quality of life \u2013Group 2 showed greater improvement in morning stiffness and pain. A significant increase in growth hormone levels was found after intervention. A significant decrease in cortisol levels was found in both groups. No significant difference was found in adrenocorticotropic hormone and insulin-like growth factor-1",
            "Data from an RCT in the United States suggest that there is a linear relationship between steps taken per day and health outcomes in patients with FM. Walking an additional 1,000 steps per day was associated with improved physical function. No adverse effects with respect to pain were noted(33)"

        "treatment summary": [
            "According to Canadian guidelines, physical therapy treatment for patients with FM includes the following:(23) \u2013Patient education regarding self-management  and energy conservation \u2013An exercise program that includes cardiovascular, strengthening, and stretching components \u2013Expectation of a high dropout rate: guidelines suggested that only 53% of patients attended more than one-third  of classes \u2013Comparing exercise vs. control -35% vs. 18% rated symptoms and function as much better or very much better at 3 months -38% vs. 22% rated symptoms and function as much better or very much better at 1 year -45% vs. 66% met diagnostic criteria for FM at 1 year",
            "Based on a systematic review, moderate intensity aerobic and aquatic exercise done at least twice a week for 30\u201360  minutes a day has been found to increase functional aerobic capacity, which may help with activities of daily living in patients with fibromyalgia(39)",
            "Supervised aerobic exercise training may improve global well-being and physical function in patients with FM(5) \u2013Based on a Cochrane systematic review of 34 randomized trials with a total of 2,276 patients \u2013Aerobic exercise training at recommended intensity levels was associated with -improved global well-being  (4 trials with 269 patients) -improved physical function (4 trials with 225 patients) -reduced depression (4 trials with 233 patients) -nonsignificant trend towards reduced pain (3 trials with 183 patients) -nonsignificant trend towards reduced tender points (5 trials with 293 patients)",
            "Results of a 2010 systematic review and meta-analysis  analyzing the efficacy of different types of aerobic exercise in FM showed that aerobic exercise reduces pain, fatigue, and depressed mood and improves health-related  quality of life (HRQOL) and physical fitness, and that there is no evidence for superiority of water-based  over land-based  exercise(28) \u2013Twenty-eight  RCTs comparing aerobic exercise with controls and 7 RCTs comparing different types of aerobic exercise, with a total of 2,494 patients, were included \u2013Subgroup analyses of different types of exercise were limited because few studies reported a detailed exercise protocol \u2013Males were included in very few of the studies \u2013Combining aerobic exercise with stretching or strengthening is no more effective than aerobic exercise alone  \u2013Aerobic exercise has no positive effect on sleep \u2013Continuing exercise is necessary to maintain positive effects on pain",
            "Based on a 2015 systematic review, muscle strengthening activity can be a safe and effective mode of exercise for patients with FM(38) \u2013Eleven comparative controlled trials were selected for review \u2013Studies selected included a strength training component as part of the intervention and reported strength and/or pain"
