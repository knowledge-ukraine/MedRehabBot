            "Depression is a common psychological condition, affecting up to 30% of primary care patients.(1) Depression is even more common among older adults (age 65+); however, it can be difficult to accurately diagnose in this population due to medical comorbidities.(2) Depression is a primary mood disorder.(1,2,3) The diagnosis of depression is made when symptoms (e.g., depressed mood, decreased pleasure in activities) are present every day for a 2-week  period and constitute a change from prior level of functioning.(2,4,19) One key feature of mood disorders is that the patient cannot control the severity of his or her feelings.(3) Depression in older adults can result in decreased independence and quality of life, functional decline and disability, and a worsening of overall health and/or chronic medical conditions(5,13)",
            "According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , 5th edition ( DSM -5), depressive disorders include disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, major depressive disorder, dysthymia, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, substance/medication-induced depressive disorder, depressive disorder due to another medical condition, and unspecified depressive disorder(16)",
            "There are four major types of depression, with overlapping symptoms in each group(1) 1.Adjustment disorder with depressed mood -Depression occurring in reaction to an identifiable stressor or difficult life situation -Onset is within 3 months of the incident; the depression causes significant impairment of social and/or occupational functioning 2.Depressive disorders -Major depressive disorder (MDD)(1) -Involves at least one episode of serious mood depression that occurs at any time of life(1) -Symptoms will vary significantly between patients; however, common complaints include loss of interest and/or pleasure in previously enjoyable activities (anhedonia), withdrawal from activities, and feelings of guilt (1,2) -Subcategories include major depression with atypical features; major depression with seasonal onset (seasonal affective disorder [SAD]); and major depression with postpartum onset (usually occurs within 2 weeks to 6 months postpartum)(1)  -Dysthymia(1) -Chronic depressive disturbance -Symptoms include sadness, loss of interest in previously enjoyable activities, and withdrawal from activities over a period of 2 or more years with a relatively persistent course -Symptoms are milder but longer-lasting  than in MDD -Premenstrual dysphoric disorder(1) -Depressive symptoms occur during the late luteal phase (last 2 weeks) of the patient\u2019s menstrual cycle 3.Bipolar disorder(1) -Depressive disorder that consists of episodic mood shifts between mania, major depression, hypomania, and mixed mood states -High substance-abuse  comorbidity -Mania(1) -Mania is characterized by an episode of mood state involving elation with hyperactivity, overinvolvement in activities, increased irritability, flight of ideas, easy distractibility, and minimal sleep -Spring and summer are the peak periods for mania -Manic episodes are shorter than depressive episodes -The patient with bipolar disorder often has difficulty maintaining relationships due to the volatility of his or her mood -Patients with four or more discrete episodes of mood disturbance in 1 year are referred to as \u201crapid cyclers\u201d -Cyclothymic disorders(1) -Chronic mood disturbances with episodes of depression and hypomania -Symptoms last at least 2 years and are milder than those occurring in depressive and manic episodes of bipolar disorder -Symptoms may escalate to the full manic and depressive episodes in bipolar disorder 4.Mood disorders secondary to illness and drugs(1) -Any type of illness, ranging from mild to severe, can cause significant depression -Drug-induced  depression has been documented with use of antihypertensive medications, corticosteroids, and oral contraceptives, as well as alcohol, sedatives, opiates, and psychedelic drugs"
