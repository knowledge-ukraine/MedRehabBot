            "Language disorders in preschool children can be developmental (present from birth) or acquired (resulting from injury or disease following typical language development). A child with a primary language disorder experiences difficulties mainly in the acquisition or use of language. A child with a secondary language disorder experiences language difficulties associated with a separate primary condition (e.g., hearing loss, head injury).(2) Language disorders in early childhood often result from a combination of biological and environmental factors. For example, the effects of prematurity could be compounded if that child is in a neglectful, unresponsive home environment.(3) For typically developing children, \u201cpreschool age\u201d refers to the ages of 2 or 3 years to 5 years.(4) However, some older children with language and/or other delays function at this level and will display the same characteristics as younger, typically developing children. Language skills that correspond to those displayed by typically developing preschool-aged children have also been termed \u201cdeveloping language\u201d skills. Children in the developing language stage have expressive vocabularies that contain more than 50 words and make sentences by combining words; however, their use of grammar is often incorrect due to their developmental stage and the fact that they are still learning basic sentence structure. If a child is chronologically between the ages of 2 or 3 years and 5 years but displays delayed language skills, he or she might still be in the prelinguistic or emerging language period.(4) For detailed information on the assessment and treatment of children in the emerging language period, please see Clinical Review\u2026Language Disorders: Toddlers ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T709106"

Several areas ofIf a child does poorly on a standardized test of vocabulary, analysis of standardized testing should be completed in order to identify classes or groups of words (e.g., spatial words, question words) that the child has difficulty understanding or expressing. Note whether or not the child displays signs of word-finding  difficulties (e.g., circumlocutions, use of overly general terms such as \u201cthing,\u201d or difficulty naming items comprehended on a receptive language test)(4) -Children with specific language impairment use fewer verbs in spontaneous speech and are less likely to use low-frequency  verbs as compared to typically developing peers(20)It is important to assess a child\u2019s receptive and expressive syntax and morphology separately because 1) a child might produce a sentence structure expressively that he or she does not understand when nonverbal cues are removed, and 2) having information on both receptive and expressive skills will inform the course of treatment and goal selection(4)A child\u2019s ability to understand language syntax might be affected by the context within which the language is used. For example, in contextualized settings, nonverbal support (e.g., gesture, eye gaze, objects in the environment) is present in order to aid the child\u2019s comprehension of language which he or she might not understand in isolation. In decontextualized situations, such as while taking a standardized test, nonverbal support  is absent. Gathering information on a child\u2019s ability to comprehend sentence structure in both contextualized and decontextualized situations will provide important information (e.g., is the child able to integrate verbal and nonverbal information?) and help determine the course of treatment (e.g., can the child benefit from a naturalistic therapeutic approach or does treatment need to address the comprehension of nonverbal cues?(4)If a child displays delayed expressive syntax/morphological skills on standardized test measures, criterion-referenced  measures can be used to further examine this area of language development. The collection and analysis of a spontaneous language sample can provide detailed information on a child\u2019s expressive syntax and morphology. Several methods of language sample collection, transcription, and analysis exist.(4) When collecting and analyzing language samples, it is important that the SLP collect and score the data in a manner consistent with the reference database that will be used to analyze it. For example, SLPs must follow the database\u2019s specific guidelines on how to identify utterances and morphemes and which types of utterances to include or exclude. Additionally, SLPs should be aware of the potential effects of setting, participants, activity, and type of material on the language sample collected(21)An MLU yields a measure of morphological complexity in a child\u2019s language. To calculate MLU, a sample of at least 50 utterances is taken. The number of morphemes in this sample is divided by the number of utterances.(22,23) This calculation takes into account the child\u2019s developing morphological skills and syntactic skills. Although MLU can be helpful to obtain a picture of the child\u2019s current level of language development, as well as an outcome measure, it cannot identify language delay or disorder in isolation and must be combined with other measures in a diagnostic speech-language evaluation(23)Assess vocal function, including vocal quality, loudness, pitch, and endurance; if there are specific concerns regarding voice, refer to otolaryngologist for complete workup to rule out laryngeal pathologies prior to completing a full",

Prior to beginning intervention services, the SLP must become aware of the family\u2019s value of talk, the handling of social status in conversations, beliefs about when a child becomes able to communicate intentionally, and beliefs about how children learn language.(15) In addition to cultural variables, individual family variables may impact the level of involvement a family wishes to have in treatment provision (e.g., providing therapy following parent/family training, attending clinician-led  therapy sessions, completing homework sent by the child\u2019s SLP)(4)",

            "When working with preschool-aged  children, SLPs can use clinician-directed  methods, child-centered  approaches, and/or hybrid approaches(4) \u2013Clinician-directed  (CD) methods: CD methods include drill, drill play (e.g., target language form is practiced after every \u201cturn\u201d in a game), and the use of commercial software programs. CD methods, especially those involving computer  games, may be motivating to children and facilitate intense practice of language goals; however, it is important to employ strategies to generalize new language knowledge to the child\u2019s daily life and to ensure that the child can use the new knowledge in socially appropriate ways(4) \u2013Child-centered  (CC) approaches: CC approaches are generally recommended when the goal is to improve the child\u2019s ability to communicate in general (rather than to address specific syntactical, morphological, or semantic goals). One example of a CC approach is indirect language stimulation (ILS).(4) In ILS: -Clinician and/or parent/guardian uses expansions, extensions, recasts, and open-ended  and verbal reflective questions when interacting with the child(4) -Expansions are adult responses to child utterances in which the adult repeats the child\u2019s utterance in a way that corrects syntax, vocabulary, or articulation/phonology, but keeps the basic structure of the child\u2019s utterance. For example, if a child says, \u201cHim want milt\u201d the adult corrects the statement by saying, \u201cLook! He wants milk!\u201d(51) -Extensions are adult responses to child utterances in which the adult responds to the child\u2019s utterance with correct syntax, vocabulary, and articulation/phonology and extends the idea or topic of the child\u2019s original utterance. For example, if a child says, \u201cHim want milt\u201d the adult responds by saying, \u201cHe wants milk. He must be thirsty!\u201d(51) -Recasts are adult responses to child utterances in which the adult maintains the topic of the child\u2019s utterance in a way that corrects syntax, vocabulary, or articulation/phonology, but changes the format of the original utterance in some way. Recasts can be basic or complex and sometimes additional information can be included in the adult\u2019s recast. For example, if a child says, \u201cHim want milt\u201d the adult can recast the statement by saying, \u201cOh, look! Do you think he wants milk?\u201d(51) -Authors of a systematic review (included 35 studies) and meta-analysis  (included 14 studies) on the effectiveness of recasts in language therapy with children found that the current evidence supports the use of recasts in language therapy for children with specific language impairment. Researchers did not find a strong evidence to support the use of recasts in language therapy for children with intellectual disability (ID); however, outcomes were generally positive. Because of the variety of methodology and outcomes measured, firm conclusions were difficult to make. Additionally, authors cautioned clinicians not to assume all parents who are taught about how to use recasts will be using them effectively or consistently. Parents of children with language impairment should be provided with frequent education about recasting in conversations with their child(51) -One-word  labels are provided for whatever the child is focusing on or referring to through the use of preverbal communication (e.g., providing a word label for an object to which the child is pointing)(4) \u2013Hybrid approaches: Hybrid approaches are less structured than CD approaches, but provide more structure and clinician-direction  than do CC approaches.(4) Hybrid approaches include: -Milieu teaching: Intervention, which takes place incidentally in a conversational format within a natural setting, strives to teach new language forms in a functional context. However, the context is somewhat controlled so that the child 1) is required to initiate communication, 2) has a need to engage in social communication, and 3) receives natural rewards for his or her communication attempts.(4,34)MT is often described in the literature as an intervention for children with language disorders; however, the exact intervention protocols, including frequency and length of sessions, are not well-defined.(59) The effectiveness of MT for improving communication abilities in preschool children with language disorders is unknown. In a 2012 What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) Intervention Report published by the United States Department of Education, there were many studies that were found on MT in the literature; however, only one study from 1991 met the WWC standards to be included as part of the Intervention Report. According to this study, there was no apparent effect of MT on communication abilities.(59) Additional, well-designed studies are necessary to determine the effectiveness of MT on the communication abilities of preschool children with language disorders -Enhanced milieu teaching (EMT): EMT combines the features of milieu teaching (discussed above) with features of a responsive conversational style (in which models of appropriate language are provided). In a study conducted in the United States, the effects of EMT on six children with language disorders between the ages of 37 and 80 months were examined. Results indicated that EMT was effective in increasing the children\u2019s use of targeted language structures during treatment sessions at home and in the classroom(34) -Focused stimulation: In focused stimulation, treatment is provided in the format of natural conversation. The SLP provides multiple models of the language target (e.g., use of auxiliary verbs) but does not require the child to produce the target. Although the child is not required to produce targeted structures, the environment is manipulated to encourage productions by the child. In addition to modeling the language target and manipulating the environment, \u201csyntax  stories\u201d can be incorporated into focused stimulation therapy. These are stories written collaboratively by the child and SLP and contain numerous examples of the target structure. Once written, the stories can be sent home as part of a home program. Parents are asked to read the stories to their child; however, the child is not asked to produce target structures(35) -Authors of a case study described the use of focused stimulation using both simplified syntactical input, as well as expanded input, with a 25-month-old  male child with a significant expressive language delay (receptive language skills were within normal limits)(36) -The child was enrolled in a 16-session  focused stimulation program during which developmentally appropriate words were targeted(36) -The first half of the sessions were completed with simplified input condition in which the clinician only used two to three word utterances with no grammatical relationship to target words (e.g., \u201cYes, look ball!\u201d) and the second half of the sessions were completed with expanded input with a minimum of four words per utterance with grammatical information presented along with the target word (e.g., \u201cThe ball is bouncing.\u201d)(36) -Ten words were targeted in each treatment condition; the child mastered 6/10 words in the simplified input condition and only 3/10 with the expanded input condition. For this specific child, focused stimulation to increase vocabulary was more effective when the clinician used simple syntactical input, focusing on the target word(36) -Script therapy: In script therapy, an emphasis is placed on using language in a familiar social context.(4) Since the child is familiar with the social context and knows the expectations of the routine event, both the child and the SLP/parent are able to focus their attention on the targeted language forms and/or content. During the course of script therapy, the expected progression of a routine may be intentionally interrupted by the adult in order to elicit additional language from the child.(4,33) In a study conducted in South Korea examining the effectiveness of script-based therapy, four preschool children with language disorders displayed improved use of semantic relation skills, the ability to generalize the use of these skills to other situations, and maintenance of these skills 3 weeks after script-based  therapy was discontinued(33)",
            "During the preschool period, intervention can be carried out by a variety or combination of people: SLPs, paraprofessional (following the guidelines of the American Speech-Language-Hearing  Association), parents, carefully selected peers or siblings who are supported and trained by an SLP, and/or the child\u2019s classroom teacher with support/training provided by an SLP(4,37)",
            "Several models of service delivery exist and can be used when working with a preschool child with a language delay/ disorder: clinical model (child is seen either individually or in a small group in a specialized setting), language-based classrooms, collaborative model (the SLP provides intervention within the child\u2019s mainstream classroom), and consultant model (the SLP trains the child\u2019s teacher and/or parents in ways to modify classroom or daily activities to address the child\u2019s language needs).(4) One collaborative model currently receiving attention by SLPs and early-childhood  educators is Response to Intervention (RTI)(38) \u2013RTI -Principles of RTI(38) -Tiered instruction that is dependent on the individual needs of the child being served. Tiers vary according to level, frequency, and intensity of instruction -High-quality  instruction (involving knowledgeable professionals, varied instructional methods, ongoing assessment, matching experiences to child\u2019s needs, and professional collaboration) -Research-based  core curriculum -Data collection to monitor student progress and instructional effectiveness coupled with attempts to understand a child\u2019s current performance -Evidence-based  interventions -Instructional practices are selected and revised based upon set procedures (e.g., collaborating with the child\u2019s family, consideration of the child\u2019s needs and learning context) -Adherence to RTI principles is monitored -In order to work in early-childhood  settings that incorporate RTI, an SLP may need to:(39) -Gain additional training on the principles and implementation of RTI -Identify and provide preventive services to children at risk for language and learning difficulties -Spend more work time in a consultative role and in the mainstream classroom  -For detailed information on RTI, see Clinical Review\u2026Response to Intervention (RTI) ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T709175",
            "Shared-reading  intervention \u2013Several studies have been conducted which point to the benefits of shared-reading  intervention for preschool-aged children with language delays/disorders.(40,41) Shared-reading  activities are book-centered  activities in which the child and adult work together to construct meaning from the book to which they are attending.(42) Shared-reading  is believed to be beneficial because: -Shared-reading  and exposure to literature enhances a child\u2019s vocabulary development(43) -Shared-reading  activities offer contextual support (i.e., a book or familiar story) which allows the adult to use more complex language and supports the development of the child\u2019s abstract language skills(40,43) -Oral language development and early literacy skills are interrelated and reciprocal(40) -Reading books is a natural activity for many mainstream American families and therefore allows intervention activities to be conducted in a naturalistic environment(42) -Providing intervention services during shared-book reading may strengthen the foundation upon which later literacy skills are built(42) -Once a book has been read, story retelling offers the opportunity to develop a child\u2019s narrative language skills(43) \u2013Despite the benefits of incorporating shared-reading  into a treatment program for language delays and disorders, prior to including these activities in a treatment plan, SLPs should consider an individual child\u2019s/family\u2019s perception of shared-reading  activities, the child\u2019s motivation and desire to participate in book-related  activities, the effect (possibly negative) of changing a parent-child\u2019s  interaction style, and ways to address goals in contexts other than shared-book reading to encourage the generalization of targeted skills(42)",
            "Parent-based  video home training program \u2013In a randomized controlled trial conducted in the Netherlands, researchers examined the results of a parent-based  video home training (PVHT) program for children who had been diagnosed with developmental language delay(44) -Twenty-two  subject groups; each subject group was made up of two parents and one child with developmental language delay; in each of the subject groups the mother was the main caretaker for the child and the families were all of middle-class social economic status (determined by a standardized interview prior to the study)(44) -The subject groups were randomly assigned to either the PVHT group or the control group; the members of the control group received direct child language intervention program (individual 45-minute  weekly speech and language therapy sessions for 12 weeks; parents did not participate in sessions and waited outside the room during sessions)(44) -The mothers in the PVHT group participated in a parent-oriented  video home training program for 13 weeks with 6 bi-weekly  home visits of 90 minutes each(44) -The goal of the PVHT program was to train parents how to use four strategies in their home to promote conversational coherence for their child with language delay(44) -Four strategies included: attachment (relation and affection between child and parent), referencing (using child-directed  behavior and child-adjusted  language to refer to observable ongoing activities and feelings), relevance (situational and linguistic context), and connectivity (connecting conversational acts to earlier utterances and conversations)(44) -Baseline and follow-up  measures were taken with all children before and after the completion of their assigned intervention. Outcomes included: -MLU(44) -PVHT: 2.1 (baseline) to 2.9 (follow-up) -Control: 2.3 (baseline) to 2.9 (follow-up) -Significant differences between the PVHT and control group with both grammaticality and conversational coherence at follow-up  with the PVHT group showing greater improvements(44) -In addition to having the same or better effects on the child\u2019s language, the PVHT seemed to have continued long-lasting effects as demonstrated by continued improvement in all outcome measure scores between a post-treatment  assessment and follow-up three months later(44)  -Researchers concluded that parent training/education should always be incorporated into intervention programs for children with developmental language delay(44)",
