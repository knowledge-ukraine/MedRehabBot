            "Williams syndrome (WS) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder that affects males and females equally and is caused by deletion of part of chromosome 7, which acts like a mutation.(1)WS is caused by a loss of DNA from band 7q11.23 of chromosome 7. It is characterized by distinctive facial features, developmental delay/intellectual disability (ID) of variable degree, prenatal-onset  growth deficiency followed by postnatal growth deficiency, joint problems, and renal and cardiovascular complications and diseases(1,2)"

This pattern is not typical for language acquisition and suggests deficits in joint attention(6,9) -In another atypical pattern of language development, toddlers with WS frequently exhibit fast-mapping  (i.e., the ability to acquire a partial understanding of an early word\u2019s meaning following only brief exposure) of new objects and words  prior to demonstrating exhaustive sorting (i.e., understanding a word\u2019s meaning as well as the appropriate semantic category to which it belongs)(13) \u2013Adults with WS have vocabularies that are often better than expected given their mental age(5,14,15) -Concrete vocabulary and phonological processing skills are relative strengths within the language domain for patients with WS(6) \u2013Individuals with WS often have impairments of word finding -In a study of adolescents with WS conducted in Italy, researchers noted expressive semantic paraphasias (e.g., \u201ccat\u201d for dog)(16) -Word-finding  impairments documented in individuals with WS include delays in language processing, longer response times in naming tasks, use of fillers and iconic gestures, and semantic substitutions(17) \u2013Appropriate syntax is often impaired in both children and adults with WS(10,15) -Significant difficulty comprehending/understanding passive sentences(15) -Impaired production of irregular morphology has been documented in patients with WS throughout adolescence and adulthood(11) \u2013Individuals with WS are usually very friendly and gregarious; however, they can be socially awkward due to pragmatic deficits such as inappropriate requests for attention, repetitive questioning, excessive and indiscriminate flattery, difficulty taking turns in conversation, providing too little or too much information, making irrelevant comments, and reduced comprehension of nonliteral language(6,13,18,19) -In a study conducted in the United Kingdom with 19 children with WS and 20 age-matched  typically developing children, researchers asked the subjects to produce a verbal narrative for an emotionally neutral wordless picture book. Researchers found that, although both groups produced a similar number of \u201cemotion\u201d words (e.g., happy, angry), the children with WS produced a significantly higher number of negative emotion words than the control group.(42) Researchers suggested that because the use of positive emotion words is associated with increased peer popularity, higher frequency use of negative emotion words might contribute to difficulty establishing and maintaining friendships in children with WS(42) -Authors of a functional MRI (fMRI) case study reported that, compared to an age- and sex-matched  control subject, the amygdala (responsible for processing emotions) showed no activation in a 17-year-old  child with WS during a facial expression processing task.(41) Impaired processing of emotions and facial expressions in conversation partners might contribute to pragmatic deficits in patients with WS \u2013Children and adolescents with WS use excessive affective prosody (i.e., nonverbal aspects of language that connote emotion such as rising pitch contour) that does not always appropriately correspond to language content or audience(13) Causes, Pathogenesis, & Risk Factors"

The six core tests are physical setting, audience, topic, purpose (speech acts), visual gestural cues, and abstraction  -In a study conducted in the United States with 20 children and adolescents with WS, researchers compared the TOPL-2  to the Children\u2019s Communication Checklist\u2013Second  Edition (CCC-2)  subscales for assessing pragmatic language abilities. Researchers found that the TOPL-2  identified significantly more children as having pragmatic language impairment than did the CCC-2,  which appeared to be an over-identification.  The TOPL-2  identified all subjects in the study who were under age 8 years as having pragmatic language impairment; hence, researchers suggested that this test was more appropriate for assessing pragmatic language abilities in older children (8+)(37) -Assess receptive and expressive syntax -Receptively, individuals with WS have more difficulty comprehending passive and past tense forms of verbs(15,25,26) -Expressively, individuals with WS exhibit various grammatical errors, such as in gender agreement (\u201cshe dressed himself\u201d), verb conjugation, and substitutions of prepositions.(16) Individuals with WS may never develop the ability to express certain complex grammatical structures/constructions (sometimes called specific grammatical development impairment)(27)Collect a language sample of at least 50 utterances in order to analyze grammatical form productionChildren with WS often have a mean delayed growth of 2 years in MLU.(3) MLU can be measured by collecting a language sample of at least 50 utterances, counting the morphemes in each individual utterance, and finding the average/mean length of utterances based on the 50 utterances collectedMeasures understanding of grammatical contrasts in individuals aged 4 years through adulthoodAssesses comprehension of active and passive sentences in children(15) -Assess receptive and expressive vocabulary(14) -Patients with WS typically have limited expressive and receptive vocabulary,as well as grammatical ability,compared to typically developing age-matched  peers.(14)Expressive vocabulary does appear to be a relative strength for individuals with WS, who have stronger expressive vocabularies compared to children with idiopathic ID(45) -Assess vocabulary with tests of categorization, similarities and differences, and semantic development/awareness(28) -Conventional methods of assessing semantics can overestimate lexico-semantic  knowledge in children with WS; using sophisticated definition tasks instead of categorization tasks in older children is a better method of assessing semantic skills in these children(29) -Conceptual and relational vocabulary is an area of significant weakness for individuals with WS(6)A receptive vocabulary assessment normed for individuals aged 2\u201318  years in which a patient is asked to identify the illustration that best represents the stimulus word said by the examiner(14)An assessment for individuals aged 2 years, 6 months through adulthood that tests receptive vocabulary knowledge(14)An expressive,concrete vocabulary assessment normed for individuals aged 2\u201318  years; the patient is asked to name the object, action, or concept pictured(14)Normed for children aged 1.5\u20137  (level 1) and 8\u201317  years (level 2); includes subtests for expressive vocabulary, word definitions, receptive vocabulary, word opposites, multiple contexts, synonyms and figurative usage, and conjunctions and transition words(14) -Abstract language/nonliteral language comprehension -Individuals with WS typically are friendly and socially engaging; however, comprehension of abstract or non-literal language, such as sarcasm, metaphor, and simile, typically is impaired(36) -In a study conducted in Australia with 26 individuals with WS as well as 26 typically developing, mentally age-matched  controls and 26 typically developing, chronologically age-matched  controls, researchers found that individuals with WS performed significantly below the level of the chronologically age-matched  controls on all measures of comprehension of non-literal  language, but not significantly differently from that of the mentally age-matched  controls(36)  -Narrative assessment is used to determine the patient\u2019s ability to use expressive language in a context that is more complex than conversation.(30) Narrative skills require the patient to incorporate an introduction, sequenced events, and a conclusion into his or her language sample -In a research study conducted in Portugal with 12 individuals with WS (ages 9 to 32 years), researchers found that individuals with WS produced narratives that were significantly less coherent, diverse, and complex when compared to typically developing age-matched  controls (n = 10)(30)Assess vocal function, including vocal quality, loudness, pitch, and endurance; if there are specific concerns regarding voice, refer to otolaryngologist for complete workup to rule out laryngeal pathologies prior to completing a full",
