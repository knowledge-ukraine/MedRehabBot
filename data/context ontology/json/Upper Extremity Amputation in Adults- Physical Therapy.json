            "The removal of all or part of the upper extremity",
            "Amputations of the upper limb are much less frequent than amputations of the lower limb and are usually due to trauma(3,5)",
            "Based on their level, they can be categorized into the following types:(3) \u2013Shoulder disarticulation and interscapulothoracic or forequarter amputation -Both are rare amputations, usually a result of cancer or severe trauma -In an interscapulothoracic or forequarter amputation, the upper extremity (UE), scapula, and clavicle are removed -In a shoulder disarticulation, the amputation is through the shoulder joint -A disarticulation is an amputation through a joint,(1,2) without cutting the bone -In a true shoulder disarticulation, the humeral head is removed -A modified shoulder amputation may be performed through the surgical neck of the humerus to preserve the humeral head -If the humeral head can be saved, the shape of the shoulder can be maintained, allowing for a more natural-looking  shoulder contour \u2013Transhumeral amputation -Removal of any portion of the humerus -With this amputation, preservation of bone length is important for function and prosthesis use -A long humeral stump preserves some functional shoulder internal and external rotation, which is lost with a short stump(4) -A postoperative prosthesis may be utilized directly after surgery \u2013Elbow disarticulation -Removal of the forearm at the elbow -Allows rotation of the humerus while utilizing a prosthesis \u2013Transradial amputation -Amputation through the radius and ulna bones while maintaining the elbow joint -A long transradial amputation preserves some supination and pronation; all is lost with a short amputation(4) -Forearm rotation and strength can be preserved  -Krukenberg procedure(17) -The stump of the transradial amputation (which includes the radius and ulna) is surgically converted into a claw-like pincer with preserved dexterity and tactile sensation -Surgery is performed as a secondary operation after a transradial amputation -These digits may allow for functional use of the UE during grasp and release tasks with self-care,  leisure, and work tasks -A conventional prosthesis can be worn over the Krukenberg forearm and myoelectric devices can be adapted to use the forearm motion -Best suited for patients who are blind, because they do not have the visual input necessary to operate prosthetic devices effectively \u2013Wrist disarticulation -Candidates are reportedly good prosthetic users as this amputation maintains function of the distal radioulnar joint for forearm rotation -Wrist disarticulation is controversial. Opponents argue that fitting with a prosthesis is more complicated than a transradial amputation, whereas proponents cite preserved forearm rotation (wrist disarticulation results in preservation of about 50% of pronation and supination)(4) \u2013Carpus amputation \u2013Partial hand amputation -Thumb amputation -As the thumb is highly significant for overall hand function, loss of hand function may occur -If the amputation is at or beyond the most distal thumb joint, hand function may be preserved -Amputation at the metacarpophalangeal joint can be disastrous to hand function; other surgical procedures may be required to enhance hand performance -Hypersensitivity and inability to tolerate cold may occur at the residual digit -Digit amputation -Amputations distal to the insertion of the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) allow for continued movement in flexion -Amputations proximal to the FDS tendon insertion maintain use of the residual stump in grasping tasks (e.g., metacarpophalangeal [MCP]flexion via lumbricals) -Middle finger amputations often make maintaining a grasp of small items a challenge, as the items may drop through the space created in the hand by the amputation -Fingertip amputation -Reportedly the most common type of UE amputation -Complications may occur such as phantom limb pain, hypersensitivity, and an inability to tolerate cold"
