            "Degenerative anomia is a primary symptom of semantic dementia (SD), a type of frontotemporal dementia in which patients have poor semantic memory but relatively intact episodic memory.(2) Degenerative anomia is also a symptom of primary progressive aphasia (PPA). PPA is a degenerative form of aphasia associated with atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain.(29) There are three clinical subtypes of PPA: nonfluent/agrammatic variant PPA, semantic variant PPA, and logopenic variant PPA.(29) The primary symptom of logopenic PPA is deficits in word retrieval (i.e., anomia).(29) For detailed information on frontotemporal dementia, see Clinical Review\u2026Dementia, Frontotemporal ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T708948. Patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) might exhibit degenerative anomia in conjunction with more global memory deficits (for detailed information about AD, see Clinical Review\u2026Alzheimer\u2019 s Disease: Speech Therapy ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T708913).(2) Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) sometimes exhibit anomia associated with disease progression (for detailed information about MS, see Clinical Review\u2026Multiple Sclerosis:Communication Deficits ; CINAHL Topic ID: T708856)(36)"

Subjects were trained on three lists of 15 words until they reached criterion level. Orthographic cues and full word cues were provided during the intervention phase. Subjects were tested immediately post treatment and 1 month afterwards. Results indicated that subjects achieved and maintained significant improvement on two of the three word lists(19) \u2013Authors of a case study from Canada combined an errorless learning approach with the MossTalk Words software for treatment of degenerative anomia associated with SD(20) -Multiple-baseline  design; treatment sessions were 3 times per week for 1 hour each; principles of errorless learning were combined with MossTalk Words software to train the patient on 3 lists of 20 words each -Within 4 months, the patient relearned 41 of 60 trained words; knowledge of these words was maintained after 3 months. The patient\u2019s word knowledge improved on untrained items as well; however, the percentage was not statistically significant \u2013Orthographic treatment: Authors of a case study with a 69-year-old  bilingual Norwegian-English  speaking woman with PPA reported naming improvements in untreated items in both languages after being treated with an orthographic treatment. The computer program used in this case study involved having the patient see a picture alone, a word alone, and then paired word-picture  stimuli. The patient was cued by the computer to copy the words she had seen on a sheet of paper and then was given examples of correct and incorrect word pairings and asked to state \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d if the pairings were accurate(35)",
            "Self-study  of picture dictionaries and other resources (word-picture  matching):  Authors of a case study from the United Kingdom examining the effects of self-study  and verbal rehearsal of word-picture  matches in sets of semantic categories (30 min/day) indicated short-term  gains on fluency naming of practiced categories but a decline after termination of daily intensive training.(15) Researchers discussed the inherently \u201cerrorless learning\u201d aspect of this treatment and its benefits",
            "Meaningful contextual link/autobiographical association:  Personal references and descriptions (e.g., \u201cdog\u201d: \u201cYour dog is named Maddie. She is a Labrador.\u201d) are explicitly taught for each target word during treatment with the rationale that these meaningful links will strengthen retention ability. Authors of a case study from the United Kingdom indicated that the words that were taught with meaningful and personal information were better retained than words that were taught using impersonal definitions. Retention of target words 250 days after treatment was 50%.(7) In another study conducted in the United Kingdom, researchers examined the relationship between personal familiarity with words and retention ability and found that autobiographical experience did not lead to greater retention of words.(21) The authors suggested that retention may be dependent on both \u201cconcept frequency\u201d (number of times an object or concept is encountered) and \u201cconcept quality\u201d (the richness of the underlying semantic representation and amount of knowledge of an item)(6)",
            "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) : tDCS involves painless, noninvasive stimulation of the brain with direct electrical current. Current is applied through electrodes on the head. Although showing promise in research studies, brain stimulation is not widely available for clinical use as a treatment for aphasia(24) \u2013In a study conducted in the United States with 6 patients with PPA, researchers combined either tDCS or a sham treatment plus spelling intervention in a within-subject crossover study. Results showed improvement in spelling on the trained items for both tDCS and sham treatments; however, significant improvement on spelling of untrained items was observed only in the tDCS condition(24)  . Problem Goal Intervention Expected Progression Home Program Word retrieval Increase recall of forgotten wordsErrorless learning and effortful learning approach _ Treatment is considered \u201cerrorless\u201d if it avoids the production of incorrect responses and learning of incorrect associations. It can be \u201ceffortful\u201d in its use of higher-level cognitive function in describing and priming target words. The patient should be encouraged to avoid naming the object or action during stimulus presentation. Instead, engage the patient in a facilitated conversation about the target\u2019s conceptual, semantic, and/or phonological features with the purpose of priming them to remember the word(16) _ _ See Treatment summary , aboveOnce a patient has relearned one set or list of words, the SLP can progress to another set of wordsNo home-based program using errorless and effortful learning has been trialed Word retrieval Increase recall of forgotten wordsComputer-based intervention _ A computer program can be used to provide cueing, feedback, and visual support for patients relearning words. There are several types of commercially available computer programs to assist patients in learning words(19) _ _ See Treatment summary , aboveComputer programs progress according to criteria set by the clinician; new words will be trained once the patient has reached pre-determined level of accuracy on previously targeted words (e.g., 70%, 80%, 90%)A computer program can be used at home by the patient  Word retrieval Increase recall of forgotten wordsSelf-study of picture dictionaries and other resources (word- picture matching) _ Patients are asked to spend a designated part of the day (30 minutes) actively manipulating, naming, matching, and describing a small set of words and/or pictures of known persons and objects. Families and patients create their own set of words.(4,15) It is hypothesized that this approach would be most effective at the early stages of SD, when patients have more intact conceptual knowledge _ _ See Treatment summary , aboveProgression through the words and pictures is self-directed and paced according to the patient\u2019s preferenceThis treatment is a self- directed, home-based program Word retrieval Increase recall of forgotten wordsMeaningful contextual link/autobiographical association _ Assist the patient in creating personal descriptions for words (e.g., \u201cdog\u201d: \u201cYour dog is named Maddie.
