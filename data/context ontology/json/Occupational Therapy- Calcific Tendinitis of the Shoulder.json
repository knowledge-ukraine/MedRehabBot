            "Calcific tendinitis (CT) of the shoulder is a condition associated with calcium phosphate crystals in one or more of the rotator cuff tendons.(1) The calcifications likely disturb normal shoulder joint mobility. Pain can decrease shoulder function and result in difficulty performing ADLs",
            "Patients may present in acute, subacute, or chronic stages of CT. Most acute cases resolve spontaneously",
            "CT may be idiopathic (type I) or secondary (type II). In type II CT, there is coexisting endocrine disease, and it is less likely to respond to nonoperative treatment(1)",
            "Uhthoff\u2019s classification includes a pre-calcific  stage in which tenocytes undergo metaplasia to chondrocytes, followed by a calcific stage and post-calcific  stage. The calcific stage is further delineated into formative, resting, and resorptive stages.(18) Pain is most notable during the resorptive stage(19)",
            "The initial management approach usually is conservative and involves therapeutic modalities for pain management and exercises for restoring deficits in shoulder flexibility and strength,(#,3)as well as shoulder mechanics and scapular stability",
            "Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT), ultrasound,corticosteroid injection, and ultrasound-guided  needling are other management options. Arthroscopic debridement or decompression surgery may be necessary when the calcifications are large or pain persists after conservative treatment(1,19)"

            "Authors of a systematic review designed to compare the effectiveness of several nonoperative treatments for CT found that UGN, RSW, and H-FSW  were more effective in alleviating pain and restoring function than low-energy  focused extracorporeal shockwave therapy, TENS, and ultrasound for treatment of chronic CT of the shoulder(19) . Problem Goal Intervention Expected Progression Home Program  Shoulder pain Resolution of pain Therapeutic modalities _ Ultrasound may be utilized; please see Treatment summary , above _ _ Gentle posture exercises to improve alignment of scapula and shoulder mechanics _ _ Radial ESWT (4 sessions applied at 1- week intervals) was found safe and effective for decreasing pain and improving shoulder function at 4 weeks and 6 months follow-up(12) _ _ Iontophoresis with acetic acid combined with conservative treatment did not improve outcomes at 6 weeks compared to conservative treatment alone(13) _ _ Low-quality evidence shows that pulsed electromagnetic field therapy and low- levellaser therapy may not provide benefit in the treatment of CT(22) _ _ Apply cryotherapeutic agents (e.g., ice packs, ice massage) frequently for pain management in acute casesN/A Provide a home program that incorporates pain- relieving strategies  Restricted ROM Normalization of ROM Physical agents and mechanical modalities _ Moist heat pack may relax muscle tightness prior to passive ROM. Begin with Codman\u2019s pendulum exercises _ _ Manual therapy _ Glenohumeral and scapulothoracic mobilizations to normalize ROM and joint mobility _ _ No evidence is available to support soft-tissue work or cross-fiber friction massage(14) _ _ Prescription, application of devices and equipment _ Discourage the use of arm slingProgress each unique patient as appropriate and indicatedImplement a home program that incorporates ROM activities as indicated Decreased independence in self- care ADLsMaximize functional independenceAdaptive equipment/ adaptive techniques Provide training in use of adaptive equipment/ techniques to increase independence in self- care (e.g., use of long- handled sponge for bathing; adapted techniques for donning bra) and IADLs (e.g., reorganizing kitchen supplies so that accessing needed supplies and equipment does not require overhead reaching)As symptoms resolve, patient will no longer require equipment or modificationsUse of equipment and modifications at home  Decreased strength Normalization of strengthTherapeutic exercises _ Begin with low- resistance exercises in pain-free active ROM, as tolerated, several times throughout the day. Strengthening exercises for scapular stabilizers _ _Progress to eccentric and resistive strengthening as pain permitsImplement a home program that incorporates strengthening activities as indicated Reduced function/ disability _ _ Postural changesResumption of normal shoulder activities _ _ Improve postureFunctional training _ Physical conditioning for return to occupation or sport, including dynamic scapular stability exercises.
