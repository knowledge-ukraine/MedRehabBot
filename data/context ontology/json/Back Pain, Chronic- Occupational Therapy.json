            "Any pain that lasts for longer than 3 months is considered chronic pain. Chronic back pain can arise from a specific injury or condition (e.g., spinal stenosis) or may not have an identifiable cause. The low back is a common location for chronic back pain and may be related to issues with the lumbar spine (e.g., bony, disc, ligamentous), but can also occur in the upper back (e.g., irritation due to poor posture).(1) For more information on chronic low back pain see Clinical Review\u2026Back Pain, Low: Chronic; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T708723"
