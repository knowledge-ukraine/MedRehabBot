Therefore, practitioners need to develop an individualized training program and submit the patient to periodic sonographic exams \u2013Initial nonoperative management of pain in acute AT usually includes topical, oral, or injected pain medication, icing, shoe inserts, self-stretching,  taping, and LLLT for 3 to 6 months(1,2,17,18,19) \u2013Progress therapeutic exercises gradually over 12 weeks. Consider other treatment options if the patient does not show improvement in that timeframe(1,2) \u2013Authors of systematic reviews found that eccentric loading exercise and shockwave therapy (SWT) were dependably effective physical therapy treatments for improving signs and symptoms associated with AT \u2013Authors of a cohort study (n = 36 patients with chronic AT longer than 6 months) in South Korea found that SWT was effective for managing AT that was unresponsive to conservative treatment(7) \u2013Authors of a systematic review recommended that clinicians consider an eccentric-concentric  loading exercise program in conjunction with or as an alternative to an isolated eccentric loading exercise program(13) \u2013Eccentric training and heavy slow resistance training both result in equally good, lasting outcomes in patients with chronic midportion Achilles tendinopathy(17) -Based on an RCT conducted in Denmark -Fifty-eight  athletes were randomized to receive either eccentric or heavy slow resistance training for a duration of 12 weeks -Exercises -The eccentric group performed three sets of 15 repetitions of eccentric loading of the Achilles while standing on a step. The exercise was performed once with straight knees and once with bent knees, 2 times per day, 7 days per week for 12 weeks. Load was gradually increased by use of a weighted backpack as tolerated by pain -The heavy slow resistance group performed heel raises with bent knees in the seated calf raise machine, heel raises with straight knee in the leg press machine, and heel raises with straight knees standing on a disc with a barbell on shoulders. The patients performed three sets of 15-repetition  maximum (RM) in week 1, three sets of 12 RM in weeks 2 and 3, four sets of 10 RM in weeks 4 and 5, four sets of 8 RM in weeks 6 to 8, and four sets of 6 RM in weeks 9 to 12 -Outcome measures were assessed at 0, 12 weeks, and at the 52-week  follow-up and included tendon pain assessment (V AS), function and symptoms (VISA-A), tendon swelling, tendon neovascularization, and treatment satisfaction -Both groups showed significant improvements in VISA-A,  V AS, reduction of tendon thickness, and neovascularization -Average exercise compliance was 78% in the eccentric training groups versus 92% in the heavy slow resistance group \u2013The Alfredson protocol for eccentric training may be an effective method of exercise intervention  -Consists of three sets of 15 repetitions of heel drops with knee straight and three sets of 15 repetitions with knee slightly flexed -Various factors such as rate, load, and frequency need clarification -Results with this protocol have not been as good with nonathletes as with athletes, suggesting that motivation can be a limiting factor. One possible reason for the disparity in compliance between athletes and nonathletes is that the goal with the Alfredson protocol is to complete 180 repetitions a day, even if pain is experienced. However, in an RCT comparing the outcomes from the Alfredson protocol versus a \u201cdo-as-tolerated\u201d  protocol of the same exercises, no significant difference between the two was found(11) \u2013The addition of an AirHeel brace to eccentric training does not appear to provide a therapeutic advantage over eccentric exercises alone(15) -Based on a systematic review of RCTs \u2013Whole-body  vibration training may be a viable alternative or complementary intervention for patients with AT not responding well to an eccentric exercise program(12) -Based on an RCT -Fifty-eight  patients with AT were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of either whole-body  vibration training, eccentric strengthening, or a wait-and-see approach -Outcome measures involved a Likert scale, V AS, isokinetic measurements, and sonography -Results from the whole-body  vibration training group were comparable to the eccentric training group, but with fewer treatment sessions. Both groups did better than the wait-and-see  approach. Whole-body  vibration training was especially effective in those with insertional AT \u2013A standardized extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) program provides beneficial effects over a 24-month  period for the treatment of insertional Achilles tendinopathy(26) \u2013Authors of a similar study on ESWT concluded that ESWT has the potential to provide long-term  benefits for improving pain at rest and during activity in patients with refractory AT(27) .
