Both groups participated for 20 minutes, 4 times a week for one month -Main difference between RAT and BWSTT is the addition of a mechanical assistant during RAT so that alternating steps with both feet can be achieved by patients -Outcome measures were defecation time and enema use, both of which were significantly reduced in the RAT group -Authors speculated that alternating gait with hip flexion adjusted abdominal pressure and aided intestinal peristalsis \u2013Authors of an RCT study conducted in the United States found that robot-assisted  BWSTT improved peak fitness levels in patients with chronic motor-incomplete  SCI(29)",
