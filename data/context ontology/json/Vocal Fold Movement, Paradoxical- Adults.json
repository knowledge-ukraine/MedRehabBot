A laryngeal examination must be completed by an experienced otolaryngologist torule out the presence of any laryngeal growths, such as nodules, polyps, recurrent laryngeal papillomata, tumors, contact ulcers, and laryngeal webs. In addition, the laryngeal examination serves to determine the position of the larynx (e.g., high, low) and any other characteristics of the vocal folds, including vocal fold closure and physical aspects of the folds (e.g., swollen, tense). The individual should be referred for a follow-up  biopsyA mirror examination involves placing a mirror in the back of the patient\u2019s throat. V ocal folds can be visualized by reflecting light down to the larynx(13)Rigid endoscopy is performed with a rigid tube placed into the oral or pharyngeal cavity. A rigid laryngoscope provides the clearest view of the larynx; however, the tongue needs to be held by the examiner, and normal speech production cannot be performed during the examination. A flexible laryngoscope uses fiberoptic technology and can be passed through the nose to the back of the throat, allowing for examination of the larynx during voicingVideostroboscopic examination allows the examiner to see the vocal folds vibrating in slow motion and provides information on any abnormalities present during voice production (e.g., abnormal closure). It is performed with instrumentation used for oral endoscopy or nasendoscopy and is combined with a strobe light correlated to vocal fold vibration(14)Electroglottography provides information on vocal fold closure by measuring the electrical resistance of two electrodes placed around the neck(11)The SLP should gather information regarding the onset of the PVFM, possible triggers of the PVFM, nature of the breathing difficulty, any previous respiratory disease or difficulties, the patient\u2019s regular vocal activities (e.g., singing, sports), and recent voice changes. The SLP can informally evaluate the patient\u2019s vocal quality, muscle tension, and breathing patterns during an interview.

Observe the patient\u2019s behavior (e.g., evidence of neck strain) during voicing or voicing attempts(12) -Acoustic measures of voice include signal-to-noise ratio, jitter (pitch perturbation), and shimmer (amplitude perturbation). Computerized voice analysis programs such as the Multi-Dimensional V oice Program (MDVP) allow the clinician to calculate these voice parameters and compare the patient's results to normative data provided by the programThe patient is asked take a deep breath and sustain the vowel /a/ for as long as possible on a continuous expiration(15)Number of syllables or words produced on one expiratory flowThe length of time a patient can produce \u201cS\u201d over the length of time the patient can produce \u201cZ.\u201d A number greater than 1.4 indicates difficulty with movement of the vocal folds. The normal value is 1Low to high and high to low. Listen for pitch breaks, reduced range, tension, and cessation of voicingDuring tasks such as counting and reading passages, the examiner can assess -Are the inhalations stridulous (high-pitched and noisy)? -Is air released prior to phonation? -Does the patient exhibit shortness of breath? -Does the patient\u2019s vocal quality change as the breath diminishes at the end of exhalation? -Is the voice weak or breathy? -Is the patient\u2019s voicing effortful or forced?Observe patient for any muscle tension in the neck, jaw, shoulders, face, or lipsObserve patient's breath support during sustained phonation, at rest, and during conversationThe Consensus Auditory-Perceptual  Evaluation of V oice (CAPE-V)  is available on the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association website//www.asha.org/siteassets/uploadedFiles/ASHA/SIG/03/CAPE-V-Procedures-and-Form.pdf ) and can be used to systematically describe the severity of auditory-perceptual  characteristics of the voice.(16) The results can be considered with those of other instrumental measures to formulate hypotheses regarding the anatomic and physiological bases of voice problems.

In addition, the SLP might be involved in diagnostic input, patient education, supportive counseling, and voice therapy.(1) Research on interventions for PVFM is limited(1)",
            "Authors of an evidence-based  systematic review of the literature on speech therapy treatment for PVFM reported finding 65 studies or reports; two of these were RCTs and 50 were case reports. In total, there were 420 individuals included in the studies, ranging in age from 8 years to 87 years.(1) Authors of this review concluded that, although the evidence for speech therapy for the treatment of PVFM was promising, additional, well-controlled  studies are needed. Treatment techniques cited among most of the studies included in this review were: \u2013focusing on performing active exhalations \u2013relaxing the muscles of the mouth and throat \u2013providing patient education about how to voluntarily control the vocal folds \u2013teaching breathing techniques such as diaphragmatic breathing, open throat breathing, and coordinated thoracic-abdominal  breathing \u2013counseling \u2013providing information about vocal hygiene \u2013exercising inspiratory muscles",
            "The primary therapy method for PVFM is laryngeal control therapy, which involves teaching the patient to use diaphragmatic breathing to decrease throat tension and promote passive inspiration.(23) Additionally, the patient is taught to relax the upper body, especially the neck, during speech and at rest and is educated about the use of vocal hygiene measures (e.g., adequate water intake, eliminating throat clearing, and eliminating shouting)(23) \u2013Laryngeal control breathing techniques (LCBTs) focus on having the patient use noisy nasal inhalation with lips tightly closed followed by noisy exhalation through pursed lips. These techniques are combined with diaphragmatic breathing to increase efficiency and control(25) \u2013Initial therapy sessions should focus on performing and perfecting LCBTs in isolation and then move on to functional situations that are known to trigger episodes(25) -In a retrospective chart review study conducted in the United States that included 104 patients (adolescents and adults) with symptoms of PVFM that were exercise-related  only, researchers found that laryngeal control therapy was effective in managing these symptoms.(23) Sixty-seven  of the patients identified as having exercise-induced  PVFM enrolled in laryngeal control therapy; of these, 48 (72%) exhibited improvement in or complete resolution of symptoms related to exercise-induced PVFM(23)",
            "Biofeedback training: \u2013Authors of a case study of a 42-year-old  female with PVFM found that use of aerodynamic feedback resulted in immediate improvement in vocal quality. In this case, the biofeedback was a real-time  computer screen display of the patient\u2019s generated pressure and airflow(26)  \u2013In a study conducted in Canada with 25 patients with PVFM, researchers found that use of biofeedback in laryngeal control therapy statistically and clinically reduced both symptoms of PVFM and use of asthma medications.As the patient visualized their larynx, they were trained in normal laryngeal anatomy and breathing physiology as well as laryngeal control exercises(21)",
            "Respiratory retraining:  Respiratory retraining includes breathing exercises that focus on the rhythm and location of breathing: quiet rhythmic breathing, breathing with vocal resistance, pulsed exhalation, and abdominal focus. Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) involves inspiratory resistance maneuvers to improve inspiratory muscle strength(22) \u2013Sixteen patients with PVFM and chronic cough underwent therapy that combined respiratory retraining and pharmacological therapy (protein pump inhibitor to reduce edema) for 4 to 23 weeks, with a mean of 5.7 treatment visits.(22) The authors proposed that aberrant laryngeal sensation leads to chronic cough in patients with PVFM. Patients were required to perform breathing exercises twice daily for 10 to 15 minutes. At follow-up,  only 1 patient had a persistent cough, suggesting that improvement in laryngeal sensory function is a critical element in reducing chronic cough in patients with PVFM",
