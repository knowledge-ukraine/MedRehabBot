The authors of a study conducted in the United States found that the majority of hand surgeons (65.3%) responding to a survey about zone 2 repairs perform a 4strand  repair using 30 or 4-0 braided, nonabsorbable suture material along with an epitendinous repair. Four hundred ten surgeons responded to the survey. Of those who responded, surgeons with \u2265 15 years in practice were more likely to use a 2strand  repair and passive (vs. early active) rehabilitation protocol(23) Authors of a basic science study propose new repair techniques (asymmetric and circumferential) that utilize FDS autograft to buttress repairs instead of a core suture. Based on a cadaveric sheep study, the authors demonstrated tensile strength similar to 6strand  repairs and greater than 2- and 4-strand  repairs. In addition, the asymmetric repair required greater force than the 6strand  repair to create a 2 mm gap(30) Reconstruction/tendon graft  this method is utilized when pronounced tension on the tendon would prohibit a direct repair Investigation continues into the factors involved in tendon healing and adhesion formation. A better understanding of the role of gene expression in tendon development may help to identify factors that can be utilized (e.g., growth factors, cytokines, chemokines) to facilitate healing and prevent adhesions(15) Use of \u201cwide-awake\u201d  surgery, in which the repair is done with local anesthesia and without tourniquet, is an emerging technique that allows assessment of ROM and quality of repair (and corrections to be made as needed) before incision closure(23,24,29) The shift toward early active motion after flexor tendon repair in order to prevent complications has evolved because of surgical techniques that provide a stronger repair(3,14,18)",

The approach used will vary depending on zone of injury.(2) Patient characteristics and nature of repair will also influence rehabilitation decisions(30) \u2013Active mobilization protocols are associated with larger tendon excursions than passive mobilization protocols, thus reducing adhesion formation; however, excessive stress can increase risk of rupture(7) \u2013Immobilization technique is another protocol, and is most often used with noncompliant patients or young children(32) -The affected hand is immobilized in a cast for 3\u20134weeks following surgery and then substituted with a dorsal blocking splint for 2 more weeks -The dorsal blocking splint is discharged at 4\u20136weeks -At 3\u20134 weeks postoperatively, the patient starts passive digital flexion and extension exercises and active tendon gliding exercises -At 4\u20136 weeks postoperatively, the patient starts gentle blocking exercises -At 6\u20138 weeks, the patient starts gentle resistive exercises -This technique is associated with tendon ruptures but is favored with children, noncompliant or impulsive patients, and patients with extensive hand injuries or impaired cognition(1) -Immobilization now tends to be used only with patients who are too young or lack cognitive ability to understand precautions of an early mobilization protocol or if associated injuries such as fractures contraindicate mobilization(2) \u2013Early passive motion (early controlled motion protocols)(2,6) -Since early controlled motion following tendon repair was first proposed, research has provided significant clinical evidence to support its use(8,9,10,11,12) -Most early passive mobilization protocols follow an early (0\u20133 weeks), intermediate (3\u20136 weeks), and late (6\u20138 weeks and beyond) stage timeline(2) -The early stage coincides with the inflammatory stage of healing. A dorsal block hand and wrist orthosis (wrist position between 20\u00b0 flexion to 20\u00b0 extension and MCP 40-50\u00b0  flexion) typically is used to limit movement -In the earlystage, passive flexion is provided manually or via rubber band traction (see Kleinert technique, below) -In the intermediate stage, active flexion exercises may be initiated while continuing the use of the dorsal block splint -Most protocols discontinue the splint at 6 weeks and allow initiation of gentle resistive exercise (6 to 8 weeks);however, this typically is determined by the surgeon  -Louisville (or Kleinert) technique allows for protected tendon gliding to reduce scar adherence but may cause PIP joint contractures -The patient wears a splint that holds the wrist and MCP joints in flexion (40\u00b0 and 45\u00b0, respectively) for 24 hours a day for 3 weeks -Rubber bands are attached on one end to the fingernails (using glue) and on the other end to the splint so that the PIP joints are in 40\u201360\u00b0  of flexion -The patient actively extends the interphalangeal joints several times a day and allows the bands to pull the fingers back into the flexed position -If the patient has PIP joint contractures, dynamic extension splinting can begin at 5\u20136 weeks postoperatively -At 6 weeks postoperatively, the patient starts blocking exercises -At 6\u20138 weeks postoperatively, the patient starts gentle resistive exercises -Modified Kleinert splinting may be used to perform hourly exercises by the patient. The rubber band/pulley portion of the splint is used to passively flex the digits, and the patient is able to actively extend the digits. When the patient ceases extending, the tension of the rubber band on the splint passively returns the finger to a flexed position. The patient may perform 10 repetitions per hour. The patient should be cautioned not to actively flex the digits(2,8) -Modified Duran and Houser technique(6) -The patient starts passive flexion and extension exercises (twice per day) on the third postoperative day while the wrist is flexed and the MP joints are flexed to 70\u00b0 -At approximately 5 weeks postoperatively, the patient starts blocking exercises -At approximately 7 weeks postoperatively, the patient starts gentle resistive exercises \u2013Early active motion protocol(6) -Patients begin active tendon gliding within the first 48 hours post repair in a controlled and protected manner(2) -This protocol is appropriate only for specific suture strand repairs due to high rates of tendon rupture if utilized with other types of repairs(6,11) -Results of a biomechanical study designed to assess the strength of common core suture repairs indicate that braided cruciate repairs provided strength similar to 6- and 8-strand repairs(18) -Most active mobilization protocols incorporate a tenodesis orthosisthat is applied 3 to 5 days post-surgery  which limits wrist and MCP extension but allows digit flexion using tenodesis. At 7\u201314 days after surgery place-hold  exercises are initiated and at 14 to 21 days AAROM using buddy strapping is started. The program is progressed to AROM at 28 days after surgery and full active wrist and digit extension at 35 days. Use of the orthosis is discontinued at 7 to 9 weeks after repair(2) -The particular progression of the protocol depends on the surgeon -The type and amount of active mobilization varies with each protocol.All limit active tendon gliding during weeks 1\u20133(2)",
            "An ultrasonographic study of flexor tendon excursions in different mobilization protocols was conducted in the Netherlands to assess the effect of the position of adjacent fingers on long finger FDP tendon excursion(7) \u2013Studies have indicated that the surrounding tissue moves in the same direction as the tendon, so that tendon movement relative to the surrounding tissue may be smaller than absolute tendon movement \u2013Hence, it may be misleading to study tendon excursions measured with respect to a nonmoving reference such as a ruler or a bone \u2013The investigators hypothesized that the positions of adjacent fingers influence the long finger FDP excursion \u2013Using frame-to-frame  analysis of ultrasound images, long finger FDP tendon excursions and surrounding tissue movement were measured in 11 healthy subjects during 3 different rehabilitation protocols and 2 experimental protocols -Active 4-finger  mobilization protocol -Passive 4-finger  mobilization protocol -Modified Kleinert mobilization protocol -Experimental model based on modified Kleinert but with adjacent fingers in full flexion -Experimental model based on modified Kleinert but with adjacent fingers in full extension \u2013Large and significant differences among the different rehabilitation protocols and experimental models were observed in absolute and relative tendon displacement \u2013The positions of the adjacent fingers during tendon mobilization protocols have a large influence on tendon excursions  \u2013It was concluded that the most commonly used protocols may not lead to optimal tendon excursions and that clinicians should also focus on adjacent fingers during rehabilitation after tendon repair",
            "Authors of a systematic review designed to identify the optimal postoperative rehabilitation program found insufficient evidence to support true active motion regimens as superior to other motion approaches(33) . Problem Goal Intervention Expected Progression Home Program Patient at risk for tendon reinjuryProtect tendon repair Immobilization _ Immobilization with a cast for 3 to 4 weeks for children, noncompliant or impulsive patients, and patients with extensive hand injuries or impaired cognition _ _ Splinting _ A dorsal blocking splint/orthosis is fabricated, with the length (forearm-based versus hand-based) depending on the zone of the repair and surgeon\u2019s orders. Generally, the wrist should be in 20\u201330\u00b0 of flexion, all MCPs in 20\u201350\u00b0 of flexion, and the PIP and DIP joints fully extended.(3,5) _ Hinged dorsal tenodesis splints for early active use may be applied per physician ordersAt 3 weeks, the wrist may be brought into neutral. The splint will be required for approximately 5 weeks, at which time the patient may be gradually weaned from splint use with the permission of the hand surgeon(5)Educate patient on importance of protecting the surgically repaired tendon  Educate patient on importance of protecting the surgically repaired tendonPrevent tendon adherence; decrease scar formationTherapeutic exercise _ Modified Duran and Houser\u2019s controlled passive gliding technique (3rd postoperative day to 4 weeks postoperatively)(5,6) _ _ Kleinert/Louisville exercises (0\u20136 weeks)(5,6) _ _ Early active motion protocol.

At this time, blocking exercises of the PIP and DIP joints may be used to help isolate each joint. Adequate support to the proximal joint is necessary to allow for isolated flexion and extension of the joint. The patient may perform these on all of the affected digits, performing 3 sets of 15 repetitions. Nerve and tendon gliding (hook fist, full fist, straight fist, tabletop) may also be incorporated using 10 repetitions of each position 2\u20133 times per day(5,6) _ _ _ Modalities Ultrasound, contrast or paraffin baths, and whirlpool may be used to promote wound healing and ROM in the later stages of therapy(3)Extension PROM may be limited, as excessive extension can cause the tendon to be over-stretched or to re-rupture. At 6\u20138 weeks, extension PROM of the affected digit can be performed with the wrist in flexion to protect the repair, and within the parameters set by the hand surgeon(6) _ _ A flexion or extension dynamic splint may be initiated at 6 weeks to regain flexion or extension(5,6)Home exercise program should include appropriate ROM exercises to further promote ROM improvements Decreased strength Improve strength Therapeutic exercise _ Gentle and progressive strengthening may be initiated at approximately postoperative week 6(5) with physician orderResistive exercise can be progressed with resistive equipmentResistive exercise can be progressed with resistive equipment  Impaired hand function with impaired ADLsRestore normal hand function and ADLsFunctional training _ After 8 weeks (depending on surgeon and patient), incorporate functional strengthening and exercises for the hand and upper extremity. These may include weightlifting, repetitive motion tasks, dexterity tasks (e.g., braiding, spinning jacks, threading needles, unlocking padlocks), and other patient- specific activities, as appropriate(5)Restrict hand use for first 4 weeks _ Progress each unique patient as appropriate and indicatedProvide activities for home focused on the restoration of function as appropriate Surgical complications including poor wound healing and scar issues such as hypersensitivity, hypertrophyMinimize surgical complicationsMonitor for infection and appropriate immobilization of healing wound _ _ Modalities Ultrasound, contrast or paraffin baths, and whirlpool may be used to promote wound healing and ROM in the later stages of therapy(3)Progress each patient as appropriate and indicatedProvide education for self-monitoring of wound and scar ."
