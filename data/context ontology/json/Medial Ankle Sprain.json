            "Ankle sprains are one of the most common sports-related  musculoskeletal injuries,(18) with approximately 600,000 persons sustaining an ankle sprain annually in the Netherlands and 23,000 and 5,000 occurring daily in the United States and United Kingdom, respectively(17)",
            "Most ankle sprains (85%) involve the lateral ligaments.(3) The anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL) is the most commonly sprained lateral ankle ligament, followed by the calcaneofibular ligament (CFL). Infrequently, the posterior talofibular ligament (PTFL) is affected(4,19)",
            "A medial ankle sprain will involve the deltoid ligament on the medial aspect of the ankle. Medial (eversion) ankle sprains make up only 5% of all ankle sprains due to the strength of the deltoid ligament, which resists tears(3)",
            "A syndesmotic ankle sprain, or high ankle sprain, is an injury that involves the interosseous ligament between the distal tibia and fibula",
            "Ankle sprains do not only damage the ligaments, but also the mechanoreceptors within the ligaments, the joint capsule, and the retinacula around the joint, which provides information about joint movement and position(30)",
            "It has been reported that 3% to 34% of patients complain of persistent pain, swelling, a giving-way  sensation, re-sprain,  and/or limitations in activities and sports participation, and 10% to 20% complain of persistent instability.(17) When complaints persist for greater than 6 months, the term chronic ankle instability (CAI) is used(29,30) \u2013There are two primary components of CAI(30,31) -Mechanical instability: the result of pathological laxity, impaired arthrokinematics, and joint degeneration -Functional instability: the subjective perception of instability, the result of altered neuromuscular control, strength deficits, and impaired postural control \u2013There is no gold standard for diagnosing CAI; manual laxity testing may only be useful for ruling in the condition(49) \u2013Those with CAI are at increased risk for developing osteoarthritis and often are unable to return to prior level of function(49) ",
            "A major issue for medical professionals is determining when an athlete is ready for return-to-play  (RTP)(30) \u2013One reason many athletes end up with CAI is that they return to play before they are sufficiently healed \u2013Mechanical laxity can be present up to 1 year after an ankle sprain"
