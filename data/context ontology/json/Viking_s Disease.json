            "In advanced stages, Dupuytren\u2019s contracture (DC)is a fixed flexion deformity of the digit(s) due to abnormal collagen formation by myofibroblasts(1)",
            "DC is characterized by abnormal thickening, tightening, and cording of the palmar fascia (palmar fascial fibromatosis) that causes the fingers to flex. The 3rd through 5th digits are most commonly involved, rarely the thumb or index finger(1)",
            "The flexion deformities may become fixed. DC can, therefore, lead to disability in hand function, especially grasping and gripping(1)",
            "Radiation therapy that targets the hyperactive myofibroblasts may be tried in early stages to reduce disease progression, but evidence supporting its use is inconclusive.(20) In cases in which function is compromised, invasive procedures (e.g., percutaneous fasciotomy, open fasciotomy, fasciectomy) are indicated to correct the deformity and improve function.(6) Postoperative treatment usually involves hand therapy, with or without night splinting,(1) as well as daytime splinting (with splint removed for ROM exercises). Recurrences are not uncommon",
            "Collagenase fasciotomy is a minimally invasive enzymatic technique that dissolves the abnormal myofibroblasts with synthetic injectable collagenase developed from Clostridium histolyticum. The collagenase is injected into the cords and the following day passive extension is applied to rupture the cords. This proceduredecreases the contracture and improves ROM in patients with DC(5)"

            "A corrective procedure (e.g., fasciectomy, needle aponeurotomy, collagenase injection) is often the treatment of choice. Post-intervention  treatment typically addresses ROM, edema, pain, wound healing, and scar management (based on the patient needs)(32)",
            "The authors of a small (N = 30) pilot study conducted in Belgium found that use of either a tension or compression orthosis resulted in significant improvement in extension in patients with both new (i.e., non-operated)  or recurrent flexion contractures after 3 months of orthosis use(25) \u2013Single-blind  study \u2013Orthosis was prescribed to be used for 20 hours per day for 3 months, but actual usage was not recorded \u2013Significantly improved joint extension for both the tension and compression orthoses",
            "Management following collagenase injection is similar to postoperative care \u2013There is a paucity of strong evidence for the use of specific therapy techniques and orthoses following surgery or collagenase injections(18) -An insufficient number of quality studies and a general inability to accurately measure compliance with orthoses or therapy have been reported(18)  \u2013In a study conducted in the United States, patients managed with collagenase injections where the PIP joint flexion contractures were greater than 40\u02da had better outcomes at 4 weeks with use of an extension orthosis and a therapy program compared to a night extension orthosis and no therapy(19) . Problem Goal Intervention Expected Progression Home Program  Postsurgical wound, pain, and edemaProtection and promotion of healingOrthoses  Following surgery, the affected digits often are placed into a volar hand- or forearm-based orthosis with digit extension. Timing will vary with operative procedure.Typically the splint is wornwhen not exercising initially and then at night only (10,13)The evidence supporting splinting is equivocal with regard to motion, but it may be helpful for pain management.(26) _ The patient should be instructed to remove the splint frequently to check for areas of redness or irritation. If any part of the splint is irritating the skin or is too tight, modifications should be made immediately (padding, widening of the splint, etc.) by the appropriate therapist _ _ Edema management _ The reduction of edema in the affected areas should be one of the first goals. Coban wrapping, neoprene sleeves, digit caps, JOBST compression gloves, and other similar products may be used. Retrograde massage of the wrist, hand, and fingers can also be incorporated into the therapy program. Patient should be educated to maintain elevation in the acute phase postoperatively/ postinjection. _ There is limited evidence for the effectiveness of intermittent compression compared with constant compression for edema control following surgery for DC(13) _ _ Ice to reduce pain, swelling, and edema after therapy sessions may be beneficialManual therapy _ Scar massage to reduce scar thickness and adherence once appropriate healing has occurredCompliance with splinting, elevation of the extremity, and the use of scar and edema management tools should be incorporated into the home program as appropriate, as well as skin inspection  Reduced ROM Improve ROM Therapeutic exercise _ Active ROM: Composite flexion and extension as well as blocking exercises of the PIP (and DIP) joints should be performed, with an emphasis on achieving maximal extension of the PIP joint with each repetition. Adequate support to the proximal joint is necessary to allow for isolated flexion and extension of the joint. These exercises may be performed in 3 sets of 15\u201325 repetitions. The frequency and number of repetitions should be adjusted based on the patient\u2019s response to the exercises _ _ Nerve and tendon gliding (hook fist, full fist, straight fist, tabletop) may also be incorporated. The frequency and number of repetitions should be adjusted based on the patient\u2019s response to the exercises _ _ Stretching exercises: Gentle, passive stretching of the PIP joint to help restore extension. Self-stretching by the patient. Care should be taken to avoid being overly aggressive, which may result in increased pain, edema, and inflammation _ _ Casting motion to mobilize stiffness (CMMS): A specially designed cast may be used to apply a low-load, prolonged stress to optimize plastic deformation. Results of a case series showed positive results of CMMS on persistent digital stiffness following DC fasciectomy. The CMMS technique was initiated after an average of 9.5 weeks and 15 \u201ctraditional\u201d therapy sessions.(3) _ Dynamic extension splinting may be used to increase PIP extension as appropriate based on healing _ _Blocking and nerve/ tendon gliding exercises should be performed 10 times each hourly, or as tolerated (goal 3 to 5 times per day)  Reduced strength Improve strength Therapeutic exercise _ Strengthening should begin with active ROM of the affected digit, followed by gentle manual resistance, progressing to grip strengthening activities, including therapy putty, clothespins, dynagrips, Flexi-Grips, and other hand-strengthening equipment. These exercises should be performed after wound healing occurs and in a pain-free range, progressed slowly to the patient\u2019s tolerance. _ Wrist strengthening exercises should be initiated once wound healing occurs to increase wrist flexion/ extension and forearm pronation/supination. Strengthening should begin with active ROM, progressing to resistive exercises using dumbbells and weighted sticks. These exercises should be performed in a pain-free range and progressed slowly to the patient\u2019s tolerance _ _ Physical agents/ mechanical modalities _ Ice/cold for management of pain, edema. _ Moist heat pack to increase tissue elasticity prior to retrograde massage and stretching exercises _Strengthening and functional activities are added later after incision healing _ _ Progress each unique patient as appropriate and indicatedProvide strengthening activities for home as indicated  Decline in function, poor coordination and dexterityRestore prior functional capacity in daily activities and/or sports, with normal hand functionFunctional activities _ Recommend and implement appropriate functional tasks as indicated by stage of healing, tolerance, and physician orders. _ Coordination and dexterity exercises _ _ Adaptive equipment recommendations for activities that involve gripping or repetitive hand use(1)Length of rehabilitation generally reflects invasiveness of surgical procedure.(1) Limited fasciotomy may take 4\u20136 weeks, more extensive surgery may take 3\u20136 months _ _ Progress each unique patient as appropriate and indicatedProvide functional activities for home as indicated Possibility for complications such as hematoma formation or CRPSReduce risk of complications where possiblePatient education _ Education about compliance with postoperative therapy may help reduce complications(32) _ _ Patient expectations should be discussed prior to operative intervention.
