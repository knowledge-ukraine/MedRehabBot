            "It is important that the OT develop a trusting and respectful relationship with the patient in order to increase the patient\u2019s motivation for therapy; when listening to the patient discuss his or her thoughts and beliefs, the OT must fully attend to and not dismiss the patient\u2019s feelings because of the underlying depression(11)",

Also, no significant difference was found between use of antidepressant medication and exercise for alleviation of the symptoms of depression \u2013A Cochrane review of exercise for patients with depression concluded that although it is reasonable to recommend exercise for patients with depression, it was not possible to determine how effective exercise is as a treatment method(24) -The review authors found that exercise had a large effect on depressive symptoms in patients with a diagnosis of depression when compared to no treatment; however, it is likely that the results are biased toward exercise because of methodological reasons -Authors also recommended that patients find a form of exercise that is personally enjoyable, as long-term  exercise will have the best overall results and dropout rates for exercise programs can be high \u2013Authors of a systematic review and meta-analysis  of 5 RCTs examining the effectiveness of exercise for postnatal depression found that when compared with no exercise, exercise reduced symptoms of depression in women with postnatal depression(25) -Authors of the study cautioned readers regarding the interpretation of these results, as the heterogeneity of the studies made it difficult to draw firm conclusions -Additionally, the effect size was greatly reduced when the analysis excluded a trial that examined exercise as a co-intervention  along with social support",
