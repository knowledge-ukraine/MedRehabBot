Two RCTs that met the researchers\u2019 inclusion criteria had very small sample sizes, limiting the conclusions on the efficacy of this procedure(30) Sympathectomy destroys the nerves involved in CRPS,(9) either surgically or via injection of agents such as phenol(24) Spinal cord or brain stimulation may be useful in decreasing pain in some patients(24) Results from a systematic review and meta-analysis  indicate that spinal cord stimulation (SCS) decreases pain and need for pain medications, increases perceived quality of life, and facilitates the resumption of employment in patients with CRPS type I(18) Authors of a small United Kingdom study involving 3 adults using SCS suggest that although patients report increased independence with activities, they also experience feelings of dependence on the SCS, a lack of control over their future, and a perceived lack of understanding of their condition by others(32)",

Studies suggest topical ketamine can reduce allodynia and hyperalgesia but does not help with pain. IV ketamine may also be administered(1)  Results from a multicenter, double-blind  RCT in Italy suggest that patients with acute CRPS type I can achieve clinically significant improvements in pain and quality of life after receiving 4 IV infusions of neridronate, a bisphosphonate(33) Eighty-two  adults with CRPS type I were randomly assigned to either the neridronate group or a placebo group Subjects received 4 IV infusions of 100mg of neridronate over a 10-day  period Within the first 20 days after receiving neridronate, visual analog scale (V AS) scores decreased significantly over the placebo group. Over the next 20 days, selfreported  pain continued to decrease, whereas the placebo group remained unchanged After the 40-day  period, individuals in the placebo group were given the 4 doses of neridronate One year following the treatment intervention, none of the patients from both groups reported symptoms of CRPS type I Results from a 2013 Cochrane review suggest there is no evidence to support the use of topiramate, an antiepileptic drug, for the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain(34) Four RCTs with 1,684 participants met the inclusion criteria All studies had one or more sources of potential major bias There was no convincing evidence of efficacy of topiramate (200 to 400mg/day) over a placebo",

            "Research evidence is limited regarding the efficacy of treatment for CRPS \u2013Authors of a 2013 Cochrane review indicate there is a critical lack of high-quality  evidence for the effectiveness of most interventions for CRPS. It is difficult to develop an evidence-based  approach to managing CRPS until further larger trials are completed(24) -This Cochrane review included 6 previously published Cochrane reviews and 13 non-Cochrane  reviews -Trials were typically small and of variable quality -Graded motor imagery may be effective for pain and function compared with typical treatment intervention, and mirror therapy may be effective for individuals with poststroke CRPS \u2013Authors of a systematic review of RCTs published during the period 2000\u20132012  indicate strong evidence for the efficacy of just 3 treatments: bisphosphonates, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), and graded motor imagery(23) -Evidence was strong against 1 treatment (blockade with guanethidine) and moderate or limited against 14 other treatments -Overall, the level of evidence from RCTs for the efficacy of interventions to relieve pain in CRPS was unsatisfactory. Novel treatments have recently been effective in small RCTs. Larger studies with longer follow-up  are needed \u2013Pain exposure physical therapy (PEPT) is a new treatment that has been evaluated in retrospective and prospective studies and found to be safe and possibly effective(27) -PEPT consists of a progressive-loading  exercise program and management of pain avoidance behavior without the use of specific CRPS medication or analgesics -PEPT aims to decrease kinesiophobia, pain behavior, and learned nonuse through functional activity -Pain relief itself is not a primary treatment goal -An increase in pain during or after the exercises and activities may occur -Patients are instructed in self-massage  and forced use of the affected limb in order to desensitize beyond their pain limits \u2013Results from an Indian study indicate that the combination of high-frequency  TENS and exercise therapy may be more effective than the combination of low-frequency  TENS and exercise therapy or than exercise therapy alone to reduce pain associated with CRPS(19) -This study included 30 patients with CRPS who received high-frequency  TENS and exercise therapy, low-frequency TENS and exercise therapy, or exercise therapy alone \u2013Results from a systematic review of physical therapy interventions for the treatment of CRPS type I suggest graded motor imagery can decrease pain in adult patients (> 18 years) with CRPS type I(20) -The review included 5 RCTs, 1 comparative study, and 5 case series -During graded motor imagery, the patient looks at a photograph of a foot or hand and imagines moving his or her affected hand or foot into the position depicted in the photograph. The patient progresses to moving both limbs into the position while watching the unaffected limb in a mirror(21) -The authors concluded there is solid evidence for the use of graded motor imagery but there is insufficient evidence for the use of other treatments such as stress loading therapy \u2013Investigators in studies of treatment of CRP (28,29) emphasize the importance of an interdisciplinary approach that includes physical rehabilitation and cognitive behavioral therapy \u2013It is suggested that the four key components to managing patients with CRPS are patient/caregiver education, intense physical rehabilitation, pain management, and psychological interventions(1,2,3,4,5) -Intense physical therapy programs, some as much as 6 hours per day, have been described -In refractory cases, inpatient admission for rehabilitation for several days to weeks(29) or a day-hospital  interdisciplinary approach can be successful and cost-effective  in managing individuals who have failed to improve with outpatient"
