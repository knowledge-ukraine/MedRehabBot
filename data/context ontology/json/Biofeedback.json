        "title": " \u2013In a study to evaluate electrical activation of the quadriceps muscles during weight-bearing  tasks using the Wii Fit Plus, researchers in Brazil found that real-time  feedback did not alter quadriceps activation during the Wii tasks and that participants in these games showed EMG activation levels similar to those for the same tasks outside the virtual environment(25) -Thirty healthy volunteers participated -Activation of quadriceps muscles was recorded during lunge, single leg extension, and single leg reach while exercises were repeated with visual feedback, with auditory feedback, and with no feedback \u2013The addition of EMG biofeedback to an isometric exercise program has been reported to produce greater increases in muscle strength, greater reduction in pain intensity, and more improvement in functional status compared to isometric exercise alone in patients with OA of the knee(18) -Authors of an RCT in Korea studied the effects of biofeedback on maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC), pain, and muscle thickness in 30 older females (> 65 years) with knee osteoarthritis (OA)(18) -Patients were divided into three groups. Group 1 received electromyographic biofeedback (EMGBF) training, group 2 received ultrasound biofeedback (USBF), and group 3, which served as the control,received a hot pack, ultrasound, and TENS -Subjects in each group received treatment for 20 minutes, 3 times a week for 8 weeks -Outcome measures included MVIC, pain using a V AS, and vastusmedialis oblique thickness -MVIC showed significant increases in the EMGBF and USBF groups compared to the control group. The V AS pain rating significantly decreased in the EMGBF and USBF groups compared to the control group. Only the EMGBF group showed a significantly increased VMO thickness compared to pre-training \u2013Researchers in the United States investigated the effects of weight-bearing biofeedback training on functional movement patterns after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in an RCT(26) -Twenty-six  patients were randomly assigned to receive standard of care augmented with weight-bearing  biofeedback training or dose-matched  standard of care rehabilitation -Outcome measures included lower limb weight-bearing  ratios measured during the 5-times  sit-to-stand  test (FTSST) and during walking, as well as FTSST scores, walking speed, and lower limb joint moments -Results indicated that the biofeedback did not have an effect on functional weight-bearing  symmetry or knee extension moments during the FTSST, but that it did result in increases of knee extension moments during gait as well as improved scores on the FTSST \u2013Researchers in Canada compared the effectiveness of mirror training, raw video, and real-time  visual biofeedback for training toe-out  gait in individuals with knee OA(19) -A repeated-measures,  within-subject  trial was performed on 20 subjects -Participants were trained to walk on a treadmill while matching a target indicating a 10-degree  increase in stance phase toe-out  compared to the toe-out  angle measured during habitual walking. All subjects performed a trial each of the three types of feedback (mirror, raw video, and real-time visual biofeedback) in random order -Real-time  biofeedback demonstrated a significant decrease in toe-out performance error compared to the other feedback groups \u2013Biofeedback relaxation is effective for decreasing pain associated with continuous passive motion (CPM) in patients post-TKA(17) -Sixty-six  patients were included post-TKA  while admitted to a general hospital in Taiwan. Patients were randomly assigned to the intervention group (biofeedback during CPM) or the control group (CPM without biofeedback) -Pain was measured before and after each CPM session, which occurred twice daily for 5 days. A numeric pain rating scale was used to measure perceived pain \u2013Researchers in the United States investigated the effects of haptic (vibratory/vibrotactile) biofeedback on lower-extremity partial weight bearing(9) -Thirty healthy participants were randomly assigned to one of the three groups: verbal instruction, bathroom scale training, and haptic biofeedback    -The haptic biofeedback group averaged significantly better outcomes for partial weight-bearing  compliance compared to either control group \u2013Researchers in Poland compared the effectiveness of posturographic platform biofeedback training to conventional therapy in 21 patients post stroke(11) -Dynamic balance was measured with the TUG test -Post interventions, balance scores of patients in the biofeedback group were significantly higher than those of the conventional therapy control group -Greater improvements with biofeedback training were observed in participants with right-sided  hemiparesis compared to participants with left-sided  hemiparesis \u2013In patients with chronic stroke, trunk stabilization exercises with pressure biofeedback have been reported to significantly increase the thickness of trunk muscles and improve static and dynamic sitting balance ability more than trunk stabilization exercises alone(30) -Based on an RCT in South Korea involving 43 patients who were more than 6 months post-stroke  who could sit and walk independently -Experimental group received trunk stabilization training with audiovisual feedback for 50 minutes/day, 5 days a week, for 5 weeks and the control group received the same without feedback \u2013Researchers concluded that biofeedback functional electrical stimulation (BF-FES)  with mirror therapy resulted in significant improvement in upper extremity motor recovery and improved quality of life post stroke(12) -Twenty-nine  patients post stroke (> 6 months prior) were randomly assigned to one of three groups: BF-FES  plus mirror therapy, functional electric stimulation (FES) plus mirror therapy, or conventional therapy without BF-FES  or FES -The BF-FES  group showed significant improvement in wrist extension (ROM) and strength (MMT). The BF-FES  group also demonstrated significant improvement in the Box and Block Test (BBT), Jebsen Taylor Hand Function (JTHF), and Stroke Specific Quality of Life (SSQOL) when compared to both of the other groups \u2013Real-time  biofeedback can reduce knee adduction moment in patients with knee OA who are undergoing gait retraining(28) -Based on a systematic review of 12 studies -Evidence for the use of real-time  biofeedback for gait retraining in healthy controls was strong; evidence for patients with OA is limited but promising -Limitations of the review were that most studies were small and all but one were uncontrolled/nonrandomized -Authors found insufficient evidence to determine the optimal means of delivery for biofeedback \u2022Urinary and bowel systems and pelvic floor muscle dysfunction \u2013Evidence for efficacy and safety of biofeedback for management of chronic constipation is inconclusive(20) -Based on a Cochrane systematic review of RCTs (n = 17) evaluating biofeedback and chronic idiopathic constipation in the adult population (n = 931 subjects) -Various types of biofeedback were utilized, with EMG the most commonly used -Due to low or very low-quality  evidence and the wide variation in participants, interventions, selected outcome measures, duration of treatment, and follow-up  post treatment, no firm conclusions can be drawn regarding the use of biofeedback for the management of chronic constipation -Additional high-quality  research is warranted \u2013Researchers in China compared intensive with nonintensive biofeedback therapy for treatment of patients with constipation-related  symptoms in a retrospective cohort study involving 63 patients(27) -Biofeedback training involved training to relax the anal sphincter, enhance sensory perception, and improve rectoanal coordination to increase pushing effort based on intra-abdominal  and intrarectal pressures -Intensive therapy was defined as a treatment either once per day or every other day; nonintensive therapy was defined as treatment twice a week. Each patient received 16 training sessions -Outcome measures included symptoms of defecation difficulty such as hard stools, incomplete bowel movement, and low stool volume, graded on a 0 to 3 scale, as well as usage of medications and impact on social activities and work -There was a significant improvement in constipation-related  symptoms after adaptive feedback in both groups. The intensive biofeedback therapy did not show better performance compared to nonintensive biofeedback therapy -The authors concluded that biofeedback training improved constipation and that nonintensive therapy was as effective as intensive therapy, despite the potential for the longer time required to complete 16 training sessions to have a negative impact on compliance    \u2013Biofeedback was shown to be an effective treatment for children with various types of bladder dysfunction(21,22) -Authors of a study in Turkey compared the effectiveness of biofeedback therapy in children with dysfunctional voiding (DV) and refractory overactive bladder (OAB)(21) -Forty-five  children had 3 months of biofeedback treatment -In patients with DV , significant improvements were found in multiple factors including urinary tract infections, urge incontinence, and fractionated voiding. In patients with OAB, significant improvements included fewer urinary tract infections, normalized frequency, and decreased urge incontinence -Overall, biofeedback treatment showed greater improvements in patients with DV compared to patients with OAB \u2013Authors of an RCT in Iran studied the effects of animated biofeedback and pelvic floor muscle exercise in children with non-neuropathic  underactive bladder(UB)(22) -Fifty children with UB, ages 5\u201316  years, were randomly divided into two groups. Group A received standard urotherapy (hydration, scheduled voiding, toilet training, and diet management), animated biofeedback, and pelvic floor muscle exercise. Group B received the same interventions as group A except for animated biofeedback and pelvic floor muscle exercise -The addition of biofeedback and pelvic floor muscle exercise to a standard bladder program more effectively improved the sensation of bladder fullness and contractility in children with UB \u2013In 2014, the authors of a systematic review studied the role of biofeedback and soft tissue mobilization in middle-aged women with dyspareunia(23) -Both biofeedback and soft tissue mobilization significantly reduced pain and improved sexual function -Gains were maintained for up to 12 months -Client preference and comfort as well as clinical expertise must be considered when selecting appropriate treatment for dyspareunia \u2013Authors of a systematic review and meta-analysis  conducted in Taiwan found biofeedback training to be a useful adjunct treatment option for performing muscle reduction training for the pelvic floor muscle groups in order to reduce urinary incontinence in patients who have undergone radical prostatectomy(33) \u2013Authors of another systematic review conducted in Brazil concluded that biofeedback training may have use in improving continence and bladder function in patients who have undergone a prostatectomy. However, only four studies met the inclusion criteria for this study; thus, further research may be warranted(34) \u2022Disorders affecting the head and neck \u2013Authors of a small RCT (n = 12) in Japan who investigated the effects of biofeedback training on bruxism found a significant decrease in symptoms after the 2 to 3 weeks of biofeedback training compared to a control group(14) \u2013In 2014, researchers who conducted an RCT in Iran compared biofeedback therapy to conventional therapy (non-biofeedback)  in patients with facial nerve dysfunction(13) -Twenty-nine  subjects who had facial nerve dysfunction (Bell\u2019s palsy, tumor, or trauma) were divided into two groups. Group 1 was treated with biofeedback electromyography. Group 2 was treated with conventional therapy. All patients received 1 year of treatment -Outcome measures included evaluation of facial grading scale before and after treatment and severity of synkinesia (involuntary movement occurs coordinated with a voluntary movement), both of which improved significantly more in the biofeedback group \u2022Abdominal muscle impairment \u2013Real-time  ultrasound was found to selectively enhance the recruitment of transversus abdominis and the internal obliques as compared to the external obliques during abdominal hollowing exercise (AHE) in healthy subjects(31) -Based on a prospective, randomized, parallel-group,  comparative study conducted in South Korea with 20 healthy subjects -The experimental group received a real-time  ultrasound and conventional feedback from a physiatrist during AHE while the control group received conventional feedback only. Both groups trained 20 minutes a session, 3 times a week, for 2 consecutive weeks -Outcome measures were muscle thickness, measured by ultrasonography, and surface EMG muscle activity \u2013In a study in the United States researchers measured changes in muscle thickness pre-/post-exercise  and biofeedback in persons with low back pain(16)    -Patients were divided equally into exercise without biofeedback or exercise with biofeedback groups. Exercise for both groups included one session of abdominal and back stabilization. Biofeedback included visual, auditory, and tactile components -No statistical differences were found between groups. Results demonstrated an increase in transverse abdominis preferential ratio; no thickness changes occurred in the lumbar multifidus muscles \u2022Other \u2013Authors of a meta-analysis  concluded that heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback was associated with a large reduction in perceived stress and anxiety(32) -Based on 24 studies totaling 484 participants who received HRV biofeedback training for stress and anxiety \u2013Biofeedback has been used to effectively treat physiological components of psychological stress and anxiety(15) -Researchers who conducted an RCT in Australia investigated the effects of biofeedback combined with relaxation, mindfulness, social support, and education (RMSSE) in 40 patients with multiple sclerosis. Both groups received RMSSE with one group receiving the additional treatment of biofeedback -Both groups demonstrated significant improvement in anxiety and depression. The biofeedback group also showed significant improvement in breathing rate and muscle tension compared to the control group \u2022A biofeedback electronic system for balance was found to be an effective tool for those undergoing pre-prosthetic training(36) \u2013Based on an RCT of 40 patients with femoral amputations who were randomized to the biofeedback electronic systems group (n = 20) or control group (n = 20) See Description , Indications of device/equipment , and Guidelines for use of device/equipment , above .

            "Impairments of gait, balance, and lower extremity function \u2013Use of the Space Balance 3D training system combined with conventional physical therapy can be useful in improving the balance and mobility of patients with acute stroke(38) -Fifty-two  subjects with an acute stroke were randomized to either the experimental group (n = 26) or control group (n = 26) -The experimental group received conventional PT while also performing balance training exercises using the Space Balance 3D exercise program 5 times per week for 3 weeks -The experimental group showed significant improvements in the Berg Balance scale, TUG, and Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke Patients (PASS) compared to the control group, who received only standard physical therapy treatment \u2013Electromyographic biofeedback can be a useful intervention in reducing pain and improving quadriceps strength and performance in patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis(JRA)(37) -Based on an RCT of 36 children with polyarticular JRA who were randomized to either the control group (n = 18) or biofeedback group (n = 18) -Both groups received conventional physical therapy, but the biofeedback group also received EMG-biofeedback-guided isometric exercises 3 days a week for 12 weeks \u2013Authors of a systematic review have suggested that biofeedback training is a more effective treatment option than usual therapy in improving overall performance and activities of the lower extremities in individuals with a recent stroke(35) -Based on 8 trials with a total of 429 participants -Biofeedback was given concurrently during exercises and activities such as sitting, standing up, standing, and walking \u2013Researchers in Poland conducted an RCT to evaluate the effects of gait training with and without visual biofeedback in patients in the late period after stroke(10) -Fifty patients at least 6 months post-stroke  were randomly assigned to the intervention group (treadmill training with visual biofeedback) or the control group (treadmill training without biofeedback) -Outcome measures included spatiotemporal gait parameters, walking speed, walking distance, self-reliant  mobility, and functional capacity -Ten sessions were performed over a 2-week  period -Compared to the control group, participants in the intervention group demonstrated significantly greater improvement in shortening of the stance phase and lengthening of the swing phase of the unaffected limb -No other significant differences between groups were noted \u2013The addition of visual feedback to body-weight-supported  (BWS) treadmill training did not result in significant improvements in patients at an early stage after stroke(29)  -Based on an RCT in Poland involving 30 patients with subacute stroke in which both groups did 15 sessions of 30-minute  treadmill training -Outcome measures were spatiotemporal gait parameters (3D system), 2-minute walk test, 10-meter  walk test, and TUG test \u2013In a study to evaluate electrical activation of the quadriceps muscles during weight-bearing  tasks using the Wii Fit Plus, researchers in Brazil found that real-time  feedback did not alter quadriceps activation during the Wii tasks and that participants in these games showed EMG activation levels similar to those for the same tasks outside the virtual environment(25) -Thirty healthy volunteers participated -Activation of quadriceps muscles was recorded during lunge, single leg extension, and single leg reach while exercises were repeated with visual feedback, with auditory feedback, and with no feedback \u2013The addition of EMG biofeedback to an isometric exercise program has been reported to produce greater increases in muscle strength, greater reduction in pain intensity, and more improvement in functional status compared to isometric exercise alone in patients with OA of the knee(18) -Authors of an RCT in Korea studied the effects of biofeedback on maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC), pain, and muscle thickness in 30 older females (> 65 years) with knee osteoarthritis (OA)(18) -Patients were divided into three groups. Group 1 received electromyographic biofeedback (EMGBF) training, group 2 received ultrasound biofeedback (USBF), and group 3, which served as the control,received a hot pack, ultrasound, and TENS -Subjects in each group received treatment for 20 minutes, 3 times a week for 8 weeks -Outcome measures included MVIC, pain using a V AS, and vastusmedialis oblique thickness -MVIC showed significant increases in the EMGBF and USBF groups compared to the control group. The V AS pain rating significantly decreased in the EMGBF and USBF groups compared to the control group. Only the EMGBF group showed a significantly increased VMO thickness compared to pre-training \u2013Researchers in the United States investigated the effects of weight-bearing biofeedback training on functional movement patterns after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in an RCT(26) -Twenty-six  patients were randomly assigned to receive standard of care augmented with weight-bearing  biofeedback training or dose-matched  standard of care rehabilitation -Outcome measures included lower limb weight-bearing  ratios measured during the 5-times  sit-to-stand  test (FTSST) and during walking, as well as FTSST scores, walking speed, and lower limb joint moments -Results indicated that the biofeedback did not have an effect on functional weight-bearing  symmetry or knee extension moments during the FTSST, but that it did result in increases of knee extension moments during gait as well as improved scores on the FTSST \u2013Researchers in Canada compared the effectiveness of mirror training, raw video, and real-time  visual biofeedback for training toe-out  gait in individuals with knee OA(19) -A repeated-measures,  within-subject  trial was performed on 20 subjects -Participants were trained to walk on a treadmill while matching a target indicating a 10-degree  increase in stance phase toe-out  compared to the toe-out  angle measured during habitual walking. All subjects performed a trial each of the three types of feedback (mirror, raw video, and real-time visual biofeedback) in random order -Real-time  biofeedback demonstrated a significant decrease in toe-out performance error compared to the other feedback groups \u2013Biofeedback relaxation is effective for decreasing pain associated with continuous passive motion (CPM) in patients post-TKA(17) -Sixty-six  patients were included post-TKA  while admitted to a general hospital in Taiwan. Patients were randomly assigned to the intervention group (biofeedback during CPM) or the control group (CPM without biofeedback) -Pain was measured before and after each CPM session, which occurred twice daily for 5 days. A numeric pain rating scale was used to measure perceived pain \u2013Researchers in the United States investigated the effects of haptic (vibratory/vibrotactile) biofeedback on lower-extremity partial weight bearing(9) -Thirty healthy participants were randomly assigned to one of the three groups: verbal instruction, bathroom scale training, and haptic biofeedback  -The haptic biofeedback group averaged significantly better outcomes for partial weight-bearing  compliance compared to either control group \u2013Researchers in Poland compared the effectiveness of posturographic platform biofeedback training to conventional therapy in 21 patients post stroke(11) -Dynamic balance was measured with the TUG test -Post interventions, balance scores of patients in the biofeedback group were significantly higher than those of the conventional therapy control group -Greater improvements with biofeedback training were observed in participants with right-sided  hemiparesis compared to participants with left-sided  hemiparesis \u2013In patients with chronic stroke, trunk stabilization exercises with pressure biofeedback have been reported to significantly increase the thickness of trunk muscles and improve static and dynamic sitting balance ability more than trunk stabilization exercises alone(30) -Based on an RCT in South Korea involving 43 patients who were more than 6 months post-stroke  who could sit and walk independently -Experimental group received trunk stabilization training with audiovisual feedback for 50 minutes/day, 5 days a week, for 5 weeks and the control group received the same without feedback \u2013Researchers concluded that biofeedback functional electrical stimulation (BF-FES)  with mirror therapy resulted in significant improvement in upper extremity motor recovery and improved quality of life post stroke(12) -Twenty-nine  patients post stroke (> 6 months prior) were randomly assigned to one of three groups: BF-FES  plus mirror therapy, functional electric stimulation (FES) plus mirror therapy, or conventional therapy without BF-FES  or FES -The BF-FES  group showed significant improvement in wrist extension (ROM) and strength (MMT). The BF-FES  group also demonstrated significant improvement in the Box and Block Test (BBT), Jebsen Taylor Hand Function (JTHF), and Stroke Specific Quality of Life (SSQOL) when compared to both of the other groups \u2013Real-time  biofeedback can reduce knee adduction moment in patients with knee OA who are undergoing gait retraining(28) -Based on a systematic review of 12 studies -Evidence for the use of real-time  biofeedback for gait retraining in healthy controls was strong; evidence for patients with OA is limited but promising -Limitations of the review were that most studies were small and all but one were uncontrolled/nonrandomized -Authors found insufficient evidence to determine the optimal means of delivery for biofeedback",
            "Urinary and bowel systems and pelvic floor muscle dysfunction \u2013Evidence for efficacy and safety of biofeedback for management of chronic constipation is inconclusive(20) -Based on a Cochrane systematic review of RCTs (n = 17) evaluating biofeedback and chronic idiopathic constipation in the adult population (n = 931 subjects) -Various types of biofeedback were utilized, with EMG the most commonly used -Due to low or very low-quality  evidence and the wide variation in participants, interventions, selected outcome measures, duration of treatment, and follow-up  post treatment, no firm conclusions can be drawn regarding the use of biofeedback for the management of chronic constipation -Additional high-quality  research is warranted \u2013Researchers in China compared intensive with nonintensive biofeedback therapy for treatment of patients with constipation-related  symptoms in a retrospective cohort study involving 63 patients(27) -Biofeedback training involved training to relax the anal sphincter, enhance sensory perception, and improve rectoanal coordination to increase pushing effort based on intra-abdominal  and intrarectal pressures -Intensive therapy was defined as a treatment either once per day or every other day; nonintensive therapy was defined as treatment twice a week. Each patient received 16 training sessions -Outcome measures included symptoms of defecation difficulty such as hard stools, incomplete bowel movement, and low stool volume, graded on a 0 to 3 scale, as well as usage of medications and impact on social activities and work -There was a significant improvement in constipation-related  symptoms after adaptive feedback in both groups. The intensive biofeedback therapy did not show better performance compared to nonintensive biofeedback therapy -The authors concluded that biofeedback training improved constipation and that nonintensive therapy was as effective as intensive therapy, despite the potential for the longer time required to complete 16 training sessions to have a negative impact on compliance  \u2013Biofeedback was shown to be an effective treatment for children with various types of bladder dysfunction(21,22) -Authors of a study in Turkey compared the effectiveness of biofeedback therapy in children with dysfunctional voiding (DV) and refractory overactive bladder (OAB)(21) -Forty-five  children had 3 months of biofeedback treatment -In patients with DV , significant improvements were found in multiple factors including urinary tract infections, urge incontinence, and fractionated voiding. In patients with OAB, significant improvements included fewer urinary tract infections, normalized frequency, and decreased urge incontinence -Overall, biofeedback treatment showed greater improvements in patients with DV compared to patients with OAB \u2013Authors of an RCT in Iran studied the effects of animated biofeedback and pelvic floor muscle exercise in children with non-neuropathic  underactive bladder(UB)(22) -Fifty children with UB, ages 5\u201316  years, were randomly divided into two groups. Group A received standard urotherapy (hydration, scheduled voiding, toilet training, and diet management), animated biofeedback, and pelvic floor muscle exercise. Group B received the same interventions as group A except for animated biofeedback and pelvic floor muscle exercise -The addition of biofeedback and pelvic floor muscle exercise to a standard bladder program more effectively improved the sensation of bladder fullness and contractility in children with UB \u2013In 2014, the authors of a systematic review studied the role of biofeedback and soft tissue mobilization in middle-aged women with dyspareunia(23) -Both biofeedback and soft tissue mobilization significantly reduced pain and improved sexual function -Gains were maintained for up to 12 months -Client preference and comfort as well as clinical expertise must be considered when selecting appropriate treatment for dyspareunia \u2013Authors of a systematic review and meta-analysis  conducted in Taiwan found biofeedback training to be a useful adjunct treatment option for performing muscle reduction training for the pelvic floor muscle groups in order to reduce urinary incontinence in patients who have undergone radical prostatectomy(33) \u2013Authors of another systematic review conducted in Brazil concluded that biofeedback training may have use in improving continence and bladder function in patients who have undergone a prostatectomy. However, only four studies met the inclusion criteria for this study; thus, further research may be warranted(34)",
            "Disorders affecting the head and neck \u2013Authors of a small RCT (n = 12) in Japan who investigated the effects of biofeedback training on bruxism found a significant decrease in symptoms after the 2 to 3 weeks of biofeedback training compared to a control group(14) \u2013In 2014, researchers who conducted an RCT in Iran compared biofeedback therapy to conventional therapy (non-biofeedback)  in patients with facial nerve dysfunction(13) -Twenty-nine  subjects who had facial nerve dysfunction (Bell\u2019s palsy, tumor, or trauma) were divided into two groups. Group 1 was treated with biofeedback electromyography. Group 2 was treated with conventional therapy. All patients received 1 year of treatment -Outcome measures included evaluation of facial grading scale before and after treatment and severity of synkinesia (involuntary movement occurs coordinated with a voluntary movement), both of which improved significantly more in the biofeedback group",
            "Abdominal muscle impairment \u2013Real-time  ultrasound was found to selectively enhance the recruitment of transversus abdominis and the internal obliques as compared to the external obliques during abdominal hollowing exercise (AHE) in healthy subjects(31) -Based on a prospective, randomized, parallel-group,  comparative study conducted in South Korea with 20 healthy subjects -The experimental group received a real-time  ultrasound and conventional feedback from a physiatrist during AHE while the control group received conventional feedback only. Both groups trained 20 minutes a session, 3 times a week, for 2 consecutive weeks -Outcome measures were muscle thickness, measured by ultrasonography, and surface EMG muscle activity \u2013In a study in the United States researchers measured changes in muscle thickness pre-/post-exercise  and biofeedback in persons with low back pain(16)  -Patients were divided equally into exercise without biofeedback or exercise with biofeedback groups. Exercise for both groups included one session of abdominal and back stabilization. Biofeedback included visual, auditory, and tactile components -No statistical differences were found between groups. Results demonstrated an increase in transverse abdominis preferential ratio; no thickness changes occurred in the lumbar multifidus muscles"
