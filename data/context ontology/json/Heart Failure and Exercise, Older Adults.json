            "Prescription of aerobic exercise \u2013Guidelines: Specific exercise guidelines based on NYHA class that target patients with HF are lacking. Exercise standards for testing and training patients with heart conditions in general have been published by the American College of Sports Medicine(3) \u2013Medical supervision: A physician or clinical exercise therapist should write the exercise prescription and supervise the exercise program. A medical response protocol should be developed and rehearsed to manage various problems or emergencies that may occur during the exercise session \u2013Patient monitoring: HR, BP, and ECG monitoring during the exercise sessions may be necessary or prescribed by the referring physician on an individual patient basis \u2013Warm-up:  A patient should be given a warm-up  of at least 15 minutes of gentle exercise, which may include light calisthenics and stretching, prior to starting exercise in the prescribed aerobic intensity zone \u2013Patient orientation: The initial 2 weeks of the training program should be used to habituate the patient to the exercise modes at \u201clight\u201d or \u201ceasy\u201d RPE intensity, with the session relatively short in duration (15 to 20 minutes) \u2013Types of exercise: Stationary leg cycling, arm ergometry, and slow walking on a treadmill have been used successfully in research studies. Ambulatory patients with questionable gait safety assessed by DGI may require standby assistance when walking for exercise \u2013Exercise intensity: Avoid exercise-induced  symptoms such as muscle pain or dyspnea that may limit exercise duration. The upper limit of exercise intensity during the stimulus phase of training (in the absence of untoward symptoms) is 60% to 70% of heart-rate  reserve (calculated as the resting HR + peak HR \u2013 exercise HR) determined on graded exercise testing. This intensity is commonly perceived as \u201csomewhat hard\u201d (13 on Borg RPE Scale of 6 to 20) \u2013Exercise session duration: Target 40 minutes after the initial orientation period \u2013Exercise frequency: Target 3 to 4 times per week \u2013Exercise program duration: The duration of training can vary. In many studies the duration is approximately 12 weeks(10,11,12) \u2013Patients with ischemic heart failure with an implantable defibrillator can benefit from a 12-week  aerobic interval program to improve quality of life and depressive symptoms(11) -Based on a study in Norway that included 31 patients with ischemic heart failure with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator -Patients exercised 3x/week for 60 minutes using a cycle ergometer or treadmill. Exercise sessions were broken down into 15-minute  warm-ups,  followed by performing 4 high-intensity  intervals (85% of max HR or a 15\u201317  Borg Scale), and ending with a 20-minute cool-down  and stretching \u2013Aerobic interval training can improve diastolic function and cardiac power index in patients with heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction(12) -Based on a study of 120 patients with HF conducted in Taiwan. Patients were divided into the heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, or general healthcare groups -Patients performed aerobic interval training at 3-minute  intervals at 40% and 80% VO2peak for 30 minutes a day, 3x/ week for 12 weeks ",
            "Based on a 2018 systematic review and meta-analysis,  exercise significantly improves physical function and quality of life in patients with chronic heart failure(18) \u2013Data from 5411 patients with chronic heart failure from 40 studies were included in the analysis. The studies all included an outpatient or community-based  structured exercise program as the sole intervention \u2013The authors concluded that participation in exercise is more important than the type of exercise performed",
            "Dance exercise may improve exercise tolerance in patients with HF. Authors of an RCT (N = 51 men; mean age 67.1 years) in Greece found that traditional Greek dancing (60 minutes, 3 times a week for 8 months) improved aerobic functional capacity similar to conventional exercise training compared to controls, but the dance group had greater intrinsic motivation and attendance than the formal exercise group(5) \u2013The dancing group performed 10minutes of warming up followed by 40 minutes of basic, low-impact  steps, gradually progressing to more physically demanding dance steps \u2013The formal exercise group performed 10 minutes of warm-up followed by 20 minutes of aerobic and/or stationary bike exercise, followed by 20 minutes of resistance training of the upper and lower extremities",
            "Based on an RCT in Sweden, both yoga and hydrotherapy significantly improve exercise capacity and decrease anxiety in patients with heart failure(19) \u2013Forty patients with heart failure were randomized into two groups: hydrotherapy or yoga training \u2013Both groups performed interventions 45\u201360  minutes, twice a week for 12 weeks \u2013Both yoga and hydrotherapy interventions equally affected quality of life, exercise capacity, clinical outcomes, and symptoms of anxiety and depression",
            "Modified high-intensity  training (mHIT) can improve peak cardiac output and increase ventilation efficiency during exercise while reducing cardiac afterload for patients with heart failure(10) \u2013Researchers in Taiwan studied 68 patients (35 in mHIT group and 33 in control group) with heart failure for 12 weeks \u2013mHIT group performed moderate continuous training during the first 12 sessions followed by 24 HIT sessions. Intensity level was set at 40\u201360%  of VO 2 reserve. HIT activities consisted of a 6-minute  warm-up  at 20% VO 2 reserve followed by seven 3-minute  exercise intervals at 80% of VO2 reserve and finishing with a 5-minute cool-down  at 20% VO2 reserve. Sessions lasted a total of 50 minutes \u2013Patients in the control group received only medical treatment throughout the study \u2013Results at the end of the study show that those in the mHIT group had significant improvements in minute ventilation (VE/VO 2), heart rate, rate pressure product, and stroke volume compliance and elevated stroke volume and cardiac output",
            "Resistance training without additional intervention is effective for increasing aerobic capacity, muscle strength, and quality of life in patients with heart failure(17) \u2013Based on a meta-analysis  which included 10 studies and 240 participants ranging in age from 48 to 76 years \u2013Training durations in the selected studies ranged from 8 to 24 weeks. Intensity of resistance training was up to 80% 1RM .
