Dressings must be accommodated -Therapists need to consider skin integrity, edema, and proper fit of the device. The zone of stasis lies immediately beneath the burn and has compromised circulation.

In addition, the exercise group received 12 weeks of isokinetic training 3 times per week at an angular velocity of 150\u00b0 per second -Outcome measures included thigh circumference measure with a tape measure, gait parameters (velocity in m/ s, cadence in steps/min, step and stride length in cm) measured using the GAITRite mat (USA), and isokinetic quadriceps muscle strength (defined as peak torque at 150\u00b0/second). Similar data were obtained from a group of non-burned  healthy controls in order to determine deficits and progress during the training program -The isokinetic group had improved measured isokinetic quadriceps strength over the course of treatment, from ~ 47 ft-lbs  to ~ 79 ft-lbs  (p < 0.001).
