            "The Masako maneuver (also called the tongue-holding  maneuver) is one type of swallow maneuver used in swallowing therapy (also called dysphagia therapy). Swallow maneuvers are a collection of actions that a patient can perform during swallowing in order to increase the safety, efficiency, or adequacy of the swallow; swallow maneuvers are taught to patients by trained speech-language  pathologists (SLPs) during a course of dysphagia therapy.(1) (For detailed information on swallow maneuvers, see  Clinical Review ... Dysphagia: Swallowing Therapy -- Swallow Maneuvers -- an Overview  ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T709042 and the series of Clinical Reviews on each of the other specific types of maneuvers)",
            "The Masako maneuver is intended to increase posterior pharyngeal wall contraction, resulting in improved contact between the pharyngeal wall and the base of the tongue during the swallow, allowing for improved clearance of residue from the pharynx(2) \u2013This maneuver is accomplished by having the patient maximally protrude the tongue and asking him or her to hold the tongue between the teeth (central incisors) while swallowing(2) \u2013The retraction of the base of the tongue is restricted, causing increased bulging and stretching of the posterior pharyngeal wall during swallowing(2)",
            "Patients with severe cognitive deficits who are unable to follow the commands required to learn these maneuvers are not appropriate candidates for the Masako maneuver(3)",

            "Masako maneuver \u2013A maneuver intended to increase posterior pharyngeal wall contraction, resulting in improved contact between the pharyngeal wall and the base of the tongue during the swallow, allowing for improved clearance of residue from the pharynx(2) \u2013This maneuver is accomplished by having the patient maximally protrude the tongue and having him or her hold the tongue between the teeth (central incisors) while swallowing(2) -The retraction of the base of the tongue is restricted, causing increased bulging and stretching of the posterior pharyngeal wall during swallowing(2) \u2013The Masako maneuver appeared to increase the pressure between the tongue base and pharyngeal wall in a case study involving 3 patients with head and neck cancer and dysphagia (versus a nonmaneuverswallow)(22) -Might improve clearance of residue along the upper pharyngeal wall(22) \u2013In a research study conducted in the United States, 10 healthy males aged 19\u201326  years with no history of dysphagia were trained to perform this maneuver(2) -Patients were given 3-mL  boluses of barium liquid and asked to swallow 6 times; 3 times with the Masako maneuver and 3 times without the maneuver(2) -Videofluoroscopic swallow images were taken of all 6 swallows and compared(2) -In these healthy adult subjects, there was shown to be a significant difference in the amount of anterior bulge of the posterior pharyngeal wall when the subjects were performing the Masako maneuver(2) -The anterior bulge of the posterior pharyngeal wall during swallowing was significantly greater with the Masako maneuver at mid and inferior C2 level of the spine(2) \u2013In a case series with planned data collection study conducted in Japan, researchers examined the effects of the Masako maneuver in 33 nondysphagicadults(24) -Objective measurements were obtained with a high-resolution  manometry system during swallows.(24) Thirty-six sensors spaced 1cm apart were positioned throughout the pharynx and upper esophagus to record pressures at rest and during swallowing -The maximum values of the dry swallowing pressures at the velopharynx, mesohypopharynx, and upper esophageal sphincter (UES), as well as the distance from the nostril to each of these points of maximum value, were measured when the subjects swallowed with and without the Masako maneuver(24) -Researchers found that the distance from the nostril to the UES was significantly shorter when the subjects swallowed with the Masako maneuver than during swallows without it. Additionally, the researchers noted that the maximum pressure at the UES was higher during Masako maneuver swallows, but this finding was not statistically significant. No other differences were observed in pressures throughout the pharynx and upper esophagus(24) \u2013Authors of a study of 25 healthy adults compared respiratory coordination during swallows with the Masako maneuver and normal swallows(27)  -Participants swallowed a 10ml bolus with tongue-hold maneuver and with a normal swallow -Swallow apnea was measured by nasal airflow monitoring through a nasal cannula -Swallow apnea increased with the Masako maneuver.Exhalation occurring before and after the swallow remained the predominant respiratory pattern across Masako and normal swallows. The authors acknowledge the need for additional research in patients with respiratory impairments andreduced airway protection, andincludinginstrumental swallow"
