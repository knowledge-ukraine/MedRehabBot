The goal of hip surveillance is for orthopedic review to occur at the appropriate time -The recommended process includes clinical assessment and radiographs continuing until skeletal maturity, with frequency dependent on GMFCS level, radiographic changes, and age -Increased frequency of hip surveillance is required when hip musculoskeletal measurements have deteriorated (i.e., reduced ROM, reduced muscle length, or changes in muscle tone) or functions such as altered gait and decreased ability or tolerance for sitting or standing have deteriorated -Increased or newly developed asymmetry, or pain related to the hip, requires an increased surveillance or a referral to the orthopedic surgeon Motor function (motor control/tone/learning) \u2013Assess upper and lower extremities and trunk for abnormal tone \u2013Assess spasticity via Modified Ashworth Scale or Tardieu scale  -The Tardieu scale was found to have good to excellent intra-rater  and inter-rater  reliability when used to assess ankle plantar flexors or elbow flexors in a study involving 6 examiners; reliability was increased significantly following a training for 1day(25) -In the year 2013, authors of a systematic review suggest that there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of a single spasticity assessment tool over another tool. Nineteen studies examining 17 spasticity assessment tools were included. None of the assessment tools demonstrated satisfactory results for all psychometric properties. Furthermore, there was a lack of evidence regarding the absolute reliability, validity, and responsiveness of these tools. Scales such as the Modified Ashworth and Tardieu scale, which use ordinal scales, provide poor accuracy and reliability.

This pilot study demonstrated that the ankle strengthening may improve function and gait(31) -Data from 3 subjects were excluded for various reasons; final results were from 12 subjects -Comprised of 4 groups: plantar flexor (PF) strength training group; dorsiflexor (DF) strength training group; PF and DF strength training group; and control group -Training groups experienced: -Significant changes in muscle strength (measured via dynamometer) -Significant improvement in the GMFM-88  walk-run  dimension and quality of life measure \u2013Researchers in Taiwan conducted a randomized controlled trial involving 20 children with spastic diplegic CP to investigate the effectiveness of loaded sit-to-stand  (STS) resistance exercises and found significant improvements in the 1 repetition maximum of STS, GMFM-88  goal dimension scores, and physiological cost index(45) -Both the control and treatment groups participated in regular physical therapy regimens; the treatment group additionally performed loaded STS exercises 3 time per week for 6 weeks -Isometric knee extensor strength and gait speed did not change significantly in the treatment group when compared to the control group \u2013Authors of a randomized controlled trial conducted in Australia involving 21 children with spastic diplegic CP investigated the impact of a home-based strength training routine (heel raises, half squats, step-ups).  The study found significantly improved lower limb strength at 12 weeks after the 6-week training(46) -The treatment group exercised 3 times a week for 6 weeks -Children in the study were aged 8\u201318  years and were independent or modified independent ambulators (with/without assistive device use) \u2013With the combination of botulinum Toxintype-A  (BoNT-A)  and strength training, children with CP can get improvements in muscle size and muscle strength simultaneous with a reduction in spasticity(62) -Based on a study conducted in Australia -Fifteen children with spastic diplegic CP were randomized to 10 weeks of strength training either before or after receiving BoNT-A.  Children were assessed over 6 months -Significant strength improvements associated with hypertrophy were seen at 10 weeks and over 6 months -The study showed that muscles injected with BoNT-A  can be successfully strengthened \u2013Continuous passive motion (CPM) of the knees can reduce spastic hypertonia and improve ambulation in children with spastic CP(47) -Based on a research study conducted in Taiwan with 16 children (ages 6\u201312 years) with spastic CP (11 had spastic diplegia and 5 had spastic quadriplegia)(47) -Each participant completed an intervention session and a control session on separate days(47) -Researchers used a self-designed  CPM device to provide CPM to the participants\u2019 knee joints at a peak angular velocity of 15\u00b0 per second(47) -The session included 20 minutes of CPM of the knee joints during which time participants watched self-selected cartoons(47) -During the control session, a subject\u2019s knee was held stationary in 20\u201330\u00b0  flexion for 20 minutes(47) -Measurements of active and passive ROM of the knee and ankle joints, Pendulum test, MAS, two trials of TUG, and the 6MWT were completed before the intervention (time 1), immediately after the intervention (time 2), and 30 minutes after the intervention (time 3)(47) -Significant improvements in MAS, TUG, and 6MWT scores were found at time 2 and time 3after the intervention, but not after the control sessions; also, significant improvements of active ROM was seen after the intervention at time 2 and 3(47)",
            "Physical Fitness \u2013Investigators in the Netherlands found that lifestyle intervention is effective for improving cardiopulmonary fitness and body composition in adolescents and young adults with spastic CP(74) -Based on a single-blind  randomized controlled trial that involved 57 participants with spastic CP classified in GMFCS levels I through IV  -Forty-two  participants completed the study; of these, approximately half were diplegic -Participants were randomized to an active lifestyle and sports participation intervention group or to a control group that received no intervention to improve physical behavior and fitness -The active lifestyle and sports participation consisted of 3 parts: -Three months of weekly supervised center and weekly home-based physical training with a focus on increasing levels of cardiopulmonary fitness and muscle strength, supervised by a physical therapist -Counseling on daily physical activity (PA) based on motivational interviewing by a personal coach (physical therapist or movement therapist), aimed at increasing PA and minimizing sedentary behavior -Counseling on sports participation to find accessible and appropriate sports and sports facilities in each participant\u2019s environment -Outcome measures included peak oxygen consumption, body composition, and muscle strength -Measurements were performed4 times: before randomization, after the fitness training (3 months), after the entire intervention including counseling (6 months), and at the6 months follow-up  after the intervention -The results suggest that offering a lifestyle intervention has positive results on physical fitness -The intervention group had positive short-  and medium-term  effects on VO 2 peak oxygen consumption, and load on the anaerobic threshold, and waist circumference. Long-term  effects on the sum of skinfolds, systolic blood pressure, and total cholesterol were also obtained -The intervention was ineffective in increasing muscle strength. The authors concluded that the program needs to be optimized to increase muscle strength and also for long-term  retention of aerobic capacity improvements",
            "Seated positioning \u2013Bimanual-powered  wheelchair system may improve a child\u2019s seated postural alignment compared to a traditional unilateral-powered  device(66) -Based on a study conducted in Taiwan of 20 children with spastic CP (11 subjects with diplegia and 9 with quadriplegia) and a mean age of 7.7 years compared to children without any medical conditions -All children drove the powered wheelchair in both the unimanual and bimanual joystick modes,and researchers assessed postural alignment with the Seated Postural Control Measure -Children with CP demonstrated greater symmetrical alignment with the bimanual mode compared to the unilateral mode -The control group demonstrated greater postural alignment compared to the children with CP for both driving modes -The severity of CP moderately correlated with postural symmetry in both modes \u2013Seat surface inclination may affect the postural control and reach in preterm children with CP(48) -Based on a study conducted in the Netherlands of 58 children aged 2\u201311 years with spastic CP -Surface electromyographic and kinematic data were recorded while the children were sitting and reaching under 3 different conditions -Horizontal (no tilt) seat surface -Seat surface tilted forward 15\u00b0 -Seat surface tilted backward 15\u00b0 -Forward-tilted  seating position appeared better for postural control and reach in 34 children with unilateral spastic CP -Horizontal seating position appeared better for postural control and reach in 24 children with bilateral spastic CP",
            "Balance training \u2013In a small noncomparative study conducted in the United States of 6 children with CP (4 with spastic diplegia, 2 with spastic hemiplegia) who underwent 5 days of intensive balance training, consisting of 100 perturbations per day on a moveable force platform, the following findings were reported:(49) -In the children with spastic diplegia, the start of muscle contractions were late in the lower extremities once perturbations commenced; however, timing improved in certain muscles post training -Before training, the muscles contracted in a pattern of proximal to distal, which is the opposite of the pattern seen in typically developing children. However, after training this pattern reversed to the desired outcome of distal to proximal in 2 of the children but was not sustained at 1 month -An enhancement in the ability to control the amplitude of muscle activity was also observed in the patients with spastic diplegia, but this positive finding was seen in just 2 of the subjects at 1 month",
            "W/C management \u2013The following recommendations were made based on a year 2006 literature review on the effect of w/c positioning on upper extremity function in children with CP(50)  -The child\u2019s pelvis should be held in neutral position -A functional sitting position (FSO) is recommended for facilitating the use of the child\u2019s upper extremities -FSO \u2013 hip belt, abduction orthosis, a cutout tray, footrests, and orientation in the space of 0\u201315\u00b0 -A forward sloped seat of 0\u201315\u00b0 -The child\u2019s head, shoulders, and trunk should be positioned slightly anterior to the ischial tuberosities",
            "Treadmill training(51,52) \u2013Partial body weight supported treadmill training has recently been reported to be a safe and effective method for improving gait speed in children with cerebral palsy(51) -In a randomized controlled trial conducted in the United States comparing the effects of strengthening exercise and supported treadmill training, 26 children with cerebral palsy were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of intensive exercise based on impairments and functional tasks with an emphasis on standing weight-bearing  activities, or to 12 weeks of supported speed treadmill training -Gait speed, cadence and physical function as measured by the parent report for the Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument (PODCI) improved in both groups, with no significant difference between groups -Only the treadmill training group maintained the gains after the withdrawal of intervention(51) \u2013Recent advances in body weight support technology may improve the therapeutic protocols used for gait training in children with CP. Traditionally the body weight is supported with a chest corset that has straps under the groin or around the proximal thighs. These straps may be uncomfortable and limit the duration of and compliance with the training session(52) -Lower body positive pressure supported (LBPPS) treadmill training has been developed as an alternative means for supporting the body weight -A treadmill is enclosed in an inflatable (pressurized) bag. The child wears a pair of neoprene shorts that are zipped into the bag, and the amount of body weight supported is dependent upon the air pressure of the bag. Since the air pressure is uniformly distributed over the lower body it reduces the uncomfortable pressure points that often occur in traditional body weight support systems -Results of a feasibility study conducted in the United States with 9 participants indicate that LBPPS treadmill training is a feasible method to improve walking performance, balance, and strength of children with CP(52)",
            "Robotic training \u2013Investigators in the United States found that a rehabilitation protocol for patients with CP that used a robotic ankle device for ankle stretching and strengthening resulted in significant improvements(75) -Participants were 28 children with GMFCS levels I\u2013III.  There was no control group -All patients were seen twice per week for 75-minute  sessions for a total of 6 weeks. The intervention consisted of 30 minutes using the robotic ankle device for stretching and strengthening, followed by 45-minutes  of functional movement activities -Outcome measures included measures of plantarflexor and dorsiflexor ROM, strength, spasticity, mobility (using the TUG test, 6MWT, and 10MWT), balance (using the pediatric balance scale), selective control assessment of the lower extremity (SCALE), and the GMFM -Significant improvements were seen for all main outcome measures except the GMFM",
            "Video games \u2013Children with spastic diplegic CP can obtain exercise-related  benefits while playing with an active video game console (e.g., Wii games)(63) -Results of a study conducted in Canada that compared exercise intensity in children with spastic diplegia and children who were typically developing showed no difference between the groups while they played 4 active video games (jogging, bicycling, snowboarding, and skiing)(63) -Ten children with spastic diplegic CP and 10 age-matched  children who were typically developing were evaluated playing 4 video games for 40 minutes. HR was recorded for the entire time using a HR belt monitor -The amount of time spent at an intensity greater than 40% of heart rate reserve (HRR) was recorded -Active video game consoles appear to be an affordable, safe, and fun way to improve aerobic capacity in children with CP",
            "Neurodevelopmental treatment (NDT) \u2013NDT may not be more effective than other therapeutic strategies in the rehabilitative treatment of individuals with CP(53)  -Based on the report by the American Academy for Cerebral Palsy and Developmental Medicine -A more intense NDT program may not yield better outcomes than standard frequency of treatment -Task-oriented  approaches, strengthening, endurance training, and the use of assistive technologies may yield better results, but more research is needed to support this \u2013NDT 5 times per week might be more effective than 2 times per week for improving function in children with CP(54) -Based on a small randomized trial conducted in Greece -Thirty-four  children were randomized to NDT twice a week for 16 weeks vs. NDT 5 times a week for 16 weeks -Sessions were 50 minutes long in each group -Both treatment groups had significant improvements in gross motor function after the 16-week  treatment regimen according to the GMFM-88 -The group that underwent intensive (5 days per week) therapy had a greater improvement in function",
            "Orthotics \u2013Wearing hinged AFOs during sit-to-stand  (STS) transfers was reported to improve the transfer in a study conducted in South Korea(21) -Nineteen children with spastic diplegic CP completed STS transfers with hinged AFOs and without (barefoot) -Subjects were aged 2\u20136 years -While wearing the AFO -Duration of transfer was significantly reduced -Initial dorsiflexion and knee flexion angle were significantly increased -Dorsiflexion end range was significantly increased -The maximum power of hip extension and knee extension was significantly increased -Hip and pelvis movements did not differ significantly from barefoot trials -Plantarflexion power did not differ significantly .
