            "The biceps muscle has two separate proximal tendons, a short head and a long head. The short head of the biceps tendon attaches to the coracoid process. The long head attaches to the supraglenoid tubercle, located on the superior glenoid labrum. The long head is almost always affected in biceps tendinopathy(1)",
            "The long head of the biceps tendon traverses the bicipital groove and attaches to the superior labrum.(1) The long head traverses through the rotator interval between the subscapularis and supraspinatus. Within this area, the coracohumeral ligament and the superior glenohumeral ligament compose a \u201ctendoligamentous sling\u201d that provides stability for the long head(1)",
            "The long head of the biceps contributes 10% of shoulder abduction when the humerus is externally rotated.(1) It has also been reported to act as a glenohumeral stabilizer and a humeral head depressor(3)",
            "Because the long head is also an intraarticular shoulder structure, its pathology is often associated with degenerative processes of the rotator cuff and the glenohumeral joint (e.g., subscapularis tendon rupture, superior labral anterior to posterior [SLAP] lesions, shoulder impingement).(1,6)Consequently, the etiology of biceps tendinopathy and the resultant chronic pain are likely multifactorial(16)",

            "Long head of biceps tendinopathy (LHBT) \u2013LHBT is an umbrella term that encompasses tendinosis/tendonitis/paratenonitis/tendon rupture(2) \u2013Chronic overuse tendon injury should be considered tendinopathy, not tendonitis(15) \u2013Tendinopathy is a clinical syndrome describing repetitive overuse tendon injury characterized by pain, swelling, and/or functional limitation \u2013Tendinopathy could be tendonitis (presence of inflammation) or tendinosis (absence of inflammation; degeneration of the tendon). Inflammation is likely important in the early phase and gradually declines as degenerative changes develop(4,15) -There continue to be differing opinions on whether tendinosis refers to a tendon that is irreversibly damaged or just in a failed healing stage(15) \u2013Inflammation is less often a part of the pathology in clinical cases of LHBT; therefore, such treatments as anti-inflammatory  medication might have no benefit(6)",
            "Biceps tendonitis/tenosynovitis(1,4) \u2013Tendon inflammation is commonly referred to as biceps tendonitis when it is more likely tenosynovitis  \u2013Inflammation of the tendon sheath can impact the long head. In chronic cases, the tendon becomes enlarged and pain increases \u2013Primary (or isolated) biceps tendonitis refers to inflammation of the tendon as it runs in the intertubercular groove. It typically occurs in the younger athletic population and in only 5% of cases with LHBT",
            "Biceps tendinosis(4) \u2013The term biceps tendinosis is accurately used when there are degenerative changes in the tendon \u2013LHBT presents more commonly as tendinosis rather than tendonitis \u2013Degeneration of the tendon occurs \u2013It is often a consequence of chronic overuse \u2013Biceps tendinosis is typically seen in older patients (athletes older than 35 and nonathletes older than 65)",
            "Biceps tendon rupture(2) \u2013Long head tendon rupture typically occurs secondary to degeneration or partial tearing \u2013Although not always present after a rupture, a \u201cPopeye\u201d muscle sign might be visible if the long head retracts, resulting in a bulging biceps muscle belly(1)"

            "Guidelines for conservative treatment of LHBT are lacking.(15)In most cases, a comprehensive shoulder rehabilitation program should include strengthening exercises for(16) \u2013rotator cuff/scapular stabilizers \u2013shoulder joint stability and function \u2013upper-body  posture \u2013elbow flexion",
            "The treatment plan should also involve patient education on faulty techniques and sports training errors, as well as discussion of acceptable relative rest and activity modification. Proper posture and body mechanics should also be reviewed, and workstation modifications should be implemented as appropriate(4)",
            "Although an evidence-based  protocol for biceps tendinopathy is currently lacking, current physical therapy typically focuses on the following:(4) \u2013Achieving full, pain-free  ROM \u2013Developing adequate scapular and core stability \u2013Improving any scapulothoracic strength and rhythm deficits \u2013Restoring rotator cuff and biceps strength \u2013Posterior capsule stretching",
            "The benefit of NSAIDs and corticosteroid injections to treat pain in patients with LHBT is questionable(4,16)",
            "Following operative intervention for LHBT, strictly adhere to the surgeon\u2019s prescription or protocol. Postoperative therapy might include the following:(11) \u2013Sling use for the first 4 weeks after surgery with only passive elbow and shoulder ROM allowed \u2013Sling use discontinued after the 4 weeks and active ROM is then initiated \u2013Strengthening exercises to begin at 10 weeks postoperatively  -Authors of a case-control  prospective study (N = 48 patients with chronic LHBT) conducted at multiple international sites found that a single session of radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy (rESWT; 2000 shock waves, energy flux density of 0.18 mJ/mm) significantly improved V AS, QuickDash, and RM scores during a 12-month  follow-up compared to controls(18)",
            "Authors of a case-series  observational study (N = 10 patients with chronic LHBT) in the United States found that 2 to 8 sessions of dry needling to the LHBT, plus strengthening and stretching of the biceps muscle, improved global rating of change (GROC), QuickDASH, and pain scores (V AS)(19)",

Problem Goal Intervention Expected Progression Home Program Pain Decrease pain Patient education _ Instruct patient to modify or discontinue activities that provoke pain, such as restricting the range of daily upper-extremity activities to below shoulder height _ _ Physical agents and mechanical modalities _ Use of cryotherapy for pain relief.(9) The efficacy of ultrasound therapy is still uncertain(12)Reduced reliance on modalities over timeRest to allow decrease of irritation of LHBT. Educate patient on modifying activities that involve aggravating movements, such as overhead activity. Instruct patient in use of cold packs, proper posture, and correct body mechanics  Reduced ROM Improve ROM Physical agents and mechanical modalities _ The use of hot packs prior to treatment might assist in attaining further ROM gains(9) _ _ Therapeutic exercises _ Once pain has subsided, ROM and gentle stretching exercises might be prescribed (e.g., wall walking, pulleys, towel stretches). Avoidance of abduction and aggressive overhead exercises might be necessary early on _ _ Manual therapy _ Resolve restricted scapular, thoracic spine, and/or shoulder joint arthrokinematics with appropriate joint mobilization techniquesTherapeutic exercises _ Progress abduction and overhead exercises as appropriateHome exercise program of ROM and stretching exercises  Shoulder/scapular and biceps muscle weakness or atrophyIncrease strength of weak musclesTherapeutic exercises _ Strengthening should focus on the scapular stabilizers and the rotator cuff. Begin with isometric strengthening of the middle/lower scapular retractors along with internal and external rotator cuff strengthening exercises, as indicated _ _ Manual therapy _ Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) for improving scapulohumeral rhythm (e.g., therapist manually resists scapular elevation, depression, protraction, and retraction)Therapeutic exercises _ Progress to dynamic scapular stabilizing exercises, anterosuperior rotator cuff strengthening (e.g., scaption or forward flexion with weight) and biceps strengthening (e.g., isometrics, bicep curls, or resisted supination as appropriate)Provide a home exercise program that incorporates strengthening of the scapular stabilizers, rotator cuff, and biceps Poor posture and weak core/trunk strengthCorrect faulty posture and improve core/trunk strengthPatient education _ Educate patient on proper posture concepts along with posture monitoring techniques _ _ Therapeutic exercises _ Pectoral stretching, deep cervical flexor strengthening, and foam roller exercises. Also incorporate transversus abdominis strengtheningTherapeutic exercises _ Progress to dynamic closed-chain stabilization and ball stabilization exercisesIncorporate postural correction and core/ trunk strengthening exercises in the home exercise program Restrictions in ADLs or sportRestore prior functional capacity in ADLs or sportTherapeutic exercises _ When appropriate, introduce dynamic, multidirectional exercises that begin to resemble activities similar to typical environment(4)Functional training _ Slowly reintegrate back to sport specific training(4)Gradual return to sport/activity as appropriate(4)  ."
