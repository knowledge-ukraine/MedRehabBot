            "Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is a long-term  complication that develops in approximately 15% to 25% of patients withtype 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) (1,2,3,41)",
            "DFUs occur most often on the plantar surface of the forefoot(hallux, first metatarsal head) and heel, but alsoin the nail folds and nail beds (1,2,3)",
            "Uninfected DFUs are characterized by ischemia, swelling, callus, deformity, and loss of sensation due to neuropathy (1,3)",
            "Uninfected DFUs represent the pivotal first and second stages (Wagner grades 1 and 2) in the natural history of diabetic foot disease(1,2,3) \u2013Wagner Grading System -0: Intact skin -1: Superficial ulcer of skin or subcutaneous tissue -2: Ulceration extends through dermis; may extend into tendon and bone capsule -3: Deep ulcer with osteomyelitis or abscess -4: Gangrene of affected toes or distal half of foot -5: Proximal foot gangrene",
            "Prompt treatment and surveillance of DFU is imperative because in the United States it is estimated that only 50% of ulcers close within one year (2)",

            "This Clinical Review focuses on the identification and treatment of Wagner grade 1 or 2 DFUs. Patients with chronic infected DFUs (for example, abscess, osteomyelitis, or gangrene) often require surgical management to accomplish limb salvage and prevent amputation"

(GRADE strength of recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: low) \u2013In general, remove slough, necrotic tissue, and surrounding callus with sharp debridement in preference to other methods, taking relative contraindications such as severe ischemia into account. (strong; low) \u2013Select dressings principally on the basis of exudate control, comfort, and cost. (strong; low) \u2013Do not use antimicrobial dressings with the goal of improving wound healing or preventing secondary infection. (strong; moderate) \u2013Consider the use of systemic hyperbaric oxygen therapy, even though further blinded and randomized trials are required to confirm its cost-effectiveness,  as well as to identify the population most likely to benefit from its use. (weak; moderate) \u2013Topical negative pressure wound therapy may be considered in postoperative wounds even though the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness  of the approach remain to be established. (weak; moderate) \u2013Do not select agents reported to improve wound healing by altering the biology of the wound, including growth factors, bioengineered skin products and gases, in preference to accepted standards of good quality care. (strong; low) \u2013Do not select agents reported to have an impact on wound healing through alteration of the physical environment, including through the use of electricity, magnetism, ultrasound, and shockwaves, in preference to accepted standards of good quality care. (strong; low) \u2013Do not select systemic treatments reported to improve wound healing, including drugs and herbal therapies, in preference to accepted standards of good quality care. (strong; low)",
            "Standard foot care : In the office setting, this includes gentle irrigation twice daily with normal saline or a surfactant cleanser to remove contamination and for mechanical debridement, followed by dressing(16) \u2013Dead tissue and debris should be debrided from the ulcer to obtain a pink and granulating wound base \u2013Superficial debridement can be accomplished by water spray using a sterile 18-gneedle and 30-ml  syringe or a commercial sprayer.(17) However, hyperkeratotic and necrotic tissue usually require surgical trimming  \u2013Evidence is lacking to support the use of alginate dressings, hydrocolloid dressings, or foam dressings for increasing the healing rate of DFUs compared with basic wound contact dressings -Based on 3 separate Cochrane reviews that compared alginate dressings with standard contact dressings (6 trials, 375 participants),(18) hydrocolloid dressings with standard contact dressings (4 trials, 511 participants),(19) and foam dressings with standard contact dressings (6 trials, 157 participants)(34) \u2013Traditional low-adherent  dressings that retain moisture can be used if the DFU is not infected, but are contraindicated in the presence of infection(20) \u2013Change dressings at least daily \u2013Treat infected wounds with the prescribed antibiotic \u2013Patient education should include infection control and offloading of the area around DFU \u2013Remind patients to avoid warm foot baths and heating pads (because of risk for skin burning) and to avoid using harsh topical agents such as hydrogen peroxide, iodine (e.g., Betadine), and astringents (e.g., witch hazel)",
            "Orthopedic devices : Offloading-pressure  devices may prevent DFU, improve healing, and reduce recurrence(2,21,22,34) \u2013Assistive devices to relieve WB (e.g., crutches, walkers, custom relief orthotic walkers [CROWs], or wheelchair) \u2013Special shoes/inserts \u2013 custom shoes, depth shoes, diabetic boots, forefoot and heel relief shoes, and custom inserts \u2013Total contact cast (TCC) \u2013Authors of a 2013 Cochrane systematic review of 7 trials (366 participants) found that non-removable,  pressure-relieving casts were more effective for healing plantar DFUs than removable casts or dressings alone(22) \u2013In a 2-year  follow-up  study in Spain, customized orthotics (N = 200 feet) that significantly reduced mean peak plantar pressure (to well below 200 kPa) decreased the re-ulceration  rate from 79% to 15% (44) \u2013Authors of a 2016 systematic review found good-quality  evidence supporting the use of non-removable  offloading support interventions in order to provide pressure relief to prevent forefoot ulcer recurrences(50) \u2013In patients treated with a TCC there was a higher proportion of healed wounds and faster healing time compared to those who were treated with healing sandals or a shear-reducing  foot bed(51) -Based on a 12-week  single-blind  RCT in the United States -Seventy-three  patients with DFU were randomized into three groups: TCC, healing sandals, or removable boot with shear-reducing  foot bed -Results show that patients treated with the TCC had a higher proportion of wounds healed (69.6%) compared to patients treated with healing sandals (44.5%) or removable boot with shear-reducing  foot bed (22.2%)",

Authors of a 2013 systematic review of 8 RCTs (N = 325 participants) found that evidence is lacking to support the general use of electrophysical modalities for managing DFUs(35) \u2013Low level laser therapy (LLLT): results of an RCT (N = 68) in India showed that LLLT increased the percentage of ulcer area reduction over 15 days compared to controls who received conventional treatment for DFU(27) -On the basis of the ulcer size, the duration of exposure to LLLT was calculated to deliver 2\u20134 J/cm2  at 60 mW, 5 kHz, daily for 15 days \u2013Foot humidifier: A device that delivered warm, humidified air with a noncontact dressing (3 hours daily, 5 days per week, 8 weeks) improved ulcer healing time versus standard care in a case series in the United States(23) \u2013Electrical stimulation (ES):Several different applications of ES have been described to promote wound healing, including direct current, alternating current, high-voltage  pulsed current, low-intensity  direct current, and pulsatile electrostatic current. Evidence is lacking to support any one approach because of the variability in the parameters of ES application usedin reported studies -Low-intensity  direct current -Authors of a study conducted in Iran found that low intensity cathodal direct current electrical stimulation at sensory threshold effectively increased the plasma level of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and nitric oxide (NO) in patients with diabetic foot ulcers. VEGF and NO were associated with improved blood flow and tissue temperature, thereby promoting healing(46)  -Pulsatile electrostatic field (PESF)(52) -Authors of a study conducted in Italy suggested that use of PESF can accelerate ulcer wound healing in patients with type 2 diabetes. PESF is noninvasive and works by reducing the formation of rouleaux, increasing metabolic activity, and increasing vasomotor function \u2013Ultrasound therapy: -Authors of a pilot study in the United States found that more frequent use of non-contact  low-frequency  ultrasound (NCLF-US)  was effective for treating DFUs by inhibiting pro-inflammatory  cytokines(47) -Profiles of cytokines/proteinase/growth factors in wound fluid and biopsied tissue were quantified in 12 subjects with chronic DFUs -Subjects were randomized to receive standard care, NCLF-US  once per week, or NCLF-US  3 times per week. Thrice weekly application resulted in the best wound area reduction \u2013Air massage: Authors of a study in South Africa found that the experimental group that received compressed air massage to tissue around the ulcer (15 to 20 minutes, 5 days per week) reduced the time to healing by 25 days (30.1%) compared to standard-care-only  group(24) \u2013Authors of a 2010 systematic review concluded that negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT), a vacuum technique to facilitate drainage, is safe and can accelerate DFU healing.(25)However, authors of a 2013 Cochrane review of 5 RCTs (N = 605 participants) found that the current evidence was insufficient or uncertain to support the use of NPWT for treating DFUs(36)",
            "Therapeutic exercise : \u2013Individualized moderate exercise training (ET) is safe and effective for blood glucose control in most patients with type 2 DM.(33) However, patients with DFUs should receive physician clearance before starting a new exercise program -Physician clearance for ET is mandatory if exercise-related  adverse signs/symptoms are documented in the patient\u2019s medical history -Exercise without physician supervision is contraindicated if patient has known heart disease -Adapt therapeutic exercises for ambulatory patients with functional limitations (e.g., poor balance, restricted WB status, poor coordination) to reduce risk of falls \u2013Recommendations for footcare in the American Diabetes Association\u2019s Standards of Medical Care include consideration of exercise for patients with significant claudication or a positive ankle-brachial  index (indicative of LE arterial disease)(40) \u2013Authors of an RCT (N = 29 participants with DM and peripheral neuropathy whose walking ability was not limited by diabetic foot disease) in the United States found that standing and walking (WB) exercises (progressive balance, flexibility, strengthening, and aerobic training) 3 times per week for 12 weeks increased 6MWT scores and daily step count significantly more than the same exercises done in sitting or lying (non-WB)(37) .
