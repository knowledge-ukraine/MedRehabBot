            "A potential advantage of kettlebell swing training is that joint actions can simulate daily activities. For example, kettlebell swings utilizing the hip-hinge  technique may elicit lower-limb muscle activation patterns similar to running(6)"

            "Authors of a cohort study in the United States tested the strengthening benefit of a kettlebell training program using the barbell bench press, back extension test, and clean-and-jerk  test. Thirty-seven  subjectswere randomized to an experimental group (n=23, mean age 40.9 years) or a control group (n=14, 39.6 years).After 10 weeks (2 days/week) of kettlebell training, the experimental group showed significantly (P<0.05) improved strength in the barbell bench press. In contrast,their mean strength in the back extension and clean-and-jerk  tests failed to reach statistical significance.(1) This is an example of how the benefit of kettlebell swing-training  (i.e., a specific mode of strength training)has not been shown in commonly used strength tests",

For example, authors of a cross-sectional EMG study (n=10 volunteers) in the United States compared the muscle activation patterns in the rotator cuff and scapular musculature during five commonlyutilized kettlebell exercises. Significant (P < 0.05) EMG differences between the exercises were observed for all target muscles except the infraspinatus(3)",
            "Authors of a cross-sectional  cohort study (n=19 recreationallyactive men) in Taiwan measured the EMG responses of the quadriceps, hamstrings, tibialis anterior, and gastrocnemius lateralis and medialis during loaded and unloaded squat and  lunge exercises. In the squat, significantly (P<0.05) less EMG activation was found in the semitendinosus and tibialis anterior for loading with kettlebells compared to loading with a barbell, dumbbell, or vest of the same weight(4)",
