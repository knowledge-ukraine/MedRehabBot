A multiple-baseline  study examined the effects of systematic practice with words exemplifying specific GPC rules (e.g., \u201cc\u201d before \u201ca,\u201d \u201co,\u201d and \u201cu\u201d is pronounced /k/) on single-word  reading ability in a patient with phonological dyslexia. Two rules were trained over a 6-week  period (11 total sessions). The patient had significantly improved reading of target words as well as untreated stimuli(21) \u2013Other studies examining the effects of rule-based  training have found that patients are able to learn GPC rules but are often unable to blend phonemes together to read words.(31) Effects of this approach are mixed(31) \u2013Clinicians utilized a two-phase  treatment approach to strengthen both reading and spelling in a study conducted in the United States with 2 subjects with phonological alexia and agraphia(32) -The first phase of treatment focused on strengthening the sublexical/phonological route by retraining the relationships between phonemes and graphemes for 20 consonants and 12 vowels(32) -The second phase (termed interactive treatment) trained the subjects to utilize their newly relearned phonological knowledge to generate plausible spellings and detect/correct spelling errors(32) -Following 26 hour-long  sessions of therapy for each participant (3 times per week), both participants showed improvement in reading and spelling skills; additionally, they reported satisfaction with the treatment program(32)",
            "Semantically based approaches \u2013Homophone association:  Authors of a case study examined the differential effects of two techniques to instruct functor words (e.g., of, be, the) on persons with phonological dyslexia. One of the techniques involved training two patients to associate nonpicturable words (e.g., functor words) with homophonous nouns (e.g., \u201cbe\u201d paired with \u201cbee\u201d). The other technique involved training the patients to repeat target words and read them in a sentence (stimulation approach).(33) Results indicated that both patients succeeded in reading the target words with 90% accuracy with the homophone association method but only 59% with the repetition method(33) \u2013Association of phonologically related words: In a multiple-baseline  study conducted in the United States, researchers examined the effects of training a patient with phonological alexia to associate functor and nonpicturable words with phonologically similar words (e.g., \u201cformer\u201d with \u201cfour mermaids\u201d). A control condition involved repetition of another set of functor words. Treatment for 60 targets was provided in 69 sessions over a period of 17 months (90-minute sessions). The patient improved to criterion level performance (90% accuracy) with the homophone training but not with the repetition training (44% accuracy). Fewer errors were made when the target more closely resembled the paired association(31)",
            "Instruction for increasing reading fluency and comprehension \u2013Multiple oral reading (MOR):  MOR involves repeated guided reading practice of the same material over a period of days or weeks -Authors of a case study of a patient with phonological dyslexia examined the effects of MOR at home(2)  -The patient practiced reading aloud an article from the newspaper for 30 minutes each day for 1 week. The following week a new article was selected. The study continued for 18 weeks(2) -The patient improved reading fluency for the articles read. He also reported that he was able to achieve a faster reading rate much sooner for later articles. His understanding of new articles also improved(2) -In a study of MOR conducted in the United States involving 6 patients with acquired dyslexia (4 with phonological dyslexia and 2 with pure dyslexia), treatment consisted of one 2-hour  session per week for 8 weeks(34) -Each week, a different passage was trained in the session; untrained control, functor, and content passages were never trained but were tested pre and post therapy(34) -With the patients with pure dyslexia, reading rate for novel passages containing significant numbers of trained words increased as measured by post-therapy  tests(34) -Researchers concluded that MOR improves reading of untrained passages that overlap trained passages at the level of the patient\u2019s specific deficit(34) \u2013Repetition priming:  Repetition priming involves repetitive reading of words within sentences. Authors of a case study examined the effects of a program requiring a patient to read sentences by building them in steps. A patient with phonological dyslexia was instructed to read only the words that were highlighted in sentences in a computer program. The program gradually highlighted more words so that the patient \u201cbuilt\u201d sentences gradually. This strategy of building sentences gradually and repeating words multiple times improved the patient\u2019s reading with trained and untrained sentences(35) \u2013Pseudoword training:  In a study conducted in the United States with 5 patients with acquired phonological dyslexia, researchers examined the effectiveness of pseudoword training on reading ability.(37) Researchers created lists of training words with different initial consonant clusters ranked as either \u201csimple\u201d or \u201ccomplex\u201d as indicated by sonority difference. Specific training and probe lists for each participant differed according to his or her individual strengths and weaknesses as measured during baseline assessments. For each initial consonant cluster, a list containing 20 real words and 20 pseudowords was randomly divided into either the trained or untrained group for each participant. Those participants who were initially trained on the simple cluster lists were trained on the complex cluster lists during the second training phase and vice versa. During the intervention phase of the study, treatment focused on training 3 different skills: 1) phoneme segmentation; 2) matching graphemes and phonemes; and 3) phoneme blending. At the conclusion of the study, outcome measures indicated that all participants improved on the trained clusters. Two of the participants who were trained on complex clusters first generalized to untrained simple clusters; however, the participants who were trained on simple clusters first did not show the same pattern. Researchers suggested that complex therapeutic targets should be used in treatment for patients with acquired phonological dyslexia in order to increase the likelihood of generalization to untrained items(37) . Problem Goal Intervention Expected Progression Home Program  Phonological dyslexia Increase understanding of rule-based spelling to assist in word readingGPC rules _ Provide systematic instruction of GPC rules. Patients practice specific rules to assist them in decoding unfamiliar words (e.g., \u201cc\u201d before \u201ca,\u201d \u201co,\u201d and \u201cu\u201d is pronounced / k/). Effects of this approach are mixed due to difficulties in blending phonemes(31) _ _ See Treatment summary , aboveProgression of tasks in reading therapy generally increases gradually, per discretion of the SLP and tolerance of the patient, from word level to phrase level, sentence level, and finally paragraph levelGrapheme-to-phoneme conversion rules can be practiced at home  Phonological dyslexia Increase reading of functor wordsHomophone/similar word association _ Provide instruction of functor words (e.g., of, be, the) or verbs by pairing them with homophonous nouns or phonologically similar words that are more easily read due to their semantic strength and ability to be visualized (e.g., \u201cbe\u201d paired with \u201cbee\u201d; \u201cmuch\u201d paired with \u201cmud\u201d).(33) An example activity might include providing the patient with index cards that contain the target word on one side (e.g., \u201cbe\u201d) and the homophone or phonologically similar word on the other (e.g., \u201cbee\u201d). The patient can associate the two words by first saying the noun and then the target word. Two case studies provide preliminary positive evidence for this approach(31,33) _ _ See Treatment summary , aboveProgression of tasks in reading therapy generally increases gradually, per discretion of the SLP and tolerance of the patient, from word level to phrase level, sentence level, and finally paragraph levelPractice with homophone association can be performed at home  Phonological dyslexia Increase reading fluency and reading comprehension by practicing repeated readings of words, sentences, phrases, or text (newspaper articles)Multiple oral reading (MOR) _ MOR involves repeated reading practice of the same material over a period of days or weeks.

Reading practice can be performed at home for up to 30 minutes at a time(2) _ _ Repetition priming _ Repetition priming involves repetitive reading of words within sentences.
