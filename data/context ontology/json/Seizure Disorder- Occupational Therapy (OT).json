Types of focal seizures include aura, motor, autonomic, and dyscognitive(6) -The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) distinguishes between the following types of focal seizures:(8) -Motor vs non-motor  onset -Aware vs impaired awareness \u2013 awareness of self and environment during seizure -Focal to bilateral tonic-clonic  \u2013 progression from focal to generalized \u2013Generalized seizures (also called tonic/clonic seizures) are abnormal electrical activity over both hemispheres of the brain.(8)There is usually loss of consciousness. These were formerly known as grand mal seizures -Types of generalized seizures include convulsive, absence (formerly known as petit mal), tonic, atonic, and myoclonic(6) -ILAE distinguishes between the following types of generalized seizures:(8) -Non-motor  (or absence) seizures \u2013 impairment in consciousness -Motor \u2013 tonic-clonic,  tonic, clonic, myoclonic, myoclonic-tonic-clonic, myotonic-atonic,  atonic, and epileptic spasms -If there is no recovery of consciousness between 2 seizures, this is called status epilepticus; if there is recovery of consciousness between, this is referred to as serial seizures \u2013Seizures can also be considered combined generalized and focal if EEG shows signs of both(8)",
