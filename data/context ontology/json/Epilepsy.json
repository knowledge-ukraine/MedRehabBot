            "During a seizure, abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal discharge occurs in the cerebral cortex of the brain. This results in a sudden, transient change in behavior.(1) The diagnosis of epilepsy requires the occurrence of at least one epileptic seizure, but, in practice, epilepsy is most commonly diagnosed after two or more unprovoked seizures.(1)Epilepsy refers to a clinical phenomenon rather than a single disease entity because there are many forms and causes of epilepsy(2)",
            "The International League against Epilepsy (ILAE) has finalized an operational definition that is suitable for clinical use(7) \u2013Epilepsy is present when any of the following conditions is met: -At least two unprovoked (or reflex) seizures occurring more than 24 hours apart -One unprovoked (or reflex) seizure and a probability of further seizures similar to the general recurrence risk (at least 60%) after two unprovoked seizures, occurring over the next 10 years; or -Diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome \u2013Epilepsy is considered to be resolved for individuals who either had an age-dependent epilepsy syndrome but are now past the applicable age or those who have remained seizure-free  for the last 10 years and off anti-seizure  medicines for at least the last 5 years",
            "Provoked nonreflex (or acute symptomatic) seizures are seizures provoked by factors that temporarily reduce the seizure threshold (e.g., within 7 days of stroke or head trauma or in conjunction with a metabolic derangement)(8)",
            "Epilepsy is considered a common disease, affecting about 50 million persons worldwide; lifetime risk of developing epilepsy is estimated at 3% to age 80 years. The incidence of epilepsy is about 55 per 100,000 population in the United States and Europe, with the highest incidence in infants younger than 1 year and in adults older than 60 years of age(1)"
