            "During embryonic development, the neural groove gradually deepens as the neural folds become elevated. The folds ultimately meet and coalesce in the midline, converting the neural groove into a closed tube known as the neural tube or neural canal. The neural tube is the embryo\u2019s precursor to the developing central nervous system (CNS), including the brain and spinal cord. In SB, there is incomplete closure of the vertebral arches surrounding the neural tube, exposing the developing spinal cord and nerves(42)",
            "SB is a type of neural tube defect (NTD), also known as spinal dysraphism. NTDs are a group of serious birth defects that affect the developing nervous system and include SB, anencephaly, and encephalocele(6)",
            "SB literally means \u201cspine split into two\u201d and is technically correct in describing any patient with an incomplete closure of the spinal column. The term SB is sometimes used nonspecifically in the literature with regard to all patients with NTDs. Epidemiologic studies of spinal dysraphism typically include both myelomeningocele (MMC) and meningocele (MC) collectively as SB. There is such a large degree of variation of anatomic malformations associated with such a condition and, therefore, more specific terminology is used(6)",
            "In the United States, the incidence of SB is 3.4 per 10,000 live births(42)"

            "SBMMC \u2013Most severe type of SB; when individuals refer to SB they are usually speaking about this type(2) \u2013Spinal defect is present in conjunction with a cyst, comprised of meninges and cerebrospinal fluid, which protrudes through the defect in the posterior elements of the spine with involvement of the spinal cord or nerve roots(24) \u2013Risk of serious infections at birth due to nervous tissue exposure(3) \u2013Nerve damage is present(2) \u2013Severe disabilities including paralysis, incontinence, and seizures(3) \u2013Neurological impact above the site of the lesion is attributed to Arnold Chiari malformation and hydrocephalus. Impairments may be motor, cognitive, and perceptual in nature(4) \u2013A subgroup of MMC is known as hemimeningomyelocele(6) -Rare condition in which MMC and a split cord malformation (SCM) are seen -SCM \u2013 a \u201cspinal cord duplication\u201d -SCM type I \u2013 \u201cTwo hemicords, each contained within its own dural sheath, separated by a rigid osseocartilaginous median septum\u201d -SCM type II \u2013 \u201cTwo hemicords are housed in a single dural sheath with a nonrigid fibrous median septum\u201d -Just one hemicord is present in the MMC -Estimated 2\u20133%  of patients with SB have this type  -One lower extremity\u2019s function is intact while the other extremity is significantly compromised -Typically the patient is continent in the bladder -Severe scoliosis is present at birth leading to lateral trunk deviation, pelvic obliquity, elevated pelvis, and significant leg length discrepancy -In split cord malformations tethering of the spinal cord can occur and will be indicated by an increase in symptoms \u2013It is highly recommended that if MMC is identified, surgical management be performed in the perinatal period in order to prevent lethal complications from MMC(48)",
            "The terms SB aperta and SB cystica can also be used to refer to both SB MC and SB MMC(24) \u2013SB cystica refers to a sac filled with cerebrospinal fluid protruding from the spinal column(24) \u2013SB aperta refers to a midline defect that communicates with the external environment(24)",
            "Signs/symptoms of complications associated with SB vary greatly depending on the classification, level of the spinal defect, and severity of the condition \u2013Intellectual and cognitive disability(42) \u2013Hydrocephalus(24) -Approximately 15% of those with MMC are born with severe hydrocephalus and require immediate shunting -Presence of hydrocephalus correlates strongly with the level of the spinal defect. Thoracic lesions have a higher incidence than lumbar or cervical -Ventricular enlargement can occur prior to measurable change in head circumference -Delayed-onset  hydrocephalus can present with signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (vomiting, headaches, irritability, somnolence) \u2013Seizures(24) \u2013Chiari malformation (also known as Arnold-Chiari malformation)(24) -Chiari II malformation is characterized by variable displacement of cerebellar tissue into the spinal canal, accompanied by caudal dislocation of the lower brainstem and fourth ventricle -Signs and symptoms -Intermittent obstructive or central apnea -Cyanosis -Bradycardia -Dysphagia -Nystagmus -Stridor -V ocal cord paralysis -Torticollis -Opisthotonos -Hypotonia -Upper extremity weakness -Spasticity -The combination of stridor, central apnea, and aspiration is also referred to as central ventilator dysfunction -Symptomatic Chiari II malformation is the leading cause of death for infants with MMC and operative mortality is relatively high (34% to 38%)(24) \u2013Other congenital anomalies associated with SB: congenital tumors, dermal sinus tract, neuroenteric cysts, diastematomyelia(46) -Hydromyelia: is the dilation of the center canal of the spinal cord and analogous to dilation of the ventricles in the brain(24) -It is very common in children with MMC. It is probably more common than reported because it is often asymptomatic. Symptoms may include: -increase in degree of scoliosis -spasticity -decreased strength or coordination of the upper or lower extremities  \u2013Tethered cord syndrome -Spinal cord can be fixed or \u201ctethered\u201d at one point, causing traction injury to the spinal cord. This can lead to progressive loss of urologic, neurologic, and musculoskeletal function. Tethered cord can develop as a result of adhesions and fibrosis between the intraspinal neural structures, the meninges, and the surrounding vertebral structures following MMC repair. Tethered cord often occurs at lower lumbar or sacral levels. Typical signs and symptoms are(24) -increased weakness -pain -worsening gait -scoliosis -new or worsening of musculoskeletal impairments -urologic dysfunction/sphincter disturbances -trophic ulcers \u2013Neurogenic bladder, often associated with recurrent urinary tract infections due to incomplete emptying of the bladder(24) -Urologic impairment is not correlated with the level of the lesion as in a traumatic spinal cord injury -More than 90% of infants with MMC will have a neurogenic bladder (partial or complete denervation of the bladder), associated with poor compliance and contractibility resulting in abnormal residual urine volume -Urethral sphincter is incompetent in 86% of individuals resulting in incontinence -Approximately one-third  of individuals with SB have detrusor-sphincter  dyssynergia, resulting in high intraluminal pressures -The external sphincter is typically partially functional -Aggressive urinary management during infancy can make a significant impact on the child\u2019s renal health and the ability to develop urinary continence -Hydronephrosis is found in 7% to 30% of infants and reflux occurs in ~20% of infants(24) \u2013Neurogenic bowel -Incontinence due to impaired rectal sensation, decreased internal anal sphincter tone (for those with lesion of L3 or greater), sphincter dysfunction, and altered colonic motility(24) -The presence of cutaneous or bulbocavernosus reflex has been associated with a greater likelihood of achieving bowel continence(24) -Severe chronic constipation(46) \u2013Musculoskeletal complications(24) -Only one-third  of individuals present with flaccid paralysis below the level of the lesion. Most have a combination of upper and lower motor neuron signs(24) -Many present with asymmetric motor and sensory impairments(24) -Decreased bone mineral density with potential for pathological fractures(17) -The hip joint is most often affected due to muscle imbalances at the hip accounting for most of the hip flexion deformity in addition to hip flexor spasticity and prolonged sitting in a wheelchair(24) -Hip subluxation develops due to muscle imbalances -Hip dislocation can occur congenitally or be acquired -Joint contractures at the hips, knees, or ankles(24) -Foot deformities are the most common and present in almost all children with SB -Foot deformities can be present from birth due to lack of intrauterine movement or muscle imbalance. They may also develop over time due to muscle imbalances and weight bearing forces -The most common foot deformities in children with SB are equinus, equinovarus, calcaneus cavus, and rocker bottom deformity(24) -Spinal deformities are more likely to occur in those with thoracic lesions (> 90% of patients with thoracic lesions develop scoliosis)(24) -Impaired gross motor skills and functional mobility, often requiring the need for assistive and adaptive devices \u2013Psychological and social issues(24) -Typically have lower IQ scores compared with typically developing peers  -Verbal IQ is generally greater than their performance IQ on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) -Often have more difficulty with math and visual perceptual skills -Children with thoracic lesions tend to have lower IQ scores than children with lumbar and sacral lesions -Tend to have better verbal skills than written skills -They are often described as having verbose but irrelevant conversations, often speaking off-topic and use many routine social phrases \u2013Lumbosacral cutaneous abnormalities, such as a tuft of hair, nevus, lipoma, abnormal blood vessels, dimple, or dermal sinus tract, may suggest the presence of SB but are not definitive signs of SB(46) -In a retrospective study of 54 children in France referred for congenital midline lumbosacral cutaneous lesions, 14 children were diagnosed with spinal dysraphism.

        "Folic acid supplementation recommendations The American Academy of Pediatrics supports U.S. Public Health Service, American College of Medical Genetics, and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommendations: \u2013All women planning or capable of becoming pregnant ingest 400mcg of folic acid/day to prevent NTDs. This may be in the form of a multivitamin, fortified foods, or a combination. This is particularly important prior to conception and during the first trimester(1) \u2013Women who have previously had a NTD-affected  pregnancy, who were themselves diagnosed with an NTD, have a first- or second-degree  relative with an NTD, or who have diabetes mellitus, type 1 (DM1) may be advised to take 4mg starting 3 months prior to conception, if planning to conceive and continuing throughout the first trimester. Genetic counseling is advised to determine their occurrence or recurrence risks, pregnancy management, and the appropriate folic acid intake. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends increasing intake of folic acid to 4mg/day beginning at least 1 month prior to conception and continuing through the first trimester(1) -Based on a Cochrane systematic review of five randomized and quasi-randomized  trials evaluating daily periconceptual folic acid supplements with or without other vitamins and minerals in 6,105 women(44) -Compared to placebo/control, daily periconceptual folic acid supplementation through 12 weeks\u2019 gestation was associated with a significant reduction in overall NTDs and NTDs in women with a previous history of NTD-affected pregnancy(44) The Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in Canada issued its practice guidelines(1) \u2013Education for all women of reproductive age about the importance of folic acid supplementation \u2013Women of reproductive age should maintain a healthy diet \u2013Consumption of a daily, recommended multivitamin \u20135mg of folic acid ingested to not only prevent recurrence of NTDs but also cleft lip/palate, heart defects, limb defects, urinary tract abnormalities, and hydrocephalus \u20135mg of folic acid will not mask vitamin B12 deficiency \u2013Primary prevention could be accomplished with: 1-4 mg/day of folic acid from supplements and/or fortified food or 5mg for high-risk  groups In 1998, the United States, Canada, and several other countries instituted folic acid fortification of foods, with the U.S. policy of fortifying enriched grain products with 140mcg/100g of folic acid as a mandate(1) \u2013This was implemented because nearly half of all pregnancies are unplanned and because folic acid supplementation compliance has been found to be fairly poor in various published studies(1) \u2013As of 2011, Finland did not permit folic acid fortification of food, citing as the reason the need to determine possible risks of fortification(1) -The main risk of increased folic acid is the masking of megaloblastic anemia caused by a vitamin B12 deficiency. This is generally not an issue for women of reproductive age but rather for women > 65 years of age(1) Folic acid fortification is associated with a reduction in incidence of NTDs based on observational studies in Canada(37) \u2013Food fortification with folic acid was mandated in Canada in 1998  \u2013Incidence of NTDs per 1,000 births decreased from 1.58 prior to fortification to 0.86 during full-fortification  period. This was based on a national study of 1,909,741 births from seven Canadian provinces during the period 1993\u20132002 \u2013American College of Medical Genetics states there is no evidence to support increasing fortification of foods with folic acid greater than the current levels since studies have produced conflicting or inconclusive results about the risks and benefits of increasing fortification of foods(1) Prenatal screening allows for the diagnosis of the majority of cases of MMC before birth(24) \u2013Recommendations for initial screening of pregnant women (maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein  and acetylcholinesterase levels) at 15\u201320  weeks postconception who are at high risk include maternal age > 35 years or prior if mother has a history of NTD-affected  pregnancy, positive family history, or known exposure to teratogenic agents. Based on these results, a patient-specific  risk can be calculated and repeat testing of serum levels as indicated(24) \u2013Routine second trimester high-resolution  ultrasound has a 95% sensitivity rate. However, if the images are of poor quality due to maternal obesity or other factors, amniocentesis can be performed to obtain amniotic fluid alpha-fetoprotein  and acetylcholinesterase levels at 14\u201318  weeks postconception(24) \u2013Prenatal detection of SB is important to educate the patient and family regarding the diagnosis and management options. Genetic counseling should also be provided. Early detection allows for the medical team to prepare for a safe delivery in a medical center that can perform surgical repair to the neonate(24) It is important for individuals with SB to be transitioned to a multidisciplinary adult healthcare team that is capable of managing adults with SB. Some patients may choose to be followed by their pediatric providers into adulthood if there is not an appropriate adult care team in their vicinity(24) \u2013Adults with SB remain at risk of developing neurologic complications such as VP shunt infections and malfunctions, syringomyelia, and symptomatic type II Chiari malformation \u2013Ideally, adolescents and young adults with SB can be transitioned from a pediatric SB clinic to a multidisciplinary adult spinal cord injury clinic. The long term health care needs of individuals with SB are similar to those with spinal cord injuries, such as bowel and bladder management, personal hygiene, self-management  skills, mobility, vocational planning, and sexual adaptation(46) -U.S. researchers conducted a study to assess the effectiveness of transitioning 24 adolescents and young adults with SB from a pediatric SB clinic to an adult spinal cord injury clinic. Interviews were conducted with 24 subjects and 16 parents. The overwhelming majority of participants (82%) were very pleased with the transition despite having initial concerns regarding the transition. They reported having the unexpected benefit of being \u201ctreated like an adult and were the focus of the care\u201d"
