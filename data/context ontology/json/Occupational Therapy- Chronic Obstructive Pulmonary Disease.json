These guidelines are divided into three major areas, with the following goals: \u2013Controlled breathing at rest -Patient uses pursed-lips  breathing with prominent, spontaneous abdominal muscle movement -Patient demonstrates inward displacement of the abdomen with expiration and outward displacement with inspiration through the use of body positions -Patient demonstrates a slow, deep, fluid breathing pattern -Patient demonstrates little movement of shoulder girdle, upper rib cage, and head with breathing -Patient\u2019s expiration is two to three times longer than inspiration \u2013Controlled breathing with activity exertion \u2013 during light and heavy physical energy expenditures (2\u20135 metabolic equivalent levels) -Patient reports less dyspnea with activity exertion -Patient inhales during body movements against gravity, with pulling movements, and with arm elevation    -Patient exhales during the more strenuous part of an activity, during body movements towards gravity, with pushing movements, and with lowering the arms -Patient relieves dyspnea by moving slowly or stopping to rest -Patient uses leaning forward positions (sitting, standing with arms supported and fixed in shoulder internal rotation and adduction) following activity exertion to relieve dyspnea -Patient avoids moderate to maximum forward bending of the torso \u2013Dyspnea-related  anxiety managementPatient reports confidence with managing dyspnea -Patient reports tolerance and less fear of dyspnea -Patient reports less anxiety with participation in physical and social activities associated with dyspnea -Patient reports increased participation in activities that were being avoided due to dyspnea -Patient reports that rest consistently resolves dyspnea \u2013The Canadian Thoracic Society Clinical Practice Guidelines for the management of dyspnea and dyspnea-related  anxiety in patients with COPD,makes the following recommendations:(25) -Evidence supports the use of oral opioids, neuromuscular electrical stimulation, chest wall vibration, pursed-lip breathing, and walking aids for dyspnea management in patients with advanced COPD -Oxygen is recommended for patients with resting hypoxemia only.There is no evidence to support oxygen use to reduce dyspnea in non-hypoxemic patients -There is insufficient evidence to support use of anxiolytic medications, nebulized opioids, acupuncture, acupressure, distractive auditory stimuli such as music, handheld fans, counseling, or psychotherapy \u2013Researchers in Canada conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis  of the use and efficacy of active mind-body therapies (AMBMT)such as yoga, tai chi, qigong, and focused meditation as an adjunct intervention to pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) for patients with COPD(26) -10 RCTs involving 762 participants were included in the research -Primary outcome measures for review were QoL (SF-36), dyspnea (CRQ Dyspnea Scale) and serious adverse events -Results showedthat the addition of AMBMT to PR resulted in statistically significant improvements in QOL measures; however, there were no significant changes in self-reported  dyspnea or occurrence of adverse events. Researchers concluded that further high-quality  studies are needed \u2013Researchers conducting a scoping review and internet scan of occupational therapy research and practice involving adults with chronic diseases identified 19 articles involving patients with COPD. They identified the following practice areas:(16) -Multidisciplinary PR \u2013 Three RCTs identified advice on coping with ADLs, mobility devices, and stress management as the OT role. Other studies addressed home modification, energy conservation techniques, cleaning, dressing, feeding, and self-care  for respiratory treatments -Relaxation \u2013 one RCT that examined the effect of guided imagery -Practice descriptions describing the use of energy conservation, adaptive techniques during ADLs, strategies to overcome dyspnea, ADL/IADL training, adaptive equipment, work hardening, and leisure education and counseling -Patient perception of OT intervention\u2013  qualitative studies \u2013In a 2018 RCT researchers explored the clinical impact of a quick, one-session  relaxation training for patients with COPD (17) -38 participants with COPD were recruited and randomly assigned to either the experimental group (EG) or control group (CG). Participants in the EG listened to an 11-minute  relaxing audio track, while the CG watched an 11-minute documentary movie with neutral contents -At baseline and shortly after the intervention, participants were assessed. Assessments includedparticipants\u2019 psychological state (psychometric questionnaires) and pulmonary and physiological function (spirometry, oxygen saturation level, and heart rate) -Researchers found that the participants in the EG showed more positive outcomes on cardiac and respiratory function tests and reported decreased anxiety compared to the control group \u2013Researchers in Sweden investigated the effectiveness of energy-conservation  techniques (ECTs) in patients with COPD (19) -32 patients with COPD were included in the study. Participants were instructed in ECTs to use during 5 standard ADL tasks -Energy expenditure (MET and oxygen saturation) was assessed with a gas exchange system during one of the five standard ADLs before and after the 2-week intervention period    -Results showed significantly lower MET and less desaturation while performing the same activity after the intervention \u2013In a 2014 review of the literature seeking to identify the role of occupational therapy in addressing lifestyle behaviors in chronic cardiac, respiratory (including COPD), and diabetic conditions, investigators concluded that occupational performance coaching based on occupational therapy theory could be effective in enabling persons with COPD to maintain healthy lifestyle behaviors(18) .

It is usually progressive and can be accompanied by airway hyperreactivity.It may be partially reversible(1) \u2013Chronic bronchitis is defined by excessive secretion of bronchial mucus and is manifested in a daily productive cough for 3 or more months or more in at least 2 consecutive years \u2013Emphysema denotes abnormal permanent enlargement of air spaces distal to the terminal bronchiole, with destruction of their walls and without obvious fibrosis",
            "There is a decline in lung function that is both duration-  and dose-dependent.  Cigarette smoking is considered the most important cause of COPD in North America and Western Europe(1) \u2013An estimated 80% of patients with COPD have had significant exposure to cigarette smoke and the remaining 20% usually have a combination of exposure to noxious stimuli (environmental tobacco smoke, occupational dusts and chemicals, and indoor air pollution from biomass fuel used in cooking and heating in poorly ventilated buildings) -Outdoor air pollution, airway infection, familial factors, allergy, and hereditary factors have also been implicated in chronic bronchitis",

It causes more than 700,000 hospitalizations every year and is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States. The annual cost of COPD in the United States exceeds $42 billion(2)",
