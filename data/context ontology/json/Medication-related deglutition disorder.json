            "Dysphagia refers to difficulty swallowing due to an inability to move food or liquid efficiently during the oral, pharyngeal, or esophageal phase of swallowing.(1) The oral phase includes sucking, chewing, and moving the food or liquid into the throat. The pharyngeal phase is the initiation of the swallowing reflex, when food or liquid is squeezed down the throat and the airway is closed off to prevent aspiration (food or liquid entering the airway) or choking. In the esophageal phase, the openings at the top and bottom of the esophagus move the food or liquid to the stomach by relaxing and tightening(2)"

For medicationrelated  dysphagia, it is of the utmost importance to document all the medications the patient takes, not only those that have dysphagia listed as a side effect. Medicationrelated dysphagia can occur even if dysphagia is not specifically listed as a possible side effect(11) Medications that reduce a patient\u2019s alertness and awareness increase the risk of dysphagia(11) Drug interactions can cause xerostomia (dry mouth)(11) The concurrent use of multiple medications is common among older adults who have complex medical conditions, and the combined side effects of these medications can adversely affect cognitive, communicative, and swallowing functioning. Contact a pharmacist or physician regarding questions about medication side effects(12) anxiolytics, antihistamines, antipsychotics, and opiates that can cause decreased arousal and coordination and lead to dysphagia in older patients(6) antipsychotics, which have been associated with higher incidence of choking and choking deaths among individuals with psychiatric illness.(56) Typical antipsychotics block dopamine receptors, which can result in laryngospasm and dysphagia. Research suggests increased risk of choking when antipsychotics are combined with anticholinergic medications in patients with mental illness(56) anticholinergic medications, antidepressants, antipsychotics/neuroleptics, ACE inhibitors, antiarrhythmics, antiemetics, antihistamines, decongestants, calcium channel blockers, and diuretics, which have all been associated with reduced salivary flow and can lead to xerostomia.(4,11,13) Symptoms of xerostomia include mouth pain, dry tongue, bleeding gums, cracked corners of the mouth, overall dryness (nose, eyes, skin), and badly fitting dentures anticholinergic medications that can also cause impaired esophageal peristalsis(4) CNS depressants (e.g., antiepileptic drugs, benzodiazepines, narcotics, skeletal muscle relaxants) that can result in depressed brainstem function and reduced control of swallowing ability(4,13) neuromuscular blocking agents that can result in weakness of oropharyngeal musculature and cough reflex dopamine antagonists/neuroleptics that can cause movement disorders that result from extrapyramidal reactions (e.g., dystonia, dyskinesia)(14,57) general anesthesia that can result in a suppressed laryngeal cough reflex(5) Local anesthetics (e.g., Novocain used during dental work) can temporarily cause reduced oral sensation that might affect swallowing before they wear off(13) anticholinergic or antimuscarinic medications that affect the smooth and striated muscles of the esophagus that are involved in swallowing (e.g., benztropinemesylate, oxybutynin, propantheline, and tolterodine)(13) Authors of a case study reported spontaneous hemorrhage into a thyroid cyst causing airway obstruction and acute dysphagia in a 55year-old male following anticoagulation therapy for a myocardial infarction(55) Certain medications (bisphosphonates, methylxanthines, aspirin and other NSAIDs, potassium chloride supplements, and medications containing acid or iron) can cause dysphagia related to injury of the esophagus. This can be caused by local irritation when an individual is in a reclining position immediately after taking the medication or because an inadequate amount of fluid is taken with the medication. In these cases, the medications remain in the esophagus too long, which can potentially cause damage and affect swallowing function(13,57) Side effects of treatments for head and neck cancer (medications, chemotherapy, radiation therapy) include oral or pharyngeal mucositis (inflammation or ulceration of the oral or pharyngeal mucosa), xerostomia, dysgeusia (change in taste sensation), odynophagia (painful swallowing), and pharyngitis (inflammation of the pharynx), all of which can impair swallow functioning(15)",

Due to its limitations, a CSE should be used as a complement to other instrumental measures rather than in isolation.(23,24) If oral intake is considered relatively safe, the patient might be observed swallowing different consistencies of food during the CSE.(21) Cervical auscultation (the use of a stethoscope to assess swallow sounds and airway sounds) and pulse oximetry (oxygen saturation is measured before, during, and after swallowing; decreased saturation during and after swallowing is reported to be associated with aspiration) can be used during trial swallows to better detect penetration/ aspiration during the CSE.(21,25) For detailed information on cervical auscultation, see  Clinical Review ...

For detailed information on compensatory therapy for dysphagia, see  Clinical Review ... Dysphagia: Swallowing Therapy -- Compensatory  ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T903567",
            "Diet modification \u2013Changing the food and/or liquid consistency of a patient\u2019s diet can improve safety and efficiency of the swallow as well as reduce fatigue associated with eating. For example, if a patient reports fatigue while chewing, the diet can be changed to mechanical soft texture.(26) If the patient experiences aspiration of liquids or difficulty controlling the liquid in the oral cavity, the SLP can investigate the used of thickened liquids; however, it cannot be assumed that all patients benefit from thickened liquids.(49)The International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative (IDDSI) has provided a standardized framework for clinicians, patients, and caregivers to thicken liquids in order to ensure consistency and accuracy.(50) Liquids can be prepared as thin liquid, slightly thick, mildly thick, and moderately thick liquids per IDDSI flow test.(51) The SLP should also determine (by observing modifications during VFSS), rather than assume, that aspiration is not occurring with thickened liquids(52) -For detailed information on diet modifications for dysphagia treatment, see  Clinical Review ... Dysphagia: Swallowing Therapy --Compensatory  , referenced above",
            "Postural therapy \u2013Several postures have been examined to assist in changing the direction of the flow of the bolus for patients with dysphagia, including the chin tuck, head back, head rotation, and head tilt(49) \u2013For detailed information on postural changes as dysphagia treatment, see  Clinical Review ... Dysphagia: Swallowing Therapy --Compensatory  , referenced above ",
            "Sensory stimuli \u2013Changing the taste, volume, temperature, or carbonation of the food or liquid has been used as a way to heighten sensation and assist with delayed oral onset and/or delayed pharyngeal swallow.(8,26) More research is needed to validate these techniques to determine their effects on a variety of different types of patients(49) \u2013For detailed information on changes to sensory aspects of the bolus for dysphagia treatment, see  Clinical Review ... Dysphagia: Swallowing Therapy --Compensatory  , referenced above",
            "Swallow maneuvers \u2013Swallow maneuvers include the supraglottic swallow, the super-supraglottic  swallow, the effortful swallow, and the Mendelsohn maneuver. Research has documented specific changes in the oropharyngeal swallow due to these maneuvers for some patients; however, further research is needed to determine the patients for whom these maneuvers are most beneficial and the amount of time that these maneuvers should be used. Patients might not be able to perform maneuvers if they are unable to follow instructions or to remember to use the maneuver during each swallow: -Supraglottic swallow: Breath is held before, during, and after the swallow so that the true vocal folds are closed(49) -Super-supraglottic  swallow: Breath is held while the patient also swallows with extra effort(49) -Effortful swallow: Patient contracts the muscles involved in swallowing with great effort(49) -Mendelsohn maneuver: The Mendelsohn maneuver is designed to increase the movement of the larynx and hyoid during the pharyngeal swallow. The patient holds the larynx up by using the muscles of the neck or with the hand(49) -For detailed information on maneuvers in dysphagia treatment, see  Clinical Review ... Dysphagia: Swallowing Therapy -- Swallow Maneuvers -- an Overview  ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T709042 and the series of Clinical Reviews on each specific type of maneuver",
            "Adaptive equipment \u2013Adaptive spoons, cups, and straws can be used to assist patients with dysphagia. For example, if the patient has difficulty achieving a labial seal and cannot drink from a straw, a nonspill cup with a large handle can be useful as a facilitative aid. If anterior leakage continues, spoons can be used to place the liquid more posterior in the mouth.(26) A nonskid mat can stabilize objects on the table.(26) For infants, adaptive nipples, bottles, and intra-oral  appliances can be used",
            "Enteral feeding \u2013If the patient is unable to maintain an adequate level of safety, nutrition, and/or hydration by means of oral feeding, the feeding team might recommend enteral feeding (e.g., nasogastric tube, gastrostomy tube). Counseling and education of the patient and caregivers should be provided by the SLP or feeding team.(8) Children who are fed enterally can have difficulty transitioning to oral feeding due to oral hypersensitivity and oral defensiveness(8) . Problem Goal Intervention Expected Progression Home Program Oral and pharyngeal postdeglutitive residue and gurgly vocal qualityReduce postdeglutitive residueAlternate liquid and solid foods _ _ To reduce and clear postdeglutitive residue, advise the patient to alternate liquids and solids and take small bites if he or she can safely handle liquids without aspiration(10)Progression will vary according to individual patient goals and learning stylePatient will typically need to use swallowing techniques during all oral intake  Oral and pharyngeal dysphagia due to reduced pharyngeal contractionIngest food and liquids safely (without aspiration)Postural treatment _ _ Postures such as the chin tuck (chin down), head tilt, or head turn might be used to provide airway protection(10)Progression will vary according to individual patient goals and learning stylePatient will typically need to use posture while swallowing during all oral intake Oral and pharyngeal dysphagiaIngest food and liquids safely (without aspiration)Swallow maneuvers _ _ Swallow maneuvers that can assist in compensating for reduced sensation or muscle strength and prevent aspiration during the pharyngeal stage include the supraglottic swallow, the super-supraglottic swallow, the effortful swallow, and the Mendelsohn maneuver.
