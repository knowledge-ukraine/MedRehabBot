When the patient is able to see the ball, he or she will immediately name the object. Agnosia is modality specific, and deficits will coincide with the type of agnosia the patient has.

Investigators hypothesized that due to the brain  damage that caused prosopagnosia, the patient had less healthy brain tissue with which to learn new information. The treatment protocol for this patient actually seemed to \u201cuse\u201d too much of this healthy brain function, leaving the patient better at the treatment task but worse at the carryover goal of recognizing faces.(7) With agnosia, it is important that the therapist continually assess the patient\u2019s progress to ensure treatment is ameliorating rather than exacerbating the symptoms",
                "Patients with agnosia are also at risk for swallowing and feeding difficulties. Ensure that the patient and family/caregivers are aware of potential aspiration risks and educated about strategies when appropriate"

        },
        "diagnosis need for treatment": "The diagnosis of agnosia is made when the patient fails to recognize items in one specific modality despite intact sensory perception. The specific type of agnosia is determined based on the modality and the type of symptoms with which the patient presents",
        "rule out": "Any and all other speech, language, cognitive, or sensory impairments must be ruled out or identified as contributing to the patient\u2019s failure to recognize or identify objects, sounds, or language. In order to differentiate a language disorder, such as Wernicke\u2019s aphasia, from a pure word agnosia, the speech-language pathologist (SLP) must determine that the patient\u2019s language center is intact. This can be accomplished with written language portions of standardized tests such as the BDAE and the WAB",

            "Remedial approach \u2013In a remedial approach for auditory agnosia, the therapist would drill the patient on environmental sounds.(4) Examples of tasks would be: -playing a sound and asking the patient to identify it -playing a sound and asking the patient to identify it given an array of pictures -naming a sound and then asking the patient to identify it from a set of sounds played \u2013Research on this approach for auditory agnosia has not shown it to be effective(4) \u2013Remedial approaches for pure deafness/auditory verbal agnosia can also include drills and lip reading(1,5,6) -Therapist can drill minimal pairs with the patient in order to improve the patient\u2019s auditory discrimination of speech sounds; minimal pairs are words that differ by only one distinctive feature (e.g., \u201cmad,\u201d \u201csad\u201d) -Fast ForWord is a commercially available computer program that drills auditory language(1) -Therapist can educate patient on the lip postures that correlate to phonemes and drill the patient to increase proficiency -According to preliminary research and case studies, both minimal pair drills and lip-reading  strategies can improve auditory comprehension in pure word deafness(5,6) \u2013Remedial approach for visual agnosias -Drills to practice discrimination between common objects(4) -Easy Street Environment: used at hospitals and rehab centers, the Easy Street Environment is a modular community with life-size  streets, banks, ATMs, stores, and offices with which the patient and therapist can simulate real-life  situations to improve functional object recognition(4)  -The patient is asked to match identical objects to each other, working up to matching an object to a drawing and to matching an object to its written name(1) -Group therapy might be appropriate for patients with visual agnosias -In a study conducted in Sweden, researchers found that patients with visual agnosia improved by watching adults without agnosias and picking up clues (e.g., looking at others during a meal to remember which utensil was a fork)(17) -In a case study involving a male patient with visual agnosia, measurable improvement was noted in object recognition scores following a course of therapy that centered around therapeutic activities that indirectly trigger visual representations (e.g., woodworking, sketching)(9) -The author of this study recommended the following types of activities to achieve these results with other patients with visual agnosia: -Activities requiring gazing and visual attention(9) -Sketching -Coloring -Activities requiring both visual and tactile senses(9) -Woodcarving -Leather crafting -Metal carving -Activities that do not require continuous visual stimulation(9) -Working with stained glass -Creating a mosaic with tiles or colored paper -Recreational activities(9) -Fishing -Basketball -Developmental prosopagnosia -Holistic face training might improve face recognition in children with developmental prosopagnosia(25) -Based on a study conducted in the United States with 24 children with developmental prosopagnosia; half of the study participants were treated immediately and the other half were placed in a delayed-treatment  control group -The goal of the training was to increase the subjects\u2019 ability to better recognize feature spacing (e.g., space between the mouth and nose, distance between eyes and eyebrows) -Treatment consisted of a computer training program for 15 days, 30\u201340  minutes per day using different lifelike faces created with a face-making  software program -At baseline and after training, researchers assessed front-view face discrimination, face discrimination with viewpoint changes, and holistic face processing. The subjects in the treatment group demonstrated moderate but significant overall training-related improvements on measures of front-view  face discrimination compared with the delayed-treatment  group. The subjects who progressed through the training to the most difficult levels (i.e., those who were the best responders to the training) exhibited the greatest improvements in front-view  face discrimination and demonstrated significantly increased holistic face processing, achieving scores similar to typically developing controls -Authors of a case study utilized Greebles, which are 3-D computerized objects made up of a \u201cbody\u201d and 4 \u201cappendages\u201d protruding from the main body(7) -The patient (who had prosopagnosia and object agnosia) was trained over 31 sessions to identify the Greebles as \u201cmale\u201d or \u201cfemale\u201d as well as to recognize specific Greebles that were assigned an \u201cidentity\u201d -The goal of therapy was to train the subject to focus on specific features in order to improve facial discrimination -Results were measured by naming accuracy as well as reaction time -In this study, the patient learned to correctly identify the Greebles as well as demonstrated a decrease in reaction time -Therapy appeared to generalize to object naming, as post-therapy tests of object naming improved; however, there was a detrimental effect on facial recognition, as post-therapy  tests of facial discrimination were less accurate \u2013Remedial approach for tactile agnosia -Have the patient feel a variety of objects with his or her eyes closed, followed immediately by looking at the object to provide visual feedback(4) -Limited research has been done regarding the efficacy of this type of treatment(4) ",
            "Compensatory strategies \u2013Compensatory strategies for auditory agnosia include utilizing the patient\u2019s intact senses to alert the patient to danger, urgency, or alarms(6) -Use flashing lights on anything around the house that typically makes a sound (e.g., telephone, doorbell, smoke alarms) -Use vibrate function on cell phone -Use bed-vibration  alarm clock -Patients with phonagnosia would be instructed to utilize strategies on the phone such as caller ID and asking the person on the other line to identify him or herself when calling(1) \u2013Compensatory strategies for pure word deafness include focusing on the intact language skills -Patient carries pen and paper at all times in order to have people write to communicate -Closed captioning on the television(1) \u2013Compensatory strategies for prosopagnosia include training the patient to utilize alternative cues to improve facial recognition -Focusing on a unique facial feature such as a scar, mustache, eyebrow shape, crooked teeth, or nose shape that can be associated with a specific person(1) -Asking friends and family members to speak when they approach the patient is helpful because patients with prosopagnosia generally can identify voices immediately(6) \u2013Compensatory strategies for pure object agnosia include: -utilizing intact sensations such as touch and hearing to identify an object (e.g., have the patient describe an object out loud to trigger its name; or reach out to touch the object carefully to aid recall)(1,4) -putting tactile markers with varying textures around the house (e.g., putting Velcro on the stove or by the electrical panel to indicate danger and soft material such as felt on the telephone to indicate safe items)(1) -organizing the home to increase independence (e.g., having a caregiver hang pieces of clothing that match together in the closet; organizing the refrigerator so that fruit is always on the left, dairy is on the top shelf)(1) \u2013Compensatory strategies for simultagnosia include: -Patient can describe everything he or she is seeing aloud and deduce what \"whole\" is being seen(1) -The patient might require modeling from the therapist when learning this technique (e.g., with a kitchen, \u201cI see a refrigerator, a stove, a sink, a microwave. I think I\u2019m looking at a kitchen\u201d) -Color-coding  items in closets and drawers to help the patient focus on desired item(10) -Using functional adaptive equipment such as a talking watch or calculator(10) -Using brightly colored cards to keep place while reading or writing(1,10) \u2013Compensatory strategies for tactile agnosia include: -Utilize intact vision by having the patient describe the object he or she is touching to trigger its name(4) .
