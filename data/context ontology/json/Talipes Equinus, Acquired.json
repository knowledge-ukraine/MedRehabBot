            "Authors of a 2019 RCT study conducted in Australia concluded that static calf stretching did not provide any significant changes to ankle dorsiflexion ROM and no significant changes in the amount of pressure placed on the plantar surfaces of the foot(6) \u2013Sixty-eight  adults with an ankle equinus deformity were randomized to either the stretch group (n = 34) or usual activity group (n = 34) \u2013Participants in the stretch group performed static standing calf stretches held for 30 seconds and repeated 4 times a day. The intervention was performed daily for 5 days a week for 8 weeks \u2013After the 8-week  study, comparisons of the stretch group and usual activity group found no significant differences in ankle dorsiflexion ROM, weight-bearing ankle dorsiflexion, or forefoot in-shoe  /barefoot peak pressures . Problem Goal Intervention Expected Progression Home Program  Ankle or foot pain/ tenderness and swelling due to abnormal weight-bearing; wound care postsurgeryResolve inflammation of soft tissues; heal wounds _ _ Protect painful tissuesPhysical agents and mechanical modalities _ Apply cryotherapeutic agents as needed for pain (avoid using over wounds). Activity modification, weight- bearing restrictionAllow 2\u20133 weeks for woundto heal and swelling to subsideIce bag (as instructed) to reduce pain and swelling Calf muscle-Achilles tendon contracture with restricted ankle dorsiflexionResolution of contracture. Improve flexibility of plantar flexors to increase dorsiflexionElectrotherapeutic modalities _ Evidence is lacking to warrant use of modalities to treat acquired equinus _ _ Manual therapy _ Passive joint mobilization in dorsiflexion and manual stretching of plantar flexors to improve dorsiflexionGradually progress intensity of joint mobilizations and exercises; 5x per week to daily for 4\u20136 weeksProvide patient with passive calf stretching exercises. Daily repetition of stretches Atrophy, weakness, and impaired activation of calf muscles after surgeryIncrease strength and activation of calf musclesTherapeutic exercise _ Progressive resistance exercise programProgress each patient as appropriate and indicated following surgeryProvide activities for home that support postoperative protocol Deficits in posture, balance, walking/stair climbing ability _ _ Weight-bearing on forefootNormal balance and ambulatory function following corrective surgery _ _ Plantigrade foot position on standingFunctional training _ Posture, balance exercises, proprioception exercises, and gait reeducation _ _ Prescription, application of devices and equipment _ Orthosis (AFO) and shoe modifications might help support/ protect affected tissuesProgress as indicated and allow 4\u20136 weeks to achieve goals _ _ N/AProvide patient with written instructions for exercises and functional activities to be performed at home and on correct use/application of equipment ."
