Therapy approaches include behavior management, vocal hygiene, patient/parent/teacher education, and direct voice therapy.(1) Nodules and polyps may be treated medically or behaviorally, and surgery is rare for children.(4) Behavioral voice therapy is typically the preferred first-line  treatment intervention.(23) Because treatment often involves behavioral change, it is important to have parent and teacher involvement.(2) One of the major challenges in pediatric voice therapy is poor motivation for change and a lack of awareness that change is necessary. Activities that promote understanding of normal vocal function and the disorder are recommended(2) . Problem Goal Intervention Expected Progression Home Program Phonotrauma Child and child\u2019s family will understand the effects of vocal abuseChild and family education: normal voice production and vocal abuse _ The SLP can educate the child (when developmentally appropriate) and family about normal anatomy and physiology of voice production using drawings, video, handouts, and/or props. When possible, the use of videoendoscopic images of the patient\u2019s larynx is useful for conveying information about the physiology and anatomy of the vocal mechanism(12)The child and child\u2019s family will understand basic principles of voice production and the effects of vocal abuse(12)A home program may include educational materials for the parents and child to read together  Phonotrauma and poor ability to discriminate between healthy and unhealthy vocal behaviorsChild and child\u2019s family will better discriminate between healthy and unhealthy vocal behaviorsDiscrimination training _ The SLP can play audiotaped recordings of the child\u2019s voice and have the child and/or family rate the child\u2019s productions to better discriminate between healthy and unhealthy vocal behaviors.(21) V ocally abusive behaviors include frequent coughing, throat clearing, loud crying, sharp glottal attacks, or grunting. In addition, vocally abusive patterns such as screaming, using excessively strained voices (e.g., \u201cfunny\u201d voices associated with characters), singing loudly, or talking over background noise must be eliminated(12)The child and child\u2019s family will better discriminate between healthy and unhealthy vocal behaviorsA home program may include assignments to chart child\u2019s progress with good vocal behaviors at home Phonotrauma and poor vocal hygieneChild and child\u2019s family will understand the importance of hydration for the health of the larynxChild and family education: vocal hygiene _ The SLP can educate the family about the importance of maintaining good vocal hygiene: _ Dehydration requires increased air pressure (subglottic) to initiate vocal fold vibration, resulting in increased tension and strain on the vocal folds. _ Hydration decreases strain/tension on the vocal folds and lowers the risk of edematous (swollen) tissue(1)The child and child\u2019s family will understand and implement principles of good vocal hygiene(12)A home program will include following principles of good vocal hygiene  Phonotrauma Eliminate vocally abusive behaviors by direct therapyDirect voice treatment _ The following is an example of direct voice treatment for phonotrauma: _ Easy onset of voice and resonant (front focused) tone: Make child aware of a sharp glottal attack or tense voice by having him or her feel the difference between rapid onset of initial vowels in words (\u201cair\u201d) as opposed to the more slowly produced /h/ + vowel sequence (\u201chair\u201d).(12) _ Practice with the / h/ onset should be accompanied by using a front focus (resonant) tone. To make the child aware of front focus resonance, have the child use techniques such as blowing bubbles while voicing, blowing into a straw (with a cup of water) while voicing, using a kazoo, or making raspberries. The child should use front focus resonance and easy onsets in increasingly more complex language tasks (e.g., words, phrases, sentences)(22)The child will learn to use a healthy voice in increasingly complex language tasksV oice exercises should be practiced at home to assist the child in generalizing new behaviors ."
