            "As defined by the International Continence Society (ICS), fecal incontinence (FI) is the involuntary loss of liquid or stool that is a social or hygienic problem. It is sometimes referred to as accidental bowel leakage(32)",
            "The most common frequency measure for diagnosis of FI is at least one episode per month for the past year(48)",
            "FI is considered one of the most psychologically and socially debilitating conditions in an otherwise healthy individual. It may lead to social isolation, low self-esteem  and self-confidence,  and even depression(34)",

Of the participants with FI, 70.1% reported liquid stool incontinence(26)"

Only 2\u20135% of patients with FI seek treatment, possibly due to the social stigma of this condition(27) treatment(39) \u2013Participants included 157 patients in 8 centers in France, all with the diagnosis of anal incompetence (i.e., at least a gas or liquid leak once a week for at least 6 months with impact on quality of life) \u2013Standard treatment was diet counseling and pharmacology (i.e., osmotic laxatives, bulking agents, loperamide). Perineal retraining with biofeedback focused on acquiring competence at anal voluntary squeeze and abdominal and pelvic coordination (manual techniques, biofeedback with anal device, abdominal breathing) through both long and short contractions with rest periods \u2013Outcome measures that were significant were self-evaluation  of symptoms and symptom diaries \u2013Using a multivariate model with adjustments for sex, age, and past history of anorectal surgery still showed a significant association between use of biofeedback and higher chance of self-rated  improvement Biofeedback training may provide greater benefits than PFE training alone(17) \u2013Based on an RCT in the United States that compared results of six 1-hour training sessions over 3 months in 2 groups -PFE-only  group (n = 63) -Manometric biofeedback training plus PFE (n = 45) \u2013At 3-month  follow-up,  FI severity was reduced more and anal canal squeeze pressure increased more in the biofeedback plus PFE group \u2013Adequate relief was reported by 76% in biofeedback group compared to 41% in PFE-only  group TENS of the posterior tibial nerve may improve symptoms(18) \u2013Based on a French pilot study that included 24 patients with FI but no control group \u2013TENS was applied for 20 minutes daily for 3 months \u2013Thirteen patients (54%) reported symptomatic improvement at 3 months\u2019 follow-up and 11 (46%) at 15 months Acute stimulation of the dorsal genital nerve may improve rectal tone and capacity in patients with supraconal spinal cord injury and neurogenic FI(19) \u2013Based on a small Danish trial with 7 participants (median age, 50 years) with a diagnosis of a complete spinal cord injury \u2013Using plaster electrodes and an amplitude of twice the genito-anal  reflex threshold (pulse width: 200 \u03bcs; pulse rate: 20 Hz), stimulation was applied to the dorsal genital nerve \u2013A pressure-controlled  phasic rectal distension protocol was repeated 4 times with subjects randomized to stimulation during the 1st and 3rd distension series or the 2nd and 4th distension series \u2013Rectal cross-sectional  area and pressure were measured using impedance planimetry and manometry \u2013Rectal cross-sectional  area was smaller during stimulation, which was applied at a mean amplitude of 51 mA, or about twice the genito-anal  reflex threshold \u2013Researchers concluded that acute stimulation of the dorsal genital nerve may improve rectal tone and capacity in patients with supraconal spinal cord injury and FI Anal and PF exercises using computerized visual feedback may reduce the severity of symptoms and improve QOL in persons with FI(20) \u2013Based on a randomized trial in Australia with 72 participants \u2013Group 1 (n = 37) performed sustained submaximal anal and PFEs \u2013Group 2 (n = 35) performed a \u201crapid squeeze\u201d maneuver plus the sustained submaximal exercises \u2013Sixty-nine  patients attended the 5 clinic sessions. Of these, 100% reported improved QOL and 86% reported improved rectal continence \u2013However, there were no significant differences between the groups Biofeedback for training the anal sphincter can improve patient QOL regardless of the initial severity of FI symptoms(25) \u2013Based on a study conducted in Brazil with 52 subjects and no control group \u2013Subjects completed the FISI and FIQL prior to the initial biofeedback training session and within the first month following the last biofeedback session \u2013Subjects participated in an initial set of biofeedback training sessions (each 30 minutes) under the guidance of a trained physical therapist. If a patient did not respond well to the initial 10 sessions, then the patient participated in an additional 10 treatment sessions  \u2013FISI scores were significantly lower (between 48.1% to 65.4% lower) following the biofeedback intervention \u2013Results from the FIQL showed significant improvements in behavior, depression, and embarrassment domains on the FIQL following biofeedback training \u2013There was no significant correlation between improvement in functional parameters evaluated by FISI and the improvement in QOL .
