Active release technique performed for restricted sacroiliac complex and quadratus lumborum muscles was associated with resolution of low back pain and bilateral anterolateral thigh paresthesia in a young, pregnant (16 weeks) woman.(14) However, the presence of low back pain and pain on palpation at L2-3  would question the diagnosis of MP in this case study .
