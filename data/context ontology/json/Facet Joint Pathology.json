Degenerative changes in one part of thesystem affect the system as a whole(1)\u2013Authors of cadaveric and imaging studies have concluded that disc degeneration precedes facet degeneration(1)\u2013Facet joint cartilage is not innervated. However, facet joint pain can arise from nociceptors within and surrounding thejoint(5)-Facet joints are well innervated, as are the subchondral bone, synovium, synovial folds, and the joint capsule-Facet joint pathology can secondarily result in reflex muscle spasm of the erector spinae, multifidi, and other paraspinalmuscles(9)\u2013Trauma secondary to acute injury or sporting activities(4)\u2013Synovial inflammation of the facet joint may be exacerbated by rheumatoid arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis(4)\u2013Degenerative changes of facet joints include osteophyte formation, hypertrophy of the articular processes, thinning of thearticular cartilage with erosions and subchondral cyst formation, joint effusion, and hypertrophy or calcification of thejoint capsule and ligamentumflavum(4)"
