            "A spinal cord injury (SCI) is a traumatic injury causing damage to the spinal cord; nontraumatic spinal cord lesions (such as tumor or infection) generally result in similar signs, symptoms, and deficits and require the same general assessment and therapy techniques(1)",
            "An SCI is the consequence of a moment of significant hyperextension (forcing the neck or spine backward), hyperflexion (forcing the neck or spine forward), lateral flexion (forcing the neck to the side), axial loading (compression of the spine or neck from a hit on the top of the head), and/or rotational force (twisting of the spine or neck) that results from an acceleration/deceleration force causing extreme displacement of the vertebrae, thereby damaging the spinal cord(2,3)",
            "SCIs can be partial or complete(4) \u2013With a partial SCI, the spinal cord can relay some information to and from the brain; patients with partial SCIs might experience some sensory and motor function below the level of the partial injury(4) \u2013In a complete SCI, all sensory and motor function below the level of the injury is lost(4)",
