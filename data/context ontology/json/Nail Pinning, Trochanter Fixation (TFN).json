            "The Titanium Trochanter Fixation Nail System (TFN) is a titanium alloy third-generation  internal fixation device for proximal femur fractures, primarily trochanteric (intertrochanteric and subtrochanteric) fractures. Third-generation  devices were developed to reduce implant-related  complications associated with fixation of trochanteric fractures \u2013Two versions(26) -The standard TFN is used for stable and unstable trochanteric fractures, pertrochanteric fractures, intertrochanteric fractures, basal neck fractures, or any combination of these -In addition to any of the above types of fractures the long TFN is used for subtrochanteric fractures, pertrochanteric fractures associated with femoral shaft fracture, pathologic fractures of osteoporotic bone in both the trochanteric and diaphyseal regions, long subtrochanteric fractures, proximal or distal nonunions, malunions, or revisions \u2013The TFN is designed to reduce cutout rates and the risk of femoral shaft fracture.(1) Design characteristics of the TFN include: -Helical blade, rather than a screw, inserted into the femoral head without drilling -An anatomic 6\u02da valgus angle in the femoral shaft component",
            "Several classification systems for trochanteric hip fractures have been proposed.(2,) The AO classification(2) with groups has been noted as the most reliable(3,4,5) \u2013AO classification for trochanteric fractures -The AO designation for proximal femur fractures passing through the trochanteric area is 31-A.  This fracture type is defined by a line passing through the lesser trochanter. The groups are: -A1 \u2013 simple pertrochanteric (both trochanters) fracture \u2013 the fracture line starts anywhere on the greater trochanter and ends either above or below the lesser trochanter -A2 \u2013 multi-fragmentary  pertrochanteric fracture \u2013 the fracture line starts anywhere on the greater trochanter and runs toward the medial cortex -A3 \u2013 \u201ctrue\u201d intertrochanteric fracture \u2013 the fracture line passes between the two trochanters",
            "General description of the surgical technique for implanting the TFN(1) \u2013Following anesthesia, a closed reduction of the fracture is performed \u2013Under fluoroscopic control, a guide pin is inserted into the tip of the greater trochanter from the proximal direction \u2013A channel is then drilled into the femoral canal and the nail is inserted  \u2013A second guide pin is then advanced into the femoral cortex and femoral head \u2013The helical blade is then inserted into the femoral head using light mallet blows \u2013The device is then locked into place \u2013A drain is used for 24\u201348  hours after surgery"
