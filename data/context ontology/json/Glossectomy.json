The initial literature review included 189 patients enrolled in various studies for lingual cancer treatment; however, only 21 met inclusion criteria and 9 more were excluded from the data analysis portion for various reasons, including patient death.(26) Authors of this systematic review found that at 12 months postsurgery 7 of the 8 patients who were still alive were on oral diets; however, 3 of these patients remained on G-tube  feedings as well because of 5+ second pharyngeal swallow delays. Researchers also found that for the 8 living patients, average sentence intelligibility scores dropped by an average of 15% from preoperative levels.

The maxillofacial prosthodontist specializes in the improvement of chewing, swallowing, and speech with the aid of prosthetic treatment.(3) If the patient is undergoing an extensive tongue resection, a gastroenterologist might perform a preoperative evaluation and procedure for a gastric tube.(16) A clinical social worker can see the patient at the time of diagnosis, during treatment, and during rehabilitation to assist the patient in understanding the course of treatment. Referral to a counselor might be necessary for patients experiencing grief and depression. Nurses might provide assistance in oral hygiene care and care of a tracheostomy if needed.

            "Reconstructive surgery, prostheses, and speech training are approaches used to improve articulation and swallowing after glossectomy(3,18) \u2013In a pilot study conducted in Australia with 2 participants who had undergone partial glossectomy, researchers found that dysphagia therapy provided with verbal cues supported by biofeedback using an ultrasound transducer under the chin resulted in increased use of self-initiated  swallow strategies and reduced instances of aspiration. Additionally, participants achieved improved scores on the Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS). Researchers theorized that patients with dysphagia from glossectomy might benefit from ultrasound biofeedback if they are a) able to see the ultrasound monitor, b) able to hear and understand verbal feedback from the clinician, and c) cognitively able to alter tongue movements according to feedback and recall the goals of intervention(35)",
            "Speech training might focus on maximizing residual tongue tissue movements, developing articulatory compensations, adapting to prosthetic appliances, and modifying negative compensations(1) \u2013There is evidence that patients with better tongue motility post glossectomy have more intelligible speech than those with less tongue motility;(19) however, no studies have directly assessed the effects of oral motor therapy for motility on intelligibility",
            "A significant portion of the tongue can be removed without serious swallowing disability(17) \u2013Speech-language  pathologists (SLPs) can instruct patients on airway protection mechanisms and dietary adjustments to assist with swallowing.(20) In addition, the patient may receive instructions on facilitating the oral phase of swallowing to reduce spillage and assist in movement of the bolus to the pharynx (e.g., head tilt). These strategies will depend on the results of a swallow assessment \u2013In a study conducted in Poland with 95 patients who underwent total or partial glossectomy due to lingual cancer, researchers observed swallowing ability under videofluoroscopy and documented the use of compensatory strategies. In this study, these strategies were all independently initiated by the patients and were not a part of a treatment program. In some cases, multiple swallows per bolus and prolonged breath-holding  during swallowing reduced aspiration for patients with abnormal epiglottic retroflexion. However, the chin-up  and chin-down  maneuvers did not reduce aspiration among those patients who had no epiglottic retroflexion as a result of glossectomy. Researchers emphasized the importance of individualized treatment for patients with dysphagia as a result of glossectomy.(28) Any compensatory maneuver or strategy should be documented as effective in a videofluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS) prior to using it as part of a patient\u2019s treatment plan and home program -For detailed information on compensatory strategies, swallowing maneuvers, and dysphagia treatment, see the series of Clinical Reviews on these topics . Problem Goal Intervention Expected Progression Home Program  Oral communication breakdownsPrevent communication breakdownsConversational repair strategies _ Provide patient with strategies such as: repeat the word or phrase slowly, repeat the word or phrase with a gesture, provide the key or topic word, provide the 1st letter of a word by pointing to an alphabet board, rephrase the utterance, tap one time for each word, write the word or phrase on a dry-erase board or paper. Patient can be cued to use strategies as needed. Caregiver can also be taught to cue patient to use strategies(8)Initially, the patient will learn the strategies at the word level; progression moves from the word level to the phrase level, then sentence level; finally, strategies are utilized in conversational- level speechPatient should use conversational repair strategies at home, work, and within the community Oral speech does not yield functional communicationUse AAC device effectivelyProvide training in the programming and use of an AAC device _ Training will vary with patient\u2019s communication goals and device. Most devices can be trialed at no cost before purchaseInitially, the patient will learn to use the device at the word level; progression moves from the word level to the phrase level, then sentence level; finally, the patient can utilize device in conversational speechAAC device will be used at home, work, and within the community Articulation and swallowing deficits due to impaired tongue mobility and reduced tongue massRestore oral function by providing a lower palatal vault to re- establish palatolingual contact during speech and swallowingPalatal augmentation prosthesis (PAP) _ An SLP might collaborate with a maxillofacial prosthodontist in assessing a patient\u2019s need for a prosthesis _ _ See Treatment summary , aboveN/A Home program will vary with respect to the goals of the patient  Articulation errors due to impaired tongue mobility and reduced tongue massDevelop compensatory articulations that allow for increased intelligibilityArticulation therapy _ The production of vowels, alveolar consonants, velar consonants, and palatal consonants will be most affected by glossectomy.Therapy can focus on maximizing intact skills and developing articulatory compensations. Examples of objectives include differentiation of isolated vowels with bilabial phonemes, overarticulating, self- monitoring through use of auditory feedback, using substitute articulations, using pause and reduction of speech rate to increase clarity, and coordinating management of saliva and speech.(1) No studies have isolated specific treatment practices for glossectomy for examination of their efficacyTherapy for articulation generally progresses from sound level to syllable, word, phrase, sentence, and finally conversational levelHome program will vary with respect to the goals of the patient Reduced tongue mobilityIncrease tongue mobility to increase articulation abilityOral motor/lingual exercises _ _ See Treatment summary , aboveIncrease repetition and duration of oral motor exercises as lingual strength and mobility increaseHome program will vary with respect to the goals of the patient  Dysphagia Increase swallow safety Dysphagia therapy _ Therapy will vary according to the results of a swallow evaluation. Treatment might include strategies for airway protection, strategies for facilitating oral phase of swallowing, and dietary adjustments. (For detailed information on assessment and treatment of dysphagia, see Clinical Review\u2026 Dysphagia: an Overview  and Clinical Review\u2026Dysphagia: Patients with Head and Neck Cancer , referenced above)As the patient\u2019s swallow improves, the SLP will increase the frequency and intensity of dysphagia exercises as well as the difficulty of the trials of food and liquid that are given in therapyHome program will vary with respect to the goals of the patient ."

        "Prior to surgery, the patient and family should be informed about the effects of glossectomy and the prognosis for speech and swallowing. Patients should be advised that surgery can result in unintelligible speech and inability to swallow but that in most cases, normal speech and swallow return several months after surgery.(16) Immediately after surgery, the patient may not be able to speak due to inflammation and/or the presence of a nasogastric tube and should be given communication strategies to use with hospital staff and family. Examples of strategies include: Patient\u2019s communication partner asks only yes/no questions Patient mouths words in an exaggerated fashion to communicate Patient points to an alphabet board to indicate the first letter of each word as he/she mouths it  Patient uses a dry-erase  board or paper and pencil/pen to write messages Patient uses a picture communication board to indicate basic needs",
