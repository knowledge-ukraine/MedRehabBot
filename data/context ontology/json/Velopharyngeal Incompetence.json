Patients with VPD will usually exhibit greater nasality on the words with high vowels (/u/ and /i/) and less nasality on words with low (/a/) vowels(22)  -If the patient is unable to produce words, ask him or her to repeat syllables 10-15  times each (/pa/, /pi/, /ta/, and /ti/) and listen for nasal emission(28)The patient should be asked to repeat words and phrases containing high-pressure consonants (e.g., \u201cPass the pepper please,\u201d\u201cTerry took the top hat,\u201d \u201cChoosy kids choose Jif\u201d).(22) Individuals with VPD may exhibit significant hypernasality or nasal air emission on the consonants in the sentences. Sentences with many high-pressure  consonants, especially those that are voiceless (e.g., \u201cSissy sees the sun in the sky\u201d) are the most sensitive to nasal emission(28)Ask the patient to count from 60-80,  which is especially difficult for individuals with VPD. Listen for hypernasality and nasal air emission(22,28) -Cleft Audit Protocol for Speech-Augmented  (CAPS-A)  is a valid and reliable speech tool that can be used to analyze speech articulation and nasality in children over the age of 5 years. Percentage of consonants correct is calculated. In addition, hyponasality is rated on a 3-point  scale ranging from \u201cabsent\u201d to \u201cmarked hyponasality.\u201d Patient hypernasality is rated on a 5-point  scale indicating \u201cabsent\u201dhypernasality to \u201csevere\u201dhypernasality(16) -Temple Street Scale is another perceptual rating of nasality scale that may be used for patients of all ages (who are verbal). Hypernasality is rated on a 6-point  scale, and hyponasality is rated on a 4-point  scale from absent (within normal limits) to severe hyper-  and hyponasality(29) -Instrumental measures -Nasality can also be measured using a nasometer. This system calculates the numeric ratio of nasal to nasal plus oral energy to arrive at a nasalance score. Normal nasalance is between 25% and 33%.(16) Scores above 30% indicate some degree of hypernasality(12) -Researchers stress the need to use instrumental measures, such as a nasometer, in addition to perceptual measures, when assessing hypernasality.(29) Both perceptual ratings and nasalance scores give valuable information and should be used together(23) -Some studies have found positive correlations between nasalance scores and perceptual testing, while other studies have found low correlations. Therefore, nasalance scores should not be used as a substitute for perceptual methods of evaluation.(23) Nasal airflow can be measured using a pneumotachograph and a nasal mask, and can give a SLP quantitative, objective data about velopharyngeal function and timing of velopharyngeal movements(31) -Pittsburgh Weighted Speech Scale can be used to report severity of VPD and hypernasality and is a common perceptual speech assessment tool in (verbal) children of all ages (median age of patients who are tested using this measure is 5.5 years)(32) \u2013Oral manometry \u2013 can be used on patients of all ages to measure intraoral air pressure. Mean oral air pressure below 3 cm H2O is considered abnormal, and may indicate VPD and VP openings during oral speech. If the VP port is not sufficiently closed during oral speech, reduced oral air pressure will result, affecting high-pressure  sounds such as /p, b, t, d, k, g/(27)Visual imaging through instrumental measures can help the SLP, surgeon, and team decide if management through surgery is appropriate for the patient, and if so, which surgical procedure is best(30)Research literature supports the use of both of these measurements to directly visualize velopharyngeal gap size and velopharyngeal function(5,33) -Flexible fiberopticnasendoscopy allows the SLP to visualize the velopharynx during phonation. The degree and pattern/type (coronal, sagittal, circular, circular with Passavant\u2019s ridge) of VP closure can then be observed.(22,33) Closure pattern is important when deciding which surgical procedure is appropriate.(23) In addition, tonsils and adenoids, fistulas, and submucous clefts can be identified(33) -Use instrumental measures to determine the size of the VP gap (which has been found to be positively associated with VPD severity), the location of the gap, the shape of the gap, the consistency of the gap, and the movements of the velum, lateral pharyngeal walls, and posterior pharyngeal wall(33) -Document atypical patterns(22) -Asymmetrical valving of the VP port -A deep midline indentation of the velum, which may allow air to escape -A prominent bulge of the midline velum, which may allow air to escape from the sides  -Midline indentation of the adenoid tissue, which may allow air to escape from the midline -A midline bulge of the adenoid tissue may allow escaped air from the lateral sides -During nasendoscopy, note ability to drink juice from a straw (note any leakage), blow out a candle, whistle, start a yawn (document the presence of strong velar elevation), and repeat words from the Nasal Emission Test, the Pressure Consonants Test, and the counting test. Observe VP function during tasks(22) -Nasendoscopy allows the examiner to observe abnormalities in the bird\u2019s eye view and shows velar elevation.(33)Nasendoscopy is often used in postoperative evaluations for individuals with repaired cleft palate(5) -Because of the cost of MRI, and the radiation exposure associated with videofluoroscopy, nasendoscopy is the most commonly used instrumental measurement of VP(5) -Multiview videofluoroscopy (MVF) allows anterior-posterior  and lateral views of the velopharynx and can be used to analyze pharyngeal and palatal movements.(5) MVF allows a better view of lateral wall movement than does nasendoscopy(33) -Videofluoroscopy imaging is better in the coronal plane as compared to MRI(5) -Lateral cephalometric radiographs can give information about the relationship of the velum to the posterior pharyngeal wall, velar length, pharyngeal depth, size of VP opening, and size of adenoid tissue relative to VP area. This assessment does not allow for observation of VP activity in movement(12) -Levator muscle electromyography can be used to assess LVP muscle activity and can also be used to as a preoperative assessment to determine if a patient is at higher risk for developing VPD as a result of maxillary advancement surgery. Reduced LVP activity might be associated with higher probability of postoperative VPD(34)",

Neither procedure resulted in significant hyponasality or nasal obstruction. The results of this study support the importance of preoperative evaluation and the assessment of degree of VPD, which is vital when determining a course of treatment or management(43) -In a retrospective study conducted in the United States, researchers analyzed pre- and postoperative videofluoroscopic and speech data for 29 children (ages ranged from 3.5 to 14.3) who underwent Furlowpalatoplasty to correct VPD. In this study, the total length of the soft palate increased by 19-20%  and there was videofluoroscopic evidence of significant levator musculature tightening and retropositioning.

In fact, in children born with unilateral cleft lip and palate, 59% exhibited excellent speech following this procedure. In children with VPD and no cleft, the surgery had only a slightly positive impact on speech (only 29.4% had excellent results), especially when the child was already exhibiting CMAs(45) -Research indicates that type of VP closure pattern may be a predictor of successful pharyngeal flap surgery resulting in normal resonance balance. A higher percentage of patients with noncoronal closure patterns are able to achieve normal resonance following surgery than are patients with a preoperative coronal closure pattern.

            "Speech therapy \u2013The principles of speech therapy intervention for patients with VPD are as follows: -Determine which phonemes to target first based on stimulability testing as these sounds are likely to have the greatest impact on intelligibility; these may not necessarily follow developmental sequence of acquisition(37) -Utilize a phonological approach if there are several errors in one class of speech sounds(37) -Include visual and auditory discrimination tasks to ensure that the child can perceive the difference between an error sound and the target sounds(37) -In general, begin with anteriorly produced sounds as they are most visible(37)  -For continuant sounds (such as /l/, /r/, /f/, or /s/, in which the closure of the vocal tract is incomplete, allowing the continuous passage of the breath), begin with the voiceless cognate and add voicing; for plosives (e.g., /b/, /p/), the voiced cognate is easier in most cases(37) -Begin with the sound in isolation for continuants; begin with consonant-vowel  syllable for plosives (e.g., /ba/)(37) -Establish the sound in syllables correctly prior to moving to single words(37) -Establish placement first, then manner (including voicing)(37) -When transitioning from teaching one sound to the next, change only one feature at a time (i.e., placement, manner, voicing, or movement)(37) -If the patient has difficulty transitioning from the consonant to the vowel, separate them with an /h/ sound and gradually close the time gap to achieve the desired syllable (i.e., /p/\u2026/ha/)(37) -For most sounds, establish the sound in initial position before attempting to work on the other positions; an exception for this principle is the /r/ sound which is a continuant in the final position and should be established first(37) -Educate the patient\u2019s parent(s)/caregiver(s) about how to practice sounds at home (even as little as 10 seconds at a time) several times per day; provide specific instructions(37) \u2013In many cases, some speech (articulation) treatment is warranted even before surgical management of structural anomalies. Articulation therapy may be helpful in both improving articulation errors and improving degree and strength of velopharyngeal closure. Direct treatment aims to both improve articulatory placement as well as eliminate VP mislearned patterns and CMAs(6,27) \u2013Specific techniques -Improving articulatory placement(6,27) -Use visual cues -Use nasal occlusion as necessary at start of treatment to direct air flow -Develop appropriate articulatory awareness and precision -Eliminate VP mislearned patterns(6,27) -Train awareness of nasal airflow through the use of auditory, visual, and tactile feedback -Encourage overarticulation and increased volume to improve articulatory accuracy -Use negative practice and description exercises to increase client awareness. This is done by asking the patient to produce the incorrect production on purpose \u2013Sometimes, the cleft palate/craniofacial team chooses to recommend speech therapy (velar training) for a trial period before resorting to surgery. However, velar training might not help with consistent audible nasal emission on high-pressure  consonants. In addition, velar training is not recommended unless at least some velopharyngeal closure ability is observed. If velar training is recommended, patients should be closely monitored throughout the process(22)",
            "Corrective Babbling (CB) \u2013CB is a phonetic-based,  parent-implemented  treatment approach that was designed for children who have articulation errors related to cleft palate. In CB, children are taught to repeat nonsense syllables in nonmeaningful contexts (i.e., babbling) as the foundation for later word, phrase, and sentence productions. The goal is to reproduce babbling that occurs in typically developing infants as the foundation for normal articulation.(59) CB is implemented by parents or teachers who have been trained by an SLP(59) \u2013In a study conducted in Canada, researchers investigated the effectiveness of CB in 13 children ages 4 to 16 who were at least 4 months postsurgery for either cleft palate or VPD. All of the children in the study spoke English as their primary language; two of the children had histories of significant exposure to a second language, and one 4-year-old  child\u2019s first language was Chinese, but was primarily exposed to English after being adopted at age 2. Participants in the study were assigned to an immediate treatment group or delayed treatment group to allow for comparisons to be made between groups while still allowing all children the opportunity to have therapy. Each participant\u2019s parent was given a copy of the CB manual and trained by an SLP in therapy delivery. Parents were instructed to provide CB therapy for 10 minutes per day for four months. At the conclusion of therapy, outcome measures were performed. 7/13 parents reported that they took off time from doing the therapy and 6/13 reported reducing the frequency (some participated every other day, others once a week). At the group level, the immediate treatment group did not make significantly greater gains than the delayed treatment group (i.e., during the same time period, those receiving therapy did not make greater speech improvements than those who were not). At the individual level, there were no consistent patterns but most individuals  made significant gains in one or more contexts over the course of 4 months. Parents reported general satisfaction with the program. Researchers concluded that CB therapy holds promise for children with cleft palate or VPD; however, further research is necessary to establish efficacy(59)",

            "Prosthetic management \u2013When surgical management for VPD is contraindicated, prosthetic management is a good alternative as a temporary or permanent treatment option. Sometimes, prosthetic treatment is also used following previously failed surgery, as part of an evaluation of the VP, or as a diagnostic trial.(50) Children with VPD or cleft palate may require feeding plates, maxillary molding devices, palatal obturating plates (used in babies and toddlers while they develop correct articulation), palatal plates to close fistulas, and speech bulbs and palatal lifts.(27) SLPs must help the patient ascertain whether prosthetics are the right choice for him, decide which prosthetic device is the best fit, and, once the device is in place, teach the patient to use oral speech and correct any CMAs. This is done by training the patient to feel and hear the difference between oral and nasal speech, replacing CMAs with oral consonants, and discovering how the prosthetic can help the patient change his or her speech sound production(27) \u2013Palatopharyngeal obturators/pharyngeal bulbs/speech bulb obturator -Custom-made  dental appliances with an acrylic bulb placed in the velopharynx -Some lateral pharyngeal wall movement is important so that lateral pharyngeal walls can approximate the bulb, allowing for oral airflow and resonance -Quiet nasal breathing is still possible through the sides of the bulb -Obturators can also be used as training devices to teach client to maintain oral air pressure(27) \u2013Palatal lifts -Dental appliances with acrylic addition on back lift the soft palate up and back -Best for individuals with long, soft, and immobile soft palates(50) -Can also be used as training devices(27) -Have been shown to improve speech function, especially in individuals with dysarthria(40) \u2013In a study conducted in the United Kingdom involving 16 patients with VPD (mean age 10 years), researchers found that use of prosthetic devices did reduce overall hypernasality and nasal air emission in some patients. No significant differences in hyponasality were found before or after/during the intervention. The majority of patients in this study continued to use their prosthetic devices as long-term  management(50) \u2013Authors of a case study with a 5-year-old  boy with highly unintelligible, hypernasal speech after cleft palate repair and VPD reported on the fabrication of a palatal lift for the child to wear during waking hours. The lift was removable and stayed in place with wire extensions around the teeth. The child in this case study was mature enough to manage basic care and placement/removal of the lift independently. In addition to the palatal lift, the child participated in speech therapy  for 6 weeks targeting elimination of compensatory articulations and use of biofeedback to normalize speech sounds. After two months, the authors reported a marked reduction in hypernasality and compensatory articulations (no specific outcome measures reported)(60) \u2013Nasal obturators may be used to increase oral pressure needed for speech. Nasal obturators or nasal speaking valves (NSVs) can also be used for patients who dislike the palatal lift prosthesis due to increased difficulty swallowing and repeated clinical adjustments(51) -One-way  nasal obturators allow a patient to breathe in, but close during exhalation, precluding nasal emission -Plastic nose frame to fit in nares, with a one-way  valve component(52) -Used in patients when surgery or other prosthetic devices is inappropriate(52) -One-way  valve allows for nasal breathing but reduces escape of nasal air emission(52) -Increases oral pressure needed for speech(52) -An NSV that is custom fitted allows for controlled exhalation and reduced air escape(53) -An NSV is more comfortable and can be worn for longer than a palatal lift(51) -Authors of a case study involving 2 patients with VPD found that the use of a nasal obturator decreased nasal air emission. Some air still escaped during speech through the sides of the obturator. This may be prevented in the future with custom-fitted obturators. Both individuals in the study exhibited improved intelligibility and articulation during the use of the obturator. Weaknesses of the study include small subject number and lack of a control group(52) -Authors of a case study found that a NSV improved overall speech intelligibility and was more effective than the palatal lift device. The patient reported that the NSV was more comfortable than the lift and could be worn for longer. Weaknesses of the study include small subject number (N = 1)(51) -Researchers in Japan found that NSVs improved the intelligibility from 51% to 90% on average in the 7 subjects involved in the study. The study addressed the advantages of NSVs over nasal obturators, asserting that custom fit allows for minimized air escape and more controlled exhalation(53) .
