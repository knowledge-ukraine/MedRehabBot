The following variables are associated with increased risk for ACLinjuries in females:(9,10,13,27,38)-Anatomical(10)-Increased Q-angle(9,10)-Increased genuvalgum(9,10)-Increased pelvic tilt(36)-Smaller ACL (cross-section  area, length, and volume)(9,10,36)-Decreased collagen fiber density(36)-Tibial plateau differences(36)-Increased posterior-inferior  slope of the lateral tibial plateau-Femoral notch differences(9,10,36)-Narrower femoral notch width(9,10)-Taller femoral notch height(36)-Smaller femoral notch angle(36)-Increased hypermobility/joint laxity(10,36)-Hormonal influences, particularly estrogen levels(9,10,36)-Monthly hormonal changes may decrease ligament or muscle strength and place females at a greater risk of sustainingan ACL injury during the preovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle than during the postovulatory phase(10,36)-Elite female athletes with elevated serum relaxin concentrations may be at greater risk for ACL injury(36)-Cyclic variations in knee laxity are of sufficient magnitude in some women to substantially alter their knee jointbiomechanics(36)-Estrogen, testosterone, and relaxin receptors on the ACL and skeletal muscle suggest that these sex hormones have thepotential to directly influence these structures at the knee joint(36)-Biomechanical(9,10,13)-Neuromuscular imbalances (increased quadriceps activation and decreased hamstring activity during landings)(9)-Hamstring muscles are very important to stabilizing the knee joint during landing tasks. A lowerhamstring-to-quadriceps  ratio has been shown to contribute to an increase in genuvalgus and tibial rotation anglesduring dynamic movements, which increase loading of the ACL(38)-Girls (age 10\u201313  years, Tanner stage II) with decreased hamstring strength (~2x lower hamstring-to-quadriceps  ratio)have significantly greater valgus at the knee, reduced hip abduction, and greater ACL loading at the time of peakanteroposterior ground reaction forces when landing from a leap compared to girls with stronger hamstring strength,according to the results from an Australian study of 33 healthy girls(38)-Altered neuromuscular control in the lower extremity: Females demonstrated increased knee abduction and ankleeversion in a jumping maneuver in a study of 54 males and 72 females (all adolescents)(10)-Female athletes with limited sagittal plane motion during landing exhibit a biomechanical profile that may put them atgreater risk for ACL injury, according to a study in the United States (13)-The subjects were 58 female competitive soccer players (ages 11\u201320  years) with no history of knee pain-Subjects were grouped by their hip and knee flexion angles during the deceleration phase of drop-landing.Subjectswith decreased hip and knee flexion had increased knee valgus, increased knee adductor moments, and decreasedenergy absorption at the hip and knee as compared to subjects with increased hip and knee flexion Consequently,subjects with increased reliance on the knee extensor muscles on landing may be at greater risk of ACL injury-In a follow-up  study, the same authors foundthat an ACL injury prevention training program improved use of thehip extensor muscles on drop-landing,  thereby decreasing knee extensor moments and increasing energy absorptionat the hip(56)-Movement patterns (e.g., sudden deceleration, change of direction cutting movements, landing from a jump in kneehyperextension vs. flexion)(9,36)-ACL strain is related to maximal load and timing of ground reaction forces. A more erect posture is commonlyassociated with increased vertical ground reaction forces. Thus, a more upright posture when contacting the groundduring the early stages of deceleration tasks has been implicated in ACL injury(36)-Authors of a systematic review of studies published between 1982 and 2011 analyzed factors proposed to contribute tothe between-sex  disparity in noncontact ACL injuries from the onset of puberty(27)-Despite evidence confirming that estrogen receptors are located on the ACL, there remains conflicting evidence as tohow and whether estrogen affects the metabolic and mechanical properties of the ACL, particularly in pubescent girlswho have not yet begun menstruating-Unlike boys, girls do not undergo an accelerated increase in muscle strength during puberty, particularly evident inhamstring strength(27,38)-In addition to evidence that suggests girls display an increase in knee valgus alignment throughout puberty, theirhamstring muscle strength appears to lag behind that of their quadriceps strength. These two components combinedmay alter girls\u2019 ability to stabilize the knee and protect the ACL during dynamic landing movements-More longitudinal studies are needed to examinelower limb musculoskeletal structural and functional changes (e.g.,strength, flexibility, knee joint laxity) experienced by girls throughout puberty and how these changes are related toestrogen fluctuations or how they affect girls\u2019 ability to jump/land safely-In addition, studies need to be conducted to analyze the effects of puberty on the neuromuscular activation patterns orlower limb biomechanics when both boys and girls are performing sport-specific  movement patterns",

Less clearly defined is which surgical technique should be performed and what is the most optimal postoperative rehabilitation program. There is no consensus(31,32) The rationale for surgical intervention for ACL tears includes stabilizing the knee in order to prevent functional instability as well as reduce the risk of developing additional meniscal and articular cartilage injuries caused by ongoing abnormal joint forces(28) Orthopedic surgeons need to consider the patient\u2019s physiologic age and potential for growth by reviewing the patient\u2019s radiographs to determine bone age. Bone age must be determined when deciding on the operative procedure in order to minimize the risk of growth disruption.(48) Some surgeons will also consider the use of Tanner staging to classify the patient\u2019s physiologic age(31) Three main reconstruction techniques(9) Bone-patella  tendon-bone  autograft Hamstring autograft Allograft tendon (cadaver) Three types of surgical procedures(16,31) Intraarticular, transphyseal, transosseous reconstruction Greatest risk of physeal injury and growth disturbance.

Twelve studies evaluating conservative management in 476 patients were identified(16) -Results from the systematic review indicated that surgical repair of the torn immature ACL produces superior clinical outcomes in knee function and stability and in the prevention of secondary injury -Conservative management was associated with greater incidence of secondary injuries (meniscal and cartilage) -No difference in growth disturbance between those undergoing surgical repair compared to those receiving conservative intervention -Insufficient evidence to evaluate optimal surgical technique \u2013Surgical repair is typically indicated for young athletes involved in jumping, running, or cutting sports and is also required for persistent instability or in cases with concomitant injuries such as meniscal tears or combined ligament instabilities.

            "Prognosis \u2013The prognosis depends on the severity of the ACL tear and concomitant injuries, such as meniscal tears or MCL strains. There appears to be a consensus in the literature that complete ACL tears that are treated conservatively have a poor outcome, with resulting knee instability, increasing risk of secondary meniscal injury and decreased function(9) -Most patients who are treated conservatively eventually decide to undergo ACL reconstruction; however, delaying surgical reconstruction for a torn ACL increases the risk of secondary meniscal injury(9,16) \u2013Predictors of subsequent ACL or other knee injury despite undergoing ACL reconstruction and rehabilitation -Approximately 1 in 4 young athletes who undergo ACL reconstructive surgery sustain a second knee injury.(42) Documented incidence of ACL reinjury is varied but high, ranging from 6% to 27%, with the highest (24%) short-term (within 2 years postsurgery) second injury rate noted in younger, more active patients(11) -ACL injury is associated with early onset of knee osteoarthritis, regardless of surgical or nonsurgical treatment(9,47) -Swedish researchers analyzed data from the Swedish national ACL register (20,842 patients were included in the final analysis) to identify predictors for reinjury or contralateral ACL injury(45) -Patients included were those who underwent ACL reconstruction between January 2005 and February 2013. Graft type did not predict additional ACL reconstruction; however, only those who underwent hamstring tendon autografts were included for further regression analysis -Seven hundred two patients had revision and 591 underwent contralateral ACL reconstruction -Significant predictors of additional ACL reconstruction were age (a 4-fold  increased rate for those < 16 years of age vs. those > 35 years of age), time between injury and primary surgery (2- to 3-fold  increased rate for ACL reconstruction within 0\u201390  days vs. > 365 days), and playing soccer at the time of the primary ACL injury \u2013Athletes who undergo ACL reconstructive surgery and subsequent rehabilitation are typically out of competitive play for roughly 6\u20139 months(9) -Wells et al. reviewed the course of 55 teenagers (40 girls, 15 boys), mean age 16 years, and reported that the average time from surgery to recovery of 85% of normal quadriceps strength was 5.42 months(15) -Fifty-nine  percent achieved 85% or better strength in < 6 months, with 50% returning to full activity in 6 months \u2013ACL reconstruction in the skeletally immature patient has the risk of causing growth plate injury from tunnel placement or graft fixation and requires thoughtful consideration in the younger population with partial or complete ACL tears; however, there are very few published reports of growth plate arrest. Growth plate injury is avoidable with meticulous surgery(10,13,15)  -Authors of a 2010 systematic review found that the risk of growth disturbances was low; however,at that time no RCTshad compared different surgical techniques or compared surgical to nonsurgical intervention(13) -Femoral or tibial overgrowth is possible with stimulation of an active physis secondary to the operative procedure and this is not always predictable. Additionally, if a growth spurt occurs in close proximity to an ACL reconstruction, there is a potential too for asymmetric long-bone  growth, possibly justifying a delay in ACL reconstruction in some cases(13) -The majority of growth disturbances and angular deformities have been associated with graft fixation devices or bone plugs leading to bony bars across the lateral distal femoral physis, epiphysiodesis effects of fixation devices crossing the tibialphysis, and poorer tunnel placement and tunnel diameter(16) \u2013Research suggests that secondary ACL injury risk is strongly related to multiplanar movement asymmetries of the lower extremities. Multidimensional kinematic data indicate that asymmetrical hip and knee movement patterns and force generation can result in compensatory strategies within both extremities that can also be present in the nonsurgical extremity(42) \u2013Altered neuromuscular control of the hip and knee during dynamic landing and postural instability after ACL reconstructive surgery are predictors of a second ACL injury after an athlete returns to sport(43)"

            "Treatment summary \u2013Post-ACL  reconstructive rehabilitation protocols have evolved significantly over the past few decades. There has been a shift from more conservative efforts with prolonged immobilization and delayed strengthening to current guidelines that promote immediate, protected weight-bearing, early ROM and functional strengthening, and neuromuscular training.(42) The consensus is that a structured ACL physical therapy protocol should be followed with the goals of increasing strength, neuromuscular reeducation, endurance, agility, and coordination.(21) However, research is limited to guide a specific evidence-based  physical therapy treatment approach. There is no consensus on the type or number of exercises to include in the rehabilitation program. At this point, the research is focused on conservative management weighed against surgery, not what type of conservative management yields the best outcomes -Of 625 studies included in a systematic review, only 7 studies provided adequate comparisons between nonoperative and operative ACL groups -Best evidence available was level III, and therefore the authors concluded that data were inadequate to determine whether surgical intervention vs. nonsurgical intervention had better outcomes for skeletally immature children and adolescents with ACL injuries(13) -Authors of a2012 systematic review of treatment studies between 1966 and 2011 found methodological deficiencies that includedsmall numbers of patients in some studies, weak study design, inadequate description of rehabilitation protocols, and poor description of outcome criteria and assessments. Consequently, they recommended caution when interpreting reviews on pediatric ACL reconstruction rehabilitationpublished before 2012(40) \u2013In general, postoperative care/rehabilitation progression for the skeletally immature athlete is similar to that for adults but with greater initial precautions and often a more conservative progression. This may be due to the uncertainty regarding the strength of the graft and the risk of growth disturbances, as well as the lack of evidence-based  practice guidelines(31,32) -The main differences between postoperative rehabilitation in skeletally immature patients as compared to adult patients are as follows: -Slower progression towards jumping and running to reduce the impact of loading on the physis -Less use of external loads -Primarily home-based  functional exercises -Later return to pivoting sports (after 9 to 12 months) -In addition, when implementing strength training for prepubescent athletes an emphasis should be placed on lighter resistance and increased repetitions while maintaining proper body alignment and technique with developmentally age-appropriate activities(21) \u2013For acute ACL injury, it is generally recommended that the patient receive PRICEMM therapy: Protection, Relative Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation, Medications, Modalities(9) \u2013Gait training should be completed in order to properly educate the patient and/or primary caregivers on the proper use of crutches for ambulation with any weight-bearing restrictions, transfer training, and stair negotiation(9)  \u2013Conservative treatment may be an option for carefully selected, highly compliant patients with low physical demands and no other pathologies(16) \u2013Research is limited on rehabilitation after ACL avulsion fractures. It is suggested that postoperative rehabilitation guidelines mimic those for bone-patellar  tendon-bone  ACL reconstruction because both procedures require bony union before significant stress can be placed on the attachment site(12) \u2013General goals for nonoperative treatment intervention in patients with ACL tears are to increase lower extremity strength, restore full ROM, restore functional activity, restore normal gait biomechanics, and improve joint proprioception with closed-chain  exercises.

OKC exercises were performed within a restricted ROM between 90\u00b0 and 45\u00b0 of knee flexion on a locked knee-extension  machine -There were no statistical differences between groups for anterior knee laxity, pain, and functional measures (single-leg  and crossover hop tests) -The early-start  group achieved faster recovery in quadriceps strength and overall strength (5% greater) compared to the late-start  group; however, the magnitude of strength gain was not statistically significant -Phase 1: Preoperative (1\u20137 days) -Focus on regaining full ROM, decreasing swelling, normalizing gait -Studies have shown that achieving full symmetric knee ROM prior to surgery decreases complications such as arthrofibrosis -Progress patient from partial to full weight-bearing  (FWB) as tolerated to assist with normalizing gait -Strengthening exercises begin once swelling and pain are minimal and full knee motion is restored -Patient and family education regarding the basic surgical procedures and postoperative rehabilitation process -Ideally, surgery is schedule once swelling is resolved, full ROM is restored, and patient education completed -Preoperative testing may also include KT-1000 knee ligament arthrometer, isokinetic strength, and single-leg  hop test on the noninvolved leg -Phase 2: 0-2 weeks status post surgical repair -Goals: 1) gain full knee extension, 2) allow soft tissue healing, 3) maintain adequate quadriceps leg control, 4) minimize swelling, 5) achieve 130\u00ba knee flexion, 6) restore normal gait pattern -Combination of normalizing gait and obtaining early knee extension allows the patient to regain good quadriceps tone and lower extremity functional control, which will set the pace for the entire rehabilitation program -Progress from WBAT to PWB to FWB without crutches with a knee extension brace set in full extension -Knee extension exercises are initiated immediately to minimize potential problem of infrapatellar contracture, with the goal of gaining full knee extension; prone position is ideal -CPM device may be used to assist with gaining ROM as well as cryotherapy (ice, Cryo/Cuff) to reduce swelling -Wall slides, heel slides, and active assisted knee flexion assist with gaining knee flexion ROM -Emphasize active quadriceps contraction exercises with exercises such as SLR and quarter squats -Gait training activities: heel-toe  walking, retrowalking, and high-knee  activities -Phase 3: 2\u20134 weeks status postsurgical repair -Goals: 1) full ROM, 2) progression of strengthening exercises, 3) FWB with normalized gait -Patients are typically able to return to school, ADLs, and sedentary work -Aggressive ROM exercises are initiated to achieve full ROM -Increase leg strength with functional strengthening using closed-chain  exercises as the preferred method; may begin jump rope, single-leg hop with slow controlled speed -Focus also on increasing cardiorespiratory endurance (stationary bike, swimming) -Phase 4: 1\u20132 months status postsurgical repair -Goal: Advance strengthening and functional activities -If strength testing shows that the involved leg has 70% of the strength compared to the uninvolved leg, a proprioceptive and light agility program can begin including lateral shuffles, light sports-specific  drills, cariocas, and jump rope -Isokinetic evaluation at 180\u00b0/s and 240\u00b0/s -Increase functional leg strength through single-leg  strengthening exercises as well as weight room strengthening -Sport-specific  functional progression can be developed toward the end of this phase -Agility training and restricted sports participation not only helps the patient regain quickness and functional movement patterns, it also restores confidence in returning to previous functional status -Maintain full ROM and control any swelling that develops during training  -Phase 5: 3-6 months status post surgical repair -Goal: Progression of strengthening and sport-specific  drills with full return of activity -Full ROM with isokinetic evaluation -Strength and conditioning are functionally progressed according to patient\u2019s specific needs; weight room strengthening continued -This period is extremely important for patients to regain full sport-specific  strength as well confidence to return fully to their sport -Return to sport if strength is > 80%, full ROM, no swelling, and successful completion of sport-specific  functional training \u2013Return to sport (RTS) criteria -The current standard of practice for an athlete to RTS after ACL reconstruction is varied. Attempt to return to activity is typically advised 6 months after surgery, but functional performance deficits and gait abnormalities are often still evident and can have important implications for future function. Objective RTS criteria (functional testing and gait biomechanics) can guide clinicians when determining safe RTS(46) -Authors of a 2011 systematic review identified the most frequently utilized RTS criteria in the literature as resolution of symptoms and lower extremity strength impairments, performance on various functional tests, mechanical stability, and temporal guidelines; however, there is no formal consensus to date on the most effective protocol(11) -The most recognized and supported RTS criteria are a comparison between the two lower extremities when performing the four unilateral hop tests (single-leg  jump for distance, single-leg  vertical jump, single-leg  triple jump for distance, and single-leg  diagonal hop for distance) in conjunction with isokinetic knee strength testing(31) -These four single-leg  jump tests are reliable outcome measures and are recommended in combination with isokinetic strength measurements and hip and knee gait biomechanics for functional evaluation of knee stability and ability to safely RTS(40) -Isokinetic strength testing is valid and reliable in children as young as 6 years old. It is the preferred outcome measure of quadriceps and hamstring muscle strength(40) -U.S. researchers conducted a 2013 study to analyze the gait biomechanics of 42 athletes following 6 months of ACL reconstruction rehabilitation(46) -Functional testing included an isometric quadriceps strength test, four single-leg  hop tests, and two self-report questionnaires (Knee Outcome Survey\u2013Activities  of Daily Living Scaleand the Global Rating Scale for Perceived Function) -Three-dimensional  motion analysis was used to measure sagittal plane kinematics and kinetics of the hip and knee -Minimal clinically important differences were calculated from healthy gait data and used to further define meaningful limb asymmetries -Forty-eight  percent of the subjects passed RTS criteria 6 months after ACL reconstruction -Subjects who did not pass the criteria demonstrated statistically significant differences between limbs on all kinematic and kinetic variables at the knee (P \u2264 .027) as well as asymmetries at the hip -Kinetic asymmetries at the knee compared to normative data were identified in the subjects who passed RTS criteria -Researchers concluded that athletes who did not pass RTS criteria not only demonstrated larger kinematic and kinetic asymmetries between limbs but also used a gait strategy more closely aligned with athletes early after ACL rupture -They also concluded that objective RTS criteria can provide important information to clinicians when determining safe and appropriate RTS -In a nonaccelerated ACL postoperative rehabilitation program, return to full, unrestricted activity typically occurs at 9months. If all strength and functional criteria are met prior to the 9th month, it is generally recommended that the patient restrict his or her activity level until the end of the 9th month(41) .

        "Rehabilitation programs need to emphasize core and symmetrical bilateral lower extremity neuromuscular control to minimize the risk of reinjury prior to RTS clearance. Asymmetry in biomechanical neuromuscular control with tasks such as jumping, landing, and cutting can increase the risk of future injury to the same knee or even the other knee(11,43) U.S. researchers conducted a nonrandomized controlled study involving 98 participants: 56 subjects had undergone unilateral ACL reconstruction and had been released to RTS and 42 were uninjured, activity-matched  peers (29 females and 13 males). Subjects were asked to perform a bilateral drop vertical jump maneuver from a 31cm box(11) \u2013Subjects who had ACL reconstruction were unable to equally distribute force between the involved and uninvolved lower extremity during a bilateral landing task. There was no difference between male and female athletes in peak vertical ground landing force. The athletes continued to favor the uninvolved limb despite clearance to RTS \u2013Despite completing an ACL rehabilitation program and being cleared for full return to level I and level II sports, these subjects continued to favor the uninvolved limb with asymmetries in peak vertical ground reaction force during landing from a bipedal task compared to the control group",
        "ACL prevention programs There is a need for additional research in order to develop evidence-based  training programs designed for teaching youth, especially girls, safe and proper landing techniques in an attempt to reduce the incidence of noncontact ACL injuries.(27) There is a void in the literature to validate whether or not prepubescent children respond the same as postpubescent children to ACL programs; however, children as young as 10 years of age demonstrate at-risk movement patterns associated with ACL injury and may benefit from these ACL prevention programs. Late childhood is a critical period for refining movement skills and an ideal time to intervene to reduce the risk of ACL injury(27,37) \u2013Strength training has been proven safe and effective as long as direct supervision is provided and age-appropriate guidelines are followed.(37) Strength training can be safely started in prepubescent athletes as early as age 7 years if designed appropriately with an emphasis on lighter resistance, increased repetitions, proper technique , and coordination. It is important to note that children mature at varying rates and strength training programs must be individualized(21) \u2013Skeletally immature children are prone to overuse injuries; it is very important to gradually increase resistance while increasing flexibility, strength, and motor skills according to age-appropriate  guidelines.(37) Exercises should always be performed in a pain-free  range(21) \u2013Neuromuscular strength training programs should be incorporated into the warm-up  period of training sessions for young athletes in order to reduce the risk of ACL and other knee injuries. This will promote team and player compliance in order to maximize the benefit of the prevention program(44) \u2013Strength training should emphasize gluteus maximus and medius in order to improve dynamic hip abduction and femoral rotation to prevent valgus collapse at the knee(37)  -Gluteus maximus and medius weakness has been identified as a predictor of ACL injury secondary to the inability of the weak muscles to keep the hip abducted during high single-leg  activities such as landing and cutting(37) -Progress exercises from double limb to single-limb once proper form is repeatedly demonstrated -Specific exercises to isolate gluteus medius and maximus: side-lying  hop abduction, side planks, lateral band walk, single-limb  squat, single-leg dead lifts(37) -Emphasize hamstring strengthening in order to assist with preventing dynamic knee valgus and tibial rotation. Examples of eccentric hamstring strengthening exercises are partnered Russian hamstring curls, agility training with unanticipated change of direction, jump landing with emphasis on proper hip, trunk, and knee alignment -Core stability training, proprioceptive training, perturbations, and postural sway corrections should be included in multifaceted strength training(37) -It is important to note that if there is an apparent leg dominance, strengthening each leg in isolation should be emphasized(37) Authors of a 2012 systematic review and meta-analysis  of studies evaluating ACL injury prevention programs found a significant reduction in ACL injuries after a preventive training program(33) \u2013Thirteen studies met the criteria \u2013A greater duration of balance training was associated with a higher risk for ACL injury, while a greater time spent on static stretching was associated with a lower risk for noncontact ACL injuries \u2013Neuromuscular training with proprioceptive, plyometric, and strength exercises may reduce ACL injuries in female athletes(9,36) Sport-specific  training programs incorporating strength, balance, and stability exercises may be beneficial for reducing ACL injury rates in adolescent female soccer players(30) \u2013Authors of a 2009 randomized controlled study in Sweden analyzed the effects of a sports injury prevention program for 230 female soccer clubs, with players ranging from 12 to 17 years of age \u2013There were 2,479 players in the intervention group and 2,085 players in the control group, making this study the largest sports injury prevention study at the time it was published \u2013The intervention group completed a 15-minute  neuromuscular warm-up  program that was intended to replace the conventional warm-up.  The warm-up  included six knee control and core stability exercises: one-legged  and two-legged knee squats, pelvic lifts, bench step-up,  lunges, and jump/landings. Each exercise increased in difficulty \u2013Coaches were instructed to carry out the program twice a week \u2013During the season, there were 96 acute knee injuries, 21 of which were ACL injuries. Two-thirds  of these injuries occurred in the control group \u2013There was an 83% reduction in ACL injuries in compliant players when age, menstrual history, match frequency, and match play were taken into account Using visual and verbal feedback for modifying spike jump training in adolescent female athletes can improve their landing biomechanics as part of an overall comprehensive ACL injury prevention program(26) \u2013Authors of a prospective study in Canada randomized 19 female volleyball players (12\u201314  years of age) into control and intervention groups \u2013All girls were videotaped completing five spike jump approach shots without feedback for biomechanical analysis after a 5\u201310  minute warm-up  that included light jogging and hitting a volleyball backandforth between partners \u2013Each girl in the intervention group (IG) received a verbal review of a checklist of desired movements and positions for landing safely from a jump -Checklist included: Keep your knees in line with your toes when landing from a jump; don\u2019t go into a \u201cknock-kneed\u201d position; bend your knees and hips closer to 90\u00b0 when landing from a jump; land evenly on two feet, with a toe to heel landing; try to land softly, not stiffly \u2013Immediately following completion of the jumps, each IG athlete watched video clips of her own spike jump landings in full speed and slow motion, stopping at relevant frames that illustrated where the athlete could improve on her jump-landing  performance \u2013IG athletes were allowed to ask questions to clarify jump-landing  techniques during the augmented feedback, which averaged 3\u20134 minutes/athlete \u2013After the augmented feedback session, the IG repeated five spike jumps while being videotaped \u2013Filming of five volleyball spikes for each athlete in both groups occurred at 2 and 4 weeks post initial videotape session \u2013There were no differences in landing biomechanics between groups at baseline  \u2013At week 4, statistical differences in maximal hip flexion (~30\u00b0) and trunk flexion (15\u00b0) were greater in the IG. The IG\u2019s maximal knee flexion was20\u00b0 greater than the control group\u2019s maximal knee flexion, but it was not statistically significant \u2013Ankle dorsiflexion, right knee and hip flexion, and trunk flexion improved significantly over the 4-week  period, but left knee and hip flexion did not improve, which may reflect the asymmetric nature of the spike jump \u2013Courtside video and verbal feedback may present a relatively simple, cost-effective  method to effect short-  and long-term improvements in jump-landing  techniques as part of an overall comprehensive ACL injury prevention program \u2013It is important to note that one feedback session may not be sufficient to make long-term  changes for game-specific situations. Rather, repetition of feedback for proper jump-landing  biomechanics is critical to promote motor learning -Athletes in both groups often needed prompting on good landing form before completing their trials at weeks 2 and 4, indicating that the newly acquired skill had not been completely integrated into the athletes\u2019 movement patterns and raising questions as to whether the optimal biomechanics would occur in a game setting at this stage Youth soccer athletes who participate in an ACL injury prevention program over a 9-month  vs. a 3-month  period maintain acquired optimal movement patterns even after discontinuing the injury prevention program(24) \u2013Based on a randomized study of 140 boys and girls (mean age, 14 years) using the Landing Error Scoring System (LESS), which assesses a standardized jump-landing  task \u2013Both treatment groups performed a 10\u201315  minute ACL injury prevention program prior to each practice ~ 3\u20134x  per week during the intervention period, 3 months for the short-duration  group and 9 months for the extended-duration group, and then retested 3 months after discontinuing the training \u2013Injury prevention program included static flexibility, balance, strengthening, plyometric, and agility exercises with customized strengthening and flexibility as indicated based on subjects\u2019 technique with a double-leg  squat (e.g., toe out, medial knee displacement, neutral alignment) \u2013Findings indicate that retention of changes in optimal movement patterns is influenced by training duration; the longer the training program, the greater the retention of optimal movement patterns, indicating that extended-duration training programs may be required to facilitate long-term retention for motor learning \u2013Concept of overlearning principles during movement retraining programs may be a critical factor in developing retention of new movement patterns to reduce the risk of future injury Prevention of ACL injuries in female athletes through early intervention as recommended by the United States Sports Academy(25) \u2013Physical educators are in an ideal position to implement proper muscular training in young athletes in order to reduce the risk of ACL injuries -Muscular training should focus on the hamstrings and quadriceps, with emphasis on increasing hamstring strength since most athletes have strong quadriceps. Females need particular attention because they have been shown to land with less knee flexion, increased quadriceps activation, and less hamstring activation compared to males, which increases the load on the ACL during the landing phase of a jump -Hamstring strength should optimally be 60\u201380%  of the strength of the quadriceps -Recommend the following hamstring exercises: squats (single and double limb), standing knee flexion, paired Russian eccentric knee curls, and standing kickback, as well as heel raises to assist with increasing knee flexion strength -Progress towards jump training with proper form (legs close together, knees touching, landing softly with bent knees, and maintaining balance at all times) -Jumps should be over a small cone -First, jump forward over cone and then backward over the cone returning to the starting position -Second, jump side to side over cone -Start with sets of 20 and increase as tolerated based on the patient\u2019s ability to perform the activity properly Athletes who are dedicated to complying with a neuromuscular preventive training program can significantly reduce the risk of ACL injury compared to athletes who are less compliant with a preventive training program(44) \u2013Based on a 2013 Swedish randomized controlled cluster trial that included 2,471 female soccer players in the training group and 2,085 female soccer players in the control group (12\u201317  years of age) \u2013A physical therapist instructed the team coach and one player on the details of the 15-minute  neuromuscular training (NMT) program. Teams also received a CD-ROM  and written packet describing the exercises. Teams were instructed to complete the NMT program during the warm-up  at two training sessions/week \u2013Coaches documented whether the team completed the NMT program and recorded individual player participants for each session. Physical therapists attended two training sessions during the season unannounced  \u2013The control soccer teams participated in usual training session throughout the season \u2013Outcome measures were compliance, ACL injury rate, and rates of any acute knee injury and severe knee injury (> 4 weeks absence from sport). Players were categorized based on their NMT compliance rate \u2013Players in the high-compliance  tertile had an 88% reduction in ACL injury rate. Players with low compliance with the NMT program had knee injury rates that were similar to or higher than those of players in the control group \u2013As the season progressed, the overall player and team compliance rates significantly decreased, with a 3.0% decrease per month per team and 5.0% decrease per month per player",
