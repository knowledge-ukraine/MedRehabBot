            "Plantar fasciitis is a very common cause of heel pain resulting from overuse microtrauma. In the acute stage, it presents as inflammation at the origin of the plantar fascia(1)",
            "In the chronic stage, the plantar fascia undergoes enthesopathic collagen fiber thickening. The term plantar fasciosis is better suited to describe this stage because fibrotic thickening is considered a degenerative change(1)",
            "Although both terms are in current use, plantar fasciitis is more appropriate when symptoms improve with anti-inflammatory  treatment, which is usually not an effective intervention for plantar fasciosis(1)",
            "This Clinical Review focuses on the evidence-based  management of patients with degenerative changes in the plantar fascia. However, in many research studies comparing interventions for plantar fasciosis, patients with inflammatory plantar fascia disease were included in the study population.(14,15,16,17) This mixing of participants complicates the interpretation of effects specifically for patients with plantar fasciosis"
