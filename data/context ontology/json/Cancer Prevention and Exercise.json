            "Prescription of leisure-time  physical activity or aerobic exercise is a well-established,evidence-based  lifestyle component for promoting health and increasing longevity. \u2013For example, authors of a 2015 meta-analysis  of 6 prospective cohorts (661,137 men and women; median age, 62 years) in the United States and Europe found that participantswith7.5 metabolic-equivalent (MET)  hours of physical activity per week (i.e., 75 vigorous-intensity  or 150 moderate-intensity  minutes) or more had 31% to 37% lower all-cause  mortality from 1992 to 2003 (116,686 deaths were included) compared to those with no leisure time activity(1) \u2013New evidence also supports prescription of leisure time physical activity or aerobic exercise for prevention of cancer. A 2016 meta-analysis  of 12 prospective cohorts (1.44 million men and women, median age, 59 years) in the United States and Europe found that among 186,932 participants with incident cancers from 1987 to 2004, those at the upper levels of MET hours per week had statistically significant lower risks of 13 types of cancer than those at the lower levels of MET hours. The included cancers were colon, breast, endometrium, esophageal adenocarcinoma, liver, gastric cardia, kidney, myeloid leukemia, myeloma, head, neck, rectum, and bladder. Moreover, high physical activity reduced the risk for most of these cancers even in overweight/obese participants and smokers(2)",
            "Health care professionals should counsel physically inactive patients about the cancer risk associated with insufficient exercise and prescribe an individualized aerobic training program according to guidelines(3)",
            "This Clinical Review addresses the potential anticancer role of exercise training in healthy persons and those with high cancer risk"
