Also inspect paretic hand and foot for neglect-related  injuries, such as getting hand caught in wheelchair spokes or not placing foot on wheelchair foot rest \u2022Perception:  No single gold-standard  assessment exists(30) \u2013Many assessments measure function impairment by observing ability to perform paper-and-pencil  tasks. Other assessments measure limitations in activity or participation by observing ability to perform ADLs. Virtual-reality computer-based  assessments have more recently been developed(30) \u2013Researchers in the United States found that detection of neglect may depend on the assessment administered(30) -Their data supports the use of functional assessments and virtual-  reality assessments over the use of paper-and-pencil\u2013based  assessments because they were better at detecting neglect \u2013Obtain results of any neuropsychological tests where available -Results of cognitive testing, vision testing, and testing for perceptual deficits including but not limited to neglect (e.g., agnosia) may be available \u2013A large number of simple and rapid tests have been developed for the assessment of neglect. A combination of several tests is usually recommended because of the variability in the tests that patients fail, probably reflecting differences in the nature of the underlying deficits -See section Special tests specific to diagnosis , below, for a list of perception tests that may be used \u2013When a client is medically stable or has a positive screen for the presence of unilateral neglect, an in-depth  evaluation should be done to identify the specific deficits that require intervention \u2013The Catherine Bergego Scale (CBS) is a perception tool that requires direct observation of post-stroke  patients in everyday activities(38)    -Ten everyday activities: dressing, grooming, eating, mouth cleaning, personal belongings, safe mobility, gaze orientation, auditory attention, spatial orientation, and knowledge of left limbs are evaluated -This scale can also be administered as a questionnaire to assess how the patient self-evaluates  his/her neglect during ADLs using the same scoring system -The CBS captures the heterogeneity of spatial neglect by examining functional performance in personal, peripersonal, and extrapersonal space, as well as performance in perceptual, mental imagery, and motor domains. Thus it is more sensitive than paper-and-pencil  tests(23) \u2013The Kessler Foundation Neglect Assessment Process (KF-NAP)  is an assessment tool based on the CBS(23) -The KF-NAP  provides detailed administration instructions and a scoring chart for the 10 original categories of behavior -The KF-NAP  has been shown to uniquely quantify symptoms of spatial neglect by measuring functional difficulties that are not captured by the FIM or Barthel Index \u2013Tests of neglect might also include asking patients to mime ADL activities, such as combing their hair, shaving, or makingup their face \u2013Inclusion of tests that maintain the complexity of everyday tasks and environments is recommended(31) \u2022Posture \u2013Assess static and dynamic posture in sitting and standing, looking at symmetry(4) \u2013Unilateral neglect interferes with a patient\u2019s ability to maintain static posture -Patients have difficulty maintaining symmetrical posture. They may lean toward the ipsilesional side -Unaware their posture isn\u2019t upright even if leaning heavily onto someone or something -Often unaware they are falling \u2013Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke Patients (PASS)(4) may be used to assess posture \u2013Patients who use wheelchairs tend to slump towards the ipsilesional side of their chair and direct their gaze towards ipsilesional space \u2022Range of motion: Assess active and passive ROM, as well as flexibility throughout(4) \u2022Reflex testing: Assess deep tendon reflexes bilaterally and compare. Assess for primitive reflexes, as well as clonus and Babinski as indicated \u2022Self-care/activities  of daily living (objective testing) : Assess the effect of neglect on self-care  and functional tasks using standardized assessments, such as Rivermead Mobility Index or Barthel Index \u2013The effects of unilateral neglect extend beyond the basic skills for self-care (e.g., bathing, dressing, feeding) to instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) \u2022Sensory testing:  Light touch, kinesthesia, two-point  discrimination, proprioception, texture recognition, deep sensation(4) \u2013Assessment of kinesthetic deficits is important. In a study involving 158 individuals an average of 18 days post stroke, researchers in the United States found that the presence of visuospatial neglect is highly predictive of the presence of kinesthetic deficits; however, the presence of kinesthetic deficits does not necessarily indicate the presence of visuospatial neglect(24) -Participants with neglect had impaired kinesthesia 100% of the time, whereas only 59% of participants without neglect had impaired kinesthesia \u2022Special tests specific to diagnosis: There are more than 60 measures that assess neglect.(30)Currently there are no clinical practice guidelines to help therapists select neglect assessment tools.(30) Perception tests and batteries commonly used to test for neglect include the following: \u2013Star cancellation test(41) -Patient crosses out small stars when arranged with large stars and letters -The more stars that are omitted, the greater the neglect \u2013Comb and Razor test(3) -Good test-retest  reliability -Tests personal space \u2013Semistructured scale for the functional evaluation of hemi-attention  in personal space(3) -Asked to demonstrate use of comb, razor/powder compact, eyeglasses presented in midline -Good interrater reliability;

            "Estimates of the frequency of neglect vary and depend on the tests and criteria used \u2013Although unilateral neglect can occur after damage to either hemisphere, left neglect due to right hemisphere damage is much more common, longer lasting, and more severe than right neglect due to left hemisphere damage \u2013In the acute phase, prevalence of neglect is reported to be around 50% in right brain lesions(37)",

            "Unilateral neglect is usually difficult to treat.(10) This may be because it is likely due to different combinations of neuropsychological deficits rather than a disruption of just one cognitive process(10) \u2013One single therapeutic intervention is therefore unlikely to be successful with all individuals with neglect(10) \u2013Clinical guidelines recommend use of interventions that focus on the relevant functional tasks, taking into account the underlying impairment(10) \u2013Evidence from several clinical trials has shown that a variety of interventions are effective at improving occupational performance in patients with unilateral neglect; however, further research is needed to determine whether combining these effective interventions would have an additive effect(18)",

The paretic hand was hidden behind the mirror and the unaffected hand was placed in front of the mirror, so that patients could see the unaffected hand in the mirror and not the paretic hand. While patients performed flexion and extension of the unaffected wrist and fingers they were asked to do the same movements with the paretic hand, and they saw the reflection of unaffected hand as being movements of the paretic hand -Training was done 1\u20132 hours per day 5 days per week -The control group did similar exercises for a similar period of time but with the nonreflective side of the mirror facing the unaffected hand (and the paretic hand out of sight) -Outcome measures included the star cancellation test, the line bisection test, and picture identification task. Secondary measures included the FIM -Improvement was seen in the primary outcome measures in patients who received mirror therapy compared to the control group. Based on the FIM scores, patients in the treatment group were more likely to be independent at 6 months -It was hypothesized that when the nonparetic limb is engaged during motor training, crossed facilitatory drive from the intact hemisphere can cause increased excitability in the homologous motor pathways of the paretic limb",

The authors concluded that passive limb activation appeared to ameliorate the asymmetric spatial representation and reduce the unilateral spatial neglect, especially in the extrapersonal space related to wheelchair driving -Performance did not improve in the other patient \u2013There is moderate-quality  evidence for the effectiveness of noninvasive brain stimulation combined with other therapies on hemispatial neglect and ADL performance after stroke(34) -Based on a 2017 meta-analysis  that included 10 RCTs with a total of 226 participants  -Stimulation included repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) -Because there is great variability among noninvasive brain stimulation protocols, generalizing resultsis problematic -Treatment effects of the stimulation techniques (tDCS or rTMS) revealed a large effect size for hemispatial neglect and a medium effect size for performance in ADLs \u2013tDCS combined with feedback training (FT) was found to provide a positive effect on unilateral visuospatial neglect in patients who have experienced a subacute stroke(35) -Twelve patients were randomly assigned to either the experimental group (tDCS + FT) or control group (FT only) -The experimental group received 20 minutes of tDCS treatment along with 30 minutes of FT treatment 5 days a week for 3 weeks.
