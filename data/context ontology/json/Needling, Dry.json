        "An APTA resource paper on the clinical use of DN emphasizes that DN is one tool in a broad treatment approach and should be combined with other techniques (soft tissue mobilization, ROM, exercise, neuromuscular reeducation, etc.)(27)",

        "An MTrP is defined as a localized, hyperirritable spot in a nodule of skeletal muscle(5,6) consisting of an accumulation of sensitized nociceptors in the end plate zone of muscle fibers. Clinical characteristics of an MTrP are the following:(8) Palpable, taut band that can be snapped or rolled and contains a highly localized tender spot \u2013Stimulation (e.g., compression, palpation, needling) of the band usually elicits a twitch response Limited ROM and increased sensitivity to stretch Characteristic referred pain pattern that is familiar to the patient Painful, weak, easily fatigued muscle with minimal or no measured or observable atrophy Associated sensory(8) (e.g., tenderness, reduced pain threshold, pain referral), autonomic(6) (e.g., local hyperthermia, referred hypothermia), and proprioceptive(6) (e.g., balance disturbance, weight perception, dizziness) phenomena",
        "MTrP formation and classification(6,8) The generally accepted mechanism of MTrP formation is muscle trauma resulting from low-level,  sustained muscle contraction,(9) direct trauma,(8) or acute, repetitive, or chronic muscle overload from eccentric muscle contraction \u2013The underlying trauma alters the motor endplate, leading to excessive acetylcholine release and local sustained contraction, resulting in ischemic changes and sensitization of peripheral nociceptors. This proposed explanation is called the integrated TrP hypothesis(6,8,10) MTrPs are classified as active or latent(5) \u2013Active MTrPs are associated with spontaneous local or referred pain and/or pain on movement,(7) while latent TrPs require direct stimulation to trigger pain symptoms(8) Both active and latent MTrPs are associated with muscle dysfunction, including weakness, restricted ROM, and fatigability(6,8) Lowered pain threshold in muscle tissue is associated with both active and latent MTrPs MTrPs are associated with most, if not all, chronic pain syndromes(8)"

            "Neck, shoulder, upper quarter \u2013Authors of a 2015 systematic review and meta-analysis  of the effectiveness of DN for MTrP associated with neck and shoulder pain concluded that DN can be recommended for relieving MTrP pain in the short term (0\u20133 days) and the medium term(33) -Based on 20 RCTs involving 839 patients  -Authors also determined that other therapies (including physical therapy) were more effective in treating MTrP in the medium term \u2013DN performed on the lower trapezius TrP was more effective at treating pain (measured by V AS and Neck Pain Questionnaire) and pressure-pain  threshold than DN to another area of the lower trapezius muscle(34) -Double-blind  RCT conducted in Spain -Seventy-two  patients with unilateral neck pain for \u2265 3 months and active trigger points in the lower trapezius were randomly assigned to either DN to lower trapezius TrP or DN to other area of lower trapezius muscle \u2013One session of DN to the latent MTrP associated with the key active MTrP in the infraspinatus muscle reduced pain intensity and satellite MTrP irritability in the short term in older adults with nonspecific shoulder pain(48) -Based on a RCT involving 66 patients in Spain who were 65 years of age or older -Groups received either DN to both the latent MTrP and the active MTrP or to the active MTrP only -Outcome measures were the numeric pain rating scale, the pressure pain threshold on the anterior deltoid and extensor carpi radialis brevis latent MTrPs, and grip strength \u2013Two treatments of TrP-DN  are as effective as two treatments of TrP manual therapy as a short-term  treatment of pain, disability, and ROM in patients with chronic mechanical neck pain, although TrP-DN  was more effective than TrP manual therapy in decreasing pressure pain thresholds over the cervical spine(35) -Based on an RCT with 94 patients conducted in Spain -Outcome measures were 11-point  numeric pain rating scale, cervical ROM, pressure point thresholds over C7 spinous process, and the Spanish version of the Northwick Park Neck Pain Questionnaire \u2013DN plus exercise was not found to be superior to sham DN plus exercise in an RCT conducted in Australia in patients with chronic whiplash-associated  disorders (WAD)(36) -Eighty patients with chronic WAD (> 3 months) received either 6 weeks of DN plus exercise or 6 weeks of sham DN plus exercise -Outcome measures were the Neck Disability Index (NDI) and self-rated  recovery at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks, and 6 and 12 months by blinded assessor -Although DN plus exercise was better than sham DN plus exercise at 6 and 12 months, the treatment effects were small and not clinically worthwhile \u2013TrP-DN  combined with traditional physical therapy is no more effective than traditional PT to improve shoulder ROM and upper extremity function following shoulder stabilization surgery(37) -Based on an RCT involving 39 patients conducted in the United States. Patients were randomized to either PT intervention or PT intervention+TrP-DN -No differences in groups were seen with ROM and pain subsets \u2013DN may improve pain (measured by V AS), spasticity, and motor function in patients who have had a stroke(18) -Based on a systematic review and meta-analysis  of 7 studies \u2013Deep dry needling (DDN) combined with stretching was more beneficial in treating nonspecific neck pain compared with stretching alone(43) -Based on an RCT study in Spain with 130 participants with nonspecific neck pain -Patients were randomized to either the DDN (n = 65) or stretching only group (n = 65) and treated 4x/week for 2 weeks -Pain intensity, neck ROM, neck muscle strength, and pain disability were measured at baseline, after 2 sessions, after intervention period, and at 15,30,90, and 180 days after intervention was completed -The authors found significant differences in all outcome measures (p < 0.001) and concluded that DDN combined with passive stretching is favorable to stretching alone",
            "Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) \u2013DN appears to be effective to relieve pain and tenderness of temporomandibular myofascial pain(22) -Based on a double-blind,  randomized, placebo-controlled  trial conducted in Turkey -A total of 52 subjects were randomized to receive DN or sham DN -Outcome measures included pressure algometry, V AS, and unassisted jaw opening without pain -Mean algometric values were significantly higher in the intervention group \u2013A multimodal physical therapy management approach that includes TrP-DN  may decrease pain disability and increase maximal mouth opening in TMJ dysfunction(23) -Based on a prospective case series conducted in Spain  -Multimodal treatment consisted of mobilization with movement of the TMJ and cervical spine, thoracic spine manipulation, and masseter muscle TrP-DN -Outcome measures included Temporomandibular disorder (TMD) Disability Questionnaire, V AS, and maximal mouth opening -Patients who received multimodal treatment exhibited significant and clinical improvements in pain intensity, disability, and mouth opening",
            "Knee \u2013Inclusion of DN to the vastus medialis and vastus lateralis muscle in a multimodal program (manual therapy and exercise) did not improve outcomes for patients with patellofemoral pain (PFP)(49) -Based on an RCT of 60 patients with PFP in Spain -Treatments were once a week for 3 weeks -Outcome measures were the pain subscale of the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS; 0\u2013100 scale), other subscales of the KOOS, the Knee Society Score, the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Evaluation Form (IKDC), and the numeric pain-rating  scale \u2013DN of lower limb MTrPs may prevent pain after total knee arthroplasty(24) -Based on a case series study conducted in Chile -For 4 weeks, 14 patients received DN to their lower extremity MTrPs from an experienced, trained PT once a week and participated in therapeutic exercise -The patients had improved walking speed, knee ROM, and pain levels following intervention",
            "Ankle and foot \u2013There is insufficient evidence to support the use of DN to improve symptoms in patients with ankle instability(28) \u2013There is insufficient evidence to support the use of TrP-DN to reduce plantar heel pain when compared to sham TrP-DN(38,39,40)",
            "Stroke \u2013DDN was effective at decreasing localized pressure sensitivity and improved shoulder ROM, but did not show any significant difference in decreasing muscle spasticity for patients with stroke(44) -Based on an RCT in Spain of 20 patients with stroke. Patients were randomized to receive rehabilitation only or rehabilitation combined with DDN. Needles were placed along the upper trapezius, infraspinatus, subscapularis, and pectoralis major of the spastic shoulder -Intervention was applied 1x/week for 3 weeks -Spasticity was measured using the Modified Ashworth Scale -Results of the study concluded that DDN combined with rehabilitation can increase pressure pain threshold and shoulder AROM, but there were no significant differences in spasticity",
            "Other applications \u2013Authors of a 2016 retrospective study (N = 44) found that the use of ultrasound-guided  dry needling (USGDN) on patients with chronic regional pain syndrome showed significant improvements in co-contraction  of the agonist/antagonist muscle of the shoulder, resulting in increases in the DASH outcome scores in all 44 patients. By improving co-contraction of the agonist and antagonist muscles, the shoulder is able to move in a smooth motion, decreasing any friction that may occur in the joint(s).Patients were objectively measured using the DASH during pretreatment (mean = 85.11), 15 days (26.26), and 45 days (15.73), resulting in > 50% improvement after 50 days and 75% improvement after 45 days(42) \u2013Authors of a 2016 systematic review found that DN can be effective at reducing pain in lower quarter trigger points, but did not affect overall function, QOL, depression, ROM, or strength(45) \u2013DN was found to be noninferior to cortisone injection in reducing lateral hip pain in patients with greater trochanter pain syndrome and could be considered an alternative treatment(50) -Based on an RCT conducted in the United States on 50 hips; measurements were taken over 6 weeks -Primary outcome measure was the numeric pain-rating scale \u2013DN was not found to increase extensibility of the hamstrings beyond stretching alone in patients with ROM deficits and no symptoms(51) -Based on an RCT conducted in the United States of 27 patients with limited hamstring extensibility \u2013One session of DN was shown to increase vertical jump in healthy young adults(52) -Based on a study of 35 students in the United States  -Intervention group received DN to four sites on bilateral gastrocnemius muscles:two on the medial head and two on the lateral head. Sham group had needle casing pressed to skin but no needle was inserted -The DN group significantly increased vertical jump height (1.2 inches) over the sham group when tested right after intervention",
