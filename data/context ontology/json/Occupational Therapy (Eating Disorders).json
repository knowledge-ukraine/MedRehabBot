            "An eating disorder is a condition that involves extreme emotions, attitudes, and behaviors regarding weight and food issues.(1) A person with an eating disorder experiences serious emotional and physical problems that can have life-threatening consequences.(1) The term eating disorders encompasses anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), binge eating disorder (BED; also called compulsive overeating), and eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS)(1)",
            "AN is a psychological eating disorder characterized by low body weight due to self-imposed  severe dietary restriction or other weight loss behaviors (e.g., excessive physical activity) motivate by an intense fear of weight gain and a distorted body image(1)",
            "BN is an eating disorder in which a person engages in a cycle of binge eating and subsequent purging. Individuals with BN often eat large amounts of food (more than most persons would consume in one meal) within a short period of time, and then eliminate the food and calories through vomiting, laxative abuse, or overexercising(1,3)",
            "BED is an eating disorder in which a person engages in uncontrolled, impulsive, or continuous eating beyond the point of feeling comfortably full; there is no purging; however, the person may take part in sporadic fasts or repeatedly diet(1)",
            "EDNOS: Other eating disorders can include a combination of the signs and symptoms of AN, BN, and/or BED.(4,5) While individuals with these disorders do not necessarily meet the criteria for another diagnosable eating disorder, these patterns of disordered eating can still result in significant physical and emotional problems(1,4,5)",
            "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition  (DSM-5 ) diagnostic criteria: \u2013AN -Restriction of energy intake relative to caloric requirements that leads to a significantly low body weight (i.e., less than minimally normal or minimally expected) given the person\u2019s age, sex, physical health, and developmental trajectory(31) -Intense fear of gaining weight or being fat despite a low body weight(31)  -Inability to recognize the seriousness of one\u2019s low body weight or evaluate one\u2019s own body weight or shape(31) -Subtypes: restricting type, binge-eating/purging type(31) -Severity(31) -Mild: BMI \u2265 17 kg/m2 -Moderate: BMI 16\u201316.99  kg/m2 -Severe: BMI 15\u201315.99  kg/m2 -Extreme: BMI < 15 kg/m2 \u2013BN -Recurrent episodes of binge eating(31) -Recurrent episodes of inappropriate behaviors intended to prevent weight gain (e.g., self-induced vomiting, misuse of laxatives)(31) -Binge eating and compensatory behaviors occur, on average, at least once every 3 weeks(31) -Evaluation of self is highly influenced by body shape/weight(31) -Episodes do not exclusively occur within episodes of AN(31) -Severity -Mild: Average of 1\u20133 inappropriate compensatory behaviors per week(31) -Moderate: Average of 4\u20137 inappropriate compensatory behaviors per week(31) -Severe: Average of 8\u201313  inappropriate compensatory behaviors per week(31) -Extreme: Average of 14+ inappropriate compensatory behaviors per week(31) \u2013BED -Recurrent episodes of binge eating associated with at least three of the following characteristics: -Eating much more rapidly than normal(31) -Eating until uncomfortably full(31) -Eating large amounts of food despite not feeling physically hungry(31) -Eating alone because one is embarrassed by how much is being eaten(31) -Feelings of disgust, depression, or guilt after eating(31) -Considerable distress is associated with binge eating(31) -A disorder is diagnosed if binge eating occurs on averageonce a week for 3 months(31) -Episodes are not associated with BN or do not occur exclusively during the course of BN(31) -Severity -Mild: 1\u20133 sessions of binge eating per week(31) -Moderate: 4\u20137 sessions of binge eating per week(31) -Severe: 8\u201313  sessions of binge eating per week(31) -Extreme: 14+ sessions of binge eating per week(31)",
            "Authors of a systematic review evaluated 94 studies conducted from 2000 to 2018 to determine the lifetime prevalence of eating disorders (studies were conducted in countries across North and South America, Europe, and Asia). They looked only at studies that included an accurate eating disorder diagnosis (based on DMV-5 diagnosis). They found the weight means (the weighted means were calculated from the prevalence data and the population size of each study) of lifetime eating disorders were 8.4% for women and 2.2% for men(36)"

Assisting patients in participating in purposeful-eating-related interventions may support the development of more adaptive behaviors and engagementin previously avoided occupations \u2013Authors of a study (N = 99) introduced practical food groups into the treatment inan eating disorder day program. The intervention involved eating-related  outings (e.g., eating in a restaurant) and meal preparation groups. Each session began with a 45-minute  discussion ofcoping mechanisms that could be used during the activities. The activity lasted 60 minutes and then was followed by a 45-minute  debriefing. The day program operated from 10 am to 4pm 4 days a week and the practical food group treatment took place once a week. The average treatment length in the program was 5 weeks(38) -Based on participant questionnaires, practical food groups were considered useful and valuable, yet challenging. Most patients reported increased confidence to try feared foods, decreased anxiety about food, and new, healthier ways of eating once they were discharged from the program -Practical food groups may be useful for patients recovering from eating disorders. However, further research is neededregarding their effect on helping to sustain patients\u2019 recovery from eating disorders",
            "Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)(1,13,15) \u2013CBT is a highly preferred treatment option for patients with eating disorders(42)  \u2013An OT can be trained and qualified to use CBT to aid in the rehabilitation of patients with eating disorders(13) \u2013In general, the underlying principle that guides CBT is that a person\u2019s thoughts and beliefs regarding a particular situation change the way in which the person acts in that situation(24,25) \u2013When a person expects failure or difficulty, failure or difficultly is more likely; when the person expects to succeed in a situation or activity, success is more likely(24) \u2013CBT for eating disorders aims to help patients identify situations that trigger their depressed moods and monitor negative thoughts, with the goal of preventing recurrence(3,23) -Involve the patient in the development of appropriate goals for therapy(3) -Teach the patient to self-monitor  behaviors such as food intake, frequency of binges/purges, and triggers related to bingeing and purging, as well as thoughts and emotions -Teach the patient to self-monitor  their weight weekly(3) -Educate the patient about the ineffectiveness of purging as a means of weight control as well as its harmful side effects(3) -Establish a reasonable weight goal and appropriate eating plan(3) -Assist with gradually introducing feared foods into the patient\u2019s diet(3) -Problem-solve  ways in which to cope with internal and external triggers that result in bingeing and purging(3) -Explore the patient\u2019s fear that he or she will lose control(3) -Determine a plan for relapse prevention(3) -Gradually facilitate the withdrawal of laxatives or diuretics(3) \u2013Specific treatment activities for CBT with this population include:(23) -food diaries -journaling -stress management training -assertiveness training -crafts -social skills training -relaxation training -education about and engagement in appropriate physical exercise -coping skills training for meal preparation -clothes shopping -eating a meal -money management -use of video equipment -education about eating disorders \u2013Authors of an RCT (N = 67) aimed to determine if an unguided internet CBT therapy for perfectionism could reduce eating disorder pathology, compulsive exercise, and burnout in patients who participate in regular exercise(39) -There is a link between perfectionism and eating disorders, compulsive exercise, and burnout -Patients in the intervention group received internet CBT therapy through weekly emails for 8 weeks on overcoming perfectionism -The control group, a waitlist control, did not receive any treatment during the 8 weeks -The unguided internet CBT therapy for perfectionism resulted in decreases in perfectionism, eating disorder symptomology, and compulsive exercise in patients who engage in regular exercise \u2013In a review of the literature on treatment for patients with co-occurring  BN and substance abuse, the authors concluded that CBT is a viable treatment option for these patients; however, modifications are required to appropriately address their specific needs (e.g., reduced motivation, difficulty with interpersonal relationships, impulsivity, reward sensitivity)(26)",
            "Physical activity \u2013There is evidence that physical activity is associated with decreased risk of depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders. Physical activity may protect against mental illnesses including eating disorders and be an effective intervention(40,41)  \u2013Physical activity has been excluded from many treatment guidelines for AN. Authors of a systematic review found that physical exercise programs may be appropriate and effective treatment for some patients with AN. They found that(40) -supervised physical exercise interventions were not associated with weight loss in patients with AN -physical exercise programs should focus on resistance/strength or flexibility -physical exercise programs did not influence anthropometry, but they may improve vital signs, muscle function and strength, and eating disorder symptomatology -exercise interventions should only be performed when they are safe for patients with AN -physical exercise programs should be supervised.They are most appropriate during the late phases of rehabilitation or stabilization of patients with AN -further research is needed to determine the frequency, type, and intensity of exercise that is most beneficial for patients with AN \u2013Authors of an RCT compared the effects of a physical exercise and dietary therapy (PED-t)  treatment to CBT in patients with either BN or BED. Both groups received 20 therapy sessions(42) -PED-t  group (N = 76):Patients received combined progressive resistance exercise training and high-intensity  interval running (45 minutes per session) with dietary therapy (60 minutes per session). Patients attended education sessions and participated in group discussion on behavioral and practical skills -CBT group (N = 73):Patients met1\u20132  times per weekfor 90-minute  sessions in which theydiscussed the four main stages of CBT for eating disorders:engagement and behavioral change, monitoring and evaluating progress, addressing the core ED pathology, and relapse prevention -Both treatment groups had significant improvements in symptoms of BN and BED, subjective well-being,  and psychosocial impairment. The PED-t  group had reduced symptoms of depression -PED-t  is equally effective as CBT for treatment of patients with BN and BED. It may be an alternative for certain patients who prefer it over CBT \u2013Resistance training -Authors of an RCT(N = 36) found that a high-intensity resistance training program that was adapted for adolescents was effective and safe for patients with AN and resulted in increased muscular strength and agility. All participants in the study were patients in the psychiatry/psychology unit of a pediatric hospital at the time of the study(30) -High-intensity  resistance training group: Patients participated in 3 sessions per week for 8 weeks in the hospital gym and were given increased protein in their daily diet. Each intervention session was 50 to 60 minutes in length and consisted of a warm-up,  resistance training, and cool-down.  The resistance training involved three sets of 8\u201310 repetitions on weight-lifting machines; the load started at 70% of 6-repetition maximum (RM) and was gradually progressed 5% to 10% at a time as the patient\u2019s strength increased -Control group: Patients had psychological therapy and the same medical treatment as the high-intensity  resistance training group except for the exercise portion and increased protein intake -At the conclusion of the study, patients in the high-intensity  resistance exercise group had significantly greater upper and lower body strength than those in the control group. Improvements were observed on the TUG 3-minute  and 10-minute  tests and the Timed Up and Down Stairs (TUDS); however, these were not statistically significant. The authors noted that during treatment the patients in the intervention group did not decrease in weight or BMI despite the exercise training",
            "Group therapy(12,15,23) \u2013Group therapy can center on IADLs such as cooking or shopping(12) \u2013Sometimes provided in the form of family therapy in which the goal of therapy is to help the family reframe the view of thinness as an ideal and to solve any underlying family issues that contribute to the patient\u2019s maladaptive behaviors(23) -The therapist facilitating family therapy is most often a psychologist or family counselor; however, the OT can be present and often offer helpful insight(23)",
