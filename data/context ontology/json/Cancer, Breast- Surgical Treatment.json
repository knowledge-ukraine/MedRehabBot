            "Breast cancer is a malignant disease of the breast tissues that occurs almost exclusively in women\u2014males account for only 1% of cases.(5) It is the most common cancer in women worldwide and is second to lung cancer as the leading cause of cancer death in women(3)",
            "Types of breast cancer \u2013In situ (non-metastasizing  tumors) -Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) \u2013 noninfiltrating (noninvasive) carcinoma(1,7) -Proliferation of malignant-appearing  mammary duct epithelial cells without evidence of invasion beyond the basement membrane -15% to 30% of cancers detected in mammography screening are DCIS -DCIS can present as a palpable or nonpalpable mass, or more commonly as calcifications detected on mammogram -A problem in the management of DCIS is that it is not possible to determine which DCIS will progress to invasive carcinoma during a woman\u2019s lifetime -Several classification schemes for DCIS have been developed, but none has been found satisfactory for predicting invasive carcinoma -Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) \u2013 noninfiltrating carcinoma(7) -An alteration of lobular cytology, sometimes included with similar but less well-developed lesions as atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH) -Historically LCIS has been thought to be a precursor lesion of invasive cancer and so treatment with mastectomy typically is recommended -Incidence of subsequent invasive lobular carcinoma is substantially increased compared with women without LCIS; however, the subsequent cancers are more often invasive ductal carcinoma than invasive lobular carcinoma \u2013Invasive (infiltrating) breast cancers \u2013 classification is based on the growth pattern and cytological features of the invasive tumor cells. WHO\u2019s classification system recognizes invasive ductal and lobular carcinomas; however, this does not mean that one arises from ducts and the other from lobules, as most invasive breast cancers originate in the terminal duct-lobule  unit(7) -Invasive ductal carcinoma \u2013 the most common (histologically) type of breast cancer \u201370\u201380%  of patients with breast cancer have this type(7) -This is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning that none of the other special categories of invasive tumor cells (examples listed below) applies -Invasive lobular carcinoma \u2013 ~10% of patients with breast cancer have this type(7) -Invasive medullary carcinoma(7)  -Invasive tubular carcinoma(7) -Invasive mucinous carcinoma(7) \u2013Locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) and inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) \u2013 make up 2\u20135%  of all breast cancers(7) -IBC is an aggressive variant of LABC, characterized by diffuse erythema and edema, often without a discrete mass",
            "Surgical treatment of breast cancer \u2013Breast-conserving  surgery \u2013 has been shown, in several large randomized clinical trials, to result in survival rates similar to those for patients who undergo modified radical mastectomy(3) -Lumpectomy \u2013 surgeon excises tumor and minimal healthy tissue surrounding lesion; may also include a lymph node dissection(1) -Partial mastectomy or segmental mastectomy \u2013 portion of the breast is removed that encompasses cancerous tissue as well as margin of typical tissue surrounding cancerous area; may also include a lymph node dissection(1) -Quadrantectomy \u2013 type of partial mastectomy; excision of the tumor and surrounding breast tissue to provide an adequate surgical margin from cancer cells with axillary dissection(2) \u2013Total mastectomy (or complete or simple mastectomy)\u2013  entire breast is surgically removed; may also include a lymph node dissection(1) \u2013Modified radical mastectomy \u2013 entire breast is surgically removed along with numerous lymph nodes in axilla, fascia over pectoralis muscles, and at times a portion of pectoralis muscles(1) \u2013Radical mastectomy or Halsted radical mastectomy \u2013 similar to a radical mastectomy but encompasses all of the lymph nodes in the axilla and entire pectoralis muscle(1) \u2013Skin-sparing  mastectomy \u2013 currently the treatment of choice in most medical centers for loco-regional  control of large or multifocal tumors.(#) Involves total resection of the breast gland with removal of an ellipse of skin incorporating the nipple-areolar  complex \u2013Nipple-sparing  mastectomy (NSM) as a therapeutic or prophylactic procedure is gaining popularity(#) -Authors of a retrospective chart review on patients undergoing NSM or skin-sparing  mastectomy in the United States from 2005 to 2011 indicate that NSM does not increase the risk of recurrence or decrease survival(10) -One hundred thirty patients who underwent an NSM and 131 patients who underwent a skin-sparing mastectomy for either breast cancer or prophylaxis were included -There was no difference in survival or cancer recurrence between the groups \u2013Breast reconstruction -Patient may undergo the procedure during mastectomy or at a later date(1) -Reconstruction may involve implantation of a prosthesis or muscle and/or fat tissue from another part of the patient\u2019s body (autologous reconstruction) to supplement the breast tissue removed during the mastectomy(3) -Examples of tissues used during breast reconstructions include the TRAM (transversus abdominis myocutaneous) flap, the latissimus, the gluteus maximus, and the gracilis(3) -The two-stage  tissue expander/implant reconstruction is currently the gold standard for implant-based immediate breast reconstruction -Reconstruction may require several surgeries done over a period of months to as long as 1 year",

            "Clinical practice guidelines have been formulated by the American Physical Therapy Association for breast-cancer-related lymphedema(17) \u2013Early postoperative care -Resumption of activity should be coordinated with the interdisciplinary care team. Individualized exercise activity can be increased as patient tolerated, while monitoring for any adverse effects -Compression garments should be fitted for patients with a high risk of developing lymphedema. Upper extremity exercises in combination with diaphragmatic breathing may help reduce lymphedema \u2013Exercise for individuals with an International Society of Lymphology (ISL) score of 0 (Subclinical Phase) -For those who are in the subclinical phase of lymphedema -Subclinical is defined as disease that is not considered severe enough or presenting with any observable symptoms -Progressive resistance training exercises are considered safe and should be initiated no later than 1-month  postsurgery -An individualized aerobic exercise program should be performed -Assess exercise tolerance and capacity weekly and monitor for adverse effects \u2013Interventions recommended for those with ISL Stage I (Early Lymphedema) -Patients should be properly fitted with a compression garment. Exercise should be individually tailored \u2013Interventions for individuals with breast-cancer-related lymphedema -If early signs of lymphedema are present, patients should be properly fitted for a compression garment and given an appropriate exercise program \u2013For moderate to late stages of lymphedema (ISL stages II and III) -Stage II is defined as moderate lymphedema -Stage III is defined as having late stages of lymphedema -Compression bandages and exercises should be performed -Kinesiology tape can be applied but should not replace compression garments. Observe for any adverse effects associated with kinesiology tape application",
            "Self-performed  manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) should be initiated once an appropriate stable volume reduction is achieved in the upper extremity. Continue using compression garment and exercise as appropriate",
            "Complete decongestive physical therapy (CDT) \u2013Considered the gold standard for lymphedema management. CDT can be divided into 2 phases -Phase I \u2013 decrease swelling in the limb to its normal size as much as possible while maintaining healthy skin tissue. Has 4 components -Manual lymph drainage (MLD) -Compression therapy -Exercise -Skin care -Phase II \u2013 goal is to preserve the results from phase I. Has 4 components -MLD -Compression therapy -Exercise -Skin care \u2013The overall goal is to improve drainage of the obstructed areas by pushing the fluids to unobstructed areas(4) \u2013Complete decongestive therapy (CDT) combined with a home exercise program resulted in significant improvements in the DASH questionnaire and a reduction in pain compared to a conventional physical therapy program(11) -Based on an RCT conducted in Saudi Arabia -The study included 60 postmastectomy patients randomized to either the CDT with home exercise group or conventional physical therapy group  -Patients in the CDT group received MLD, performed remedial exercises, donned a compression garment for 23 hours, and participated in a home exercise program -Patients in the conventional physical therapy group received MLD, donned a low-elastic  compression garment, received glenohumeral mobilization to the affected extremity, and performed deep-breathing exercises -Both groups received therapy 5x/week for 6 weeks",

            "Focal muscle vibration therapy \u2013Focal muscle vibration therapy can be a useful tool in improving upper limb function in patients after mastectomy(12) -Fourteen patients were included in the study -Outcome measures used in this study included the DASH questionnaire, Body Image Scale, McGill Pain Questionnaire, and Constant-Murley  Scale -Vibration stimulation was applied to the muscles of the affected extremity using an electromechanical transducer, a mechanical support, and an electronic control system. The transducer was applied perpendicularly to the muscle near the distal tendon insertion. Transducer produced forces ranging between 7 and 9 N with a frequency of 100 Hz -Patients receiving treatment were asked to perform an isometric contraction of the muscle being treated. Intervention was applied for 3 consecutive days for a duration of 10 minutes for 3 sessions each day -Authors of this study found that individuals undergoing focal muscle vibration therapy showed significant improvements in disability scores as measured by the DASH questionnaire, reduction of pain, and improvement in upper limb function",
