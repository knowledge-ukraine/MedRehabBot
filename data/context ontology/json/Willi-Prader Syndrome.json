Motor milestones and language development are delayed.(1)Behavioral/emotional disorders associated with PWS (e.g., temper tantrums, maladaptive behavior, stubbornness, obsessive-compulsive  disorder) represent a distinct phenotype.(1) Other characteristics include sleep disturbances, short stature and delayed bone growth, scoliosis, eye/visual problems, skin picking, thick saliva, and diabetes mellitus, type 2 (DM2)(1,35) or application of equipment .

            "PWS is the most common cause of life-threatening  obesity in children.(23) Diet and food restriction are part of the long-term  management of PWS \u2013Nutritional supplements should be considered when a restricted-calorie  diet is used",
            "Scoliosis: May be treated with serial cast correction or surgically(17) \u2013Authors of a U.S.-based  study of 23 patients concluded that both serial cast correction and surgery are effective in treating early-onset  scoliosis in patients with PWS(17)",
            "GH therapy: Use of GH is associated with improved physical condition, metabolic function, and cognitive performance in PWS \u2013Aims of GH treatment in PWS are increasing final height, improving body composition, increasing exercise capacity, and reducing the risk of developing obesity. GH treatment is associated with improved lean body mass, increased physical activity level, and increased muscle bulk. In addition, GH treatment is associated with improved developmental and cognitive motor skill acquisition(22) \u2013Researchers in the Netherlands reported that GH increased muscle thickness, which was related to muscle strength and motor development in infants with PWS(26) -Based on an RCT involving 22 infants who were followed over 2 years -Muscle thickness was measured using ultrasound scans -Catch-up  growth in muscle thickness was faster in muscles that are most frequently used in early development. This was independent of GH and suggests a training effect",
