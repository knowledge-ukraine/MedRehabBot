            "A modified barium swallow study (MBSS) is a recorded (either on videotape or digital media) fluoroscopic examination of a patient\u2019s swallowing function performed by a speech-language  pathologist (SLP) in conjunction with a radiologist during which a patient is asked to swallow varying amounts of barium mixtures.(1,2) The MBSS is used to identify oropharyngeal dysphagia as well as the patient\u2019s risk for aspiration.(1,2) Additionally, the SLP might utilize the MBSS to determine and to teach appropriate compensatory strategies and/or therapeutic exercises for a patient with dysphagia(1,2)",
