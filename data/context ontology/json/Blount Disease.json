Children with earlyonset  Blount disease had a skeletal age that was advanced by 10 months and significantly advanced by 26 months compared to children with lateonset  Blount disease By taking skeletal age into account, orthopedic surgeons can reduce the risk of suboptimal surgical outcomes, including persistent valgus overcorrection after proximal tibial osteotomy and undercorrection after guided growth treatment Results of corrective surgery are best if performed by 4 years of age(2) In early cases, surgical correction may cause reversal of radiographic findings However, once physeal bridging occurs, there is no alternative to repeated surgical correction of angular deformity and leglength  inequality until growth ceases at skeletal maturity In addition to proximal tibial metaphyseal osteotomy with either acute or gradual correction, several other realignment strategies are available for very specific conditions(1) High tibial osteotomy of the tibia with concomitant osteotomy of the fibula is considered the \u201cgold standard\u201d to manage infantile Blount disease(16) Other procedures used are lateral hemiepiphysiodesis and guided growth around the knee, distal femoral osteotomy, elevation of the medial tibial plateau, resection of a physeal osseous bar, and gradual asymmetrical proximal tibialphysealdistraction(1) Occasionally, two or more of these operative procedures are applied simultaneously or in a staged manner Various surgical techniques include transverse, domed, and angled osteotomies, but in all cases the limb should be overcorrected into valgus to minimize the risk of recurrence. Internal tibial torsion should also be correctedfull to overcorrection of varus, flexion, and internal rotational deformities of the tibia(10) Postoperative management varies from simple casting to external fixation depending on the surgeon(16) It is important to keep in mind that patients with infantile Blountdisease may also have meniscal tears or other degenerative changes, even in the presence of corrected deformity (16)  For severe deformities and for patients with closed physes in adolescent Blountdisease, a valgus-producing  proximal tibial osteotomy with internal fixation is the most commonly used approach. An alternative approach with external fixation using a circular or multiaxial frame can be used to achieve gradual correction of the deformity and to minimize the risk of neurovascular complications from an acute correction(16)",
