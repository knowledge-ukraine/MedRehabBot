            "General considerations \u2013Cooling the extremities generally increases systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure as well as oxygen saturation, while also decreasing core body temperatures and pulse rate(30)  \u2013Authors of a study in the United Kingdom of the cooling efficiency of different cryotherapeutic agents found that crushed ice and ice-water  immersion provided significantly greater cooling efficiency than gel packs and frozen peas(3) -A repeated measures design was used -Skin surface temperature of the ankle was measured after a 20-minute cryotherapy application -The crushed ice and ice-water  immersion had the greatest cooling efficiency and sustained decreased surface temperature post application -Twenty-minute  applications caused skin surface temperature to fall within the therapeutic temperature range -Further research is needed to investigate depth of cooling and the relationship between deeper tissue temperature and skin temperature \u2013The cooling effectiveness of different types of ice used in ice packs was evaluated in a repeated measures study conducted in the United States(4) -Ice packs were made of polyethylene bags filled with cubed ice, crushed ice, or cubed ice plus water (\u201cwetted ice\u201d) -Cutaneous and intramuscular temperature was measured -Wetted ice was more effective than cubed ice and crushed ice in lowering surface temperature during treatment and maintaining the lower temperature during recovery -Wetted ice and cubed ice were more effective than crushed ice in lowering intramuscular temperature and maintaining the lower temperature \u2013Although the wetted ice bag is currently the clinical gold standard for decreasing intramuscular temperature, researchers in the United States reported in 2016 that salted cubed ice bags were as effective as wetted bags at decreasing intramuscular temperature at 2 cm subadipose, and suggested that salted ice bags may be more clinically practical(19) -Based on a repeated measures study that involved 24 healthy participants -Ice bags made of wetted ice (2,000mL ice and 300 mL water), salted crushed ice, and salted cubed ice were applied to the posterior gastrocnemius for 30 minutes -The presence of water in the ice bags provides better contact with the skin -When salt is applied to ice, the ice begins to melt and the substance\u2019s freezing point is lowered, with the resulting water staying in liquid form at lower than freezing temperatures -Cutaneous and intramuscular temperatures of nondominant gastrocnemius were measured at baseline, immediately after treatment, and during a 45-minute rewarming period",
            "Acute soft tissue injury: Cryotherapy is widely practiced in the treatment of acute soft tissue injuries; however, there is insufficient evidence that it improves the clinical outcomes of soft tissue injury \u2013Therapeutic benefits of cryotherapy are enhanced by simultaneous application of compression(38) -Cryocompression enhances the recovery and performance after performing a heavy resistance exercise workout",
            "Exercise-induced  muscle damage: Cryotherapy is a commonly used treatment believed to reduce symptoms of exercise-induced  muscle damage. Results of studies evaluating the effects of cryotherapy are conflicting, and protocols vary \u2013Authors of a 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis  found that the available evidence suggests that cold-water immersion can be slightly better than passive recovery in the management of muscle soreness, and that there is a dose-response relationship(20) -Nine RCTs that compared cold-water  immersion to passive recovery were included -Meta-analysis  indicated that cold-water  immersion is more effective than passive recovery in terms of immediate and delayed effects -Water temperature between 11 and 15\u00b0C for 11\u201315  minutes provides the best results for both immediate and delayed effects \u2013Researchers in Japan found that regular post-exercise  cold applications to muscles might attenuate muscular and vascular adaptations to resistance training(21) -Fourteen subjects performed wrist-flexion  resistance training for 6 weeks -Training included 5 sets of 8 wrist flexion exercises at 70\u201380% repetition max, 3 times per week -Seven participants immersed their experimental forearms in cold water (10\u00b0C) for 20 minutes after the exercises, and 7 did not -Measurements taken before and after the training period included wrist flexor thickness, brachial diameter, maximal muscle strength, and local muscle endurance  -Wrist flexor thickness of the experimental arms increased in both groups, but the increase was significantly less in the cooled group compared to the noncooled group -Maximal muscle strength and brachial artery diameter did not increase in the cooled group, but did increase in the noncooled group -Local muscle endurance increased in both groups, but the increase was lower in the cooled group than the noncooled group",
            "Postoperative \u2013The efficacy and safety of using cryotherapy devices in the postoperative setting were evaluated in a small study conducted in the United States of healthy individuals(7) -Three different cryotherapy devices were applied over different amounts of layering -Skin temperature was recorded every 15 minutes for 180 minutes -Safe and effective temperature range was achieved with all devices when applied over one layer of Jones compression dressing -Effective temperature range was not achieved over two layers of Jones compression dressing -Efficacy and safety were less predictable when devices were applied over thinner, standard surgical dressings \u2013Researchers in the United States also found that short-term  application of cryotherapy post total knee arthroplasty (TKA) did not significantly decrease pain nor did it improve patient satisfaction with pain management(22) -Based on an RCT with crossover that involved 29 patients post TKA -Two sequential episodes of pain requiring analgesic administration were studied in each patient, one with a 30-minute cryotherapy application and one without, in random order -The benefit of short-term  cryotherapy for pain relief post TKA was found to be questionable \u2013In a single-blinded  RCT, researchers in China found cryotherapy to be effective in relieving pain and reducing analgesic consumption for patients post elbow arthrolysis(23) -Fifty-nine  patients who received elbow arthrolysis were randomly assigned to a cryotherapy plus standard care group or to a control group receiving standard care only -V AS scores were significantly lower in the cryotherapy group during the first 7 postoperative days, both at rest and in motion",
            "Authors of an RCT conducted in the United States found that application of cryoneurolysis can be an effective treatment option in reducing pain and improving symptoms in patients with knee pain due to osteoarthritis(28) \u2013One hundred eighty patients participated in this study, with 121 individuals being placed in the experimental group and 59 in the control group \u2013Cryoneurolysis was applied to the inferior branch of the saphenous nerve (IPBSN) for 30 days while the control group received a sham treatment \u2013Results after 30 days showed significant improvements in the Western Ontario McMaster Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) compared to the sham group. Results were effective for at least 150 days after treatment",
            "Muscle function: The analgesic effect of cryotherapy allows a patient to perform therapeutic exercises that would otherwise be painful. Evidence suggests that the beneficial effects of cryokinetics (the use of cryotherapy in conjunction with exercise) might be partially due to disinhibition of the musculature surrounding the injured joint \u2013Authors of a study conducted in Italy suggest that use of partial body cryotherapy (PBC) before a training session or sport competition can increase isometric strength of the hand(26) -Two hundred healthy adults were randomized to either the PBC group (n = 100) or control group (n = 100). Prior to the experiment, hand grip strength was taken -Individuals in the experimental group performed 150-second  sessions of PBC with temperatures ranging between \u2013130\u00b0 C and \u2013160\u00b0  C -The control group stayed in a neutral temperature room ranging from 22.0 \u00b1 0.5\u00b0 C -Immediately after the session, the handgrip strength of participants in both groups was retested. After a single session of PBC there were significant improvements in handgrip strength in the experimental group compared to the control group",
            "Muscle tone: Use of cryotherapy to reduce tone in spastic muscles is sometimes recommended for patients with neurological disorders such as stroke or traumatic brain injury",
            "Endurance performance/exercise-induced  hyperthermia: Cold-water  immersion has also been investigated as a cooling intervention before physical activity (i.e., precooling)  \u2013Authors of a 2015 meta-analysis  investigating the optimal procedures for cold-water  immersion for exertional heat stroke concluded that prompt, vigorous cold-water  immersion should be encouraged for treating exercise-induced hyperthermia whenever possible, using cold-water  temperature of approximately 10\u00b0C and maximizing body surface contact (whole-body  immersion)(24) -Nineteen studies were included -Results demonstrated that cold-water  immersion had a significant effect. Cold-water  immersion cooled individuals twice as fast as passive recovery -Immersion duration of 10 minutes, immersing torso and limbs, was most effective. There is insufficient evidence of effectiveness of immersing just forearms and hands for rapid cooling \u2013A combination of internal and external body-cooling  techniques might enhance repeated athletic performance in heat more than individual cooling methods do(12) -Based on an RCT conducted in Australia -Twelve repeated sprint cyclists were randomized to 1 of 4 experimental conditions: a cooling jacket, ingestion of an ice slushy, combination of cooling jacket and ice slushy, or control -All of the cooling techniques improved performance in comparison to the controls. In comparison to the individual cooling techniques, enhancement of sprint performance was greater with the combination of internal and external body cooling techniques",
