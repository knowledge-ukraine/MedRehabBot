Some surgeons prefer protected weight-bearing in a walking boot over cast immobilization for athletes because it allows immediate ROM and pool therapy after wound healing(13) \u2013Authors of a 2013 systematic review of 26 studies on treatment of Jones fractures found that return to sport and functional outcome data were not clearly documented in many cases(15) -Return to sports following surgical fixation ranged from 4 to 18 weeks \u2013In general, physical therapy is focused on facilitating mobility and improving functional outcomes such as return to sport(6,7) -Initial rehabilitation should involve protection, rest, ice, compression, elevation (PRICE) approach to control pain and swelling -Active and passive ROM exercises -Progressive unassisted weight-bearing  without walking boot -Aerobic and strengthening exercises (e.g., treadmill, stair-stepper)  once weaned from walking boot -Gentle manual mobilization of forefoot to reduce any residual pain that may accompany stiffness -Functional training such as gait reeducation and specific conditioning for sport (running and jumping, as indicated) or occupational demands -Electrotherapeutic modalities, as indicated. Studies are lacking on the effectiveness of electrotherapeutic modalities for treating Jones fracture -Bone stimulator (can be applied outside the cast and used daily) \u2013Patient education regarding appropriate/protective footwear \u2013In a case study of an 18-year-old  collegiate basketball player with a nondisplaced Jones fracture, patient was presented with surgical and nonsurgical options and opted for nonsurgical management(19) -Thirteen weeks of conservative management included therapy and home exercise program -Weeks 2\u20133 primarily consisted of promoting healing and minimizing pain and performing pain-free  ankle ROM -Weeks 4\u20135 continued to promote healing and integrate weight-bearing  and ambulation. Exercises included concentric and eccentric exercises against manual resistance -Weeks 6\u20137 focused on improving muscle performance, continuing to work on ankle mobility and strength, and other lower extremity exercises. Sport-specific  training included stationary dribbling and static shooting (no jumping) -Weeks 8\u20139 continued to focus on strength and healing. Incorporated some running drills -Weeks 10\u201314  focused on maximizing strength and function and return to full sport participation -Patient was able to participate with full sport activities after 13 weeks and was able to complete the basketball season without pain \u2013Authors of a retrospective study (N = 1,311 National Football League players participating from 2012 to 2015) found that 40 (3.1%) had returned to play after screw fixation for Jones fracture. There was no statistically significant \u201crisk\u201d of these players failing to be drafted, or playing in or starting fewer NFL games as compared to players without a history of repair for Jones fracture(24) . Problem Goal Intervention Expected Progression Home Program  Foot pain; tender and swollen tissuesResolve pain and inflammation of soft tissuesPhysical agents and electrotherapeutic modalities _ Implement cryotherapeutic agents and the PRICE approach for pain managementAllow at least 6 weeks for fracture healing in type I fracture. Additional time may be necessary for complete resolution of tendernessProvide patient with instructions for the PRICE approach to control pain and swelling. Minimize outer loading of the foot during rehabilitation(25) Joint stiffness, decreased intrinsic foot muscle flexibility and joint ROM after castingRestore normal mobility of fifth MT joint and foot muscle flexibilityManual therapy _ Passive accessory mobilization without manipulation, as indicatedProgress to passive ROM and stretchingProvide patient with simple ROM and stretching exercises to complete at home Reduced foot strength and enduranceRestore or improve physical fitness for return to full activitiesTherapeutic modalities _ ROM and strengthening exercises as indicated. Modes of training that match patient\u2019s upper- body ability (e.g., arm cycling, weight lifting) to help maintain fitness during fracture healing period _ Hydrotherapy: pool- based therapy(17) emphasizing cardiovascular conditioning _ Aquajogger: walking, jogging, sprinting and strengthening exercises during weight-bearing restriction period _ Lower-extremity resistance training can begin after fracture healing and painless active ROM is restored. Manual and assisted foot stretching exercises to regain full passive ROM at ankle, subtalar, and toe jointsGradually progress intensity of exercises before full weight- bearing; therapeutic exercises 3x per week for 4 weeks. The intensity and duration of exercises should be progressed in the final phase to restore fitness for work and sportProvide patient with simple strengthening exercises. Daily repetition of exercises  Abnormal standing posture, nonsymmetrical or antalgic weight-bearing and gait; increased risk of fallsRestoration of symmetry in standing posture and weight- bearing activities; normal gait mechanicsFunctional training _ Posture and gait reeducation. Sitting balance ball exercises and/or pool therapy for partial weight-bearing. Standing balance exercises, full weight- bearing activitiesProgress weight- bearing as tolerated. Gradual progression of exercises to allow additional weight- bearing. Increase speed and complexity of movementsProvide patient and family/caregivers with written instructions regarding functional activities that can be performed at home Functional decline in performance of affected leg: reduced balance, walking ability, stair climbing; increased risk of fallsImprove functional balance and walking endurance, with independence in fall prevention strategiesFunctional training _ Implement proprioception training tools as indicated and when appropriate: pillow, foam pad, BAPS, wobble diskProgress weight- bearing as tolerated. Gradual progression of exercises to allow additional weight- bearing. Increase speed and complexity of movementsProvide patient and family/caregivers with written instructions regarding functional activities that can be performed at home Non- or partial weight- bearing. Use of ambulatory assistive device. Improper athletic footwearProtect healing tissues and prevent reinjuryPrescription, application of devices and equipment _ Assistive devices and orthotics, as indicated. Shoe modifications may help support/ protect affected tissues. Custom in- shoe foot orthoses are recommended for athletes(13)Wean from ambulatory assistive devices as appropriateCorrect use of assistive devices and/or application of equipment.
