            "Bariatric (weight loss) surgery is a common intervention for treatment of adults with morbid obesity, defined as body mass index (BMI) of at least 40 kg/m2,and for obese patients with severe comorbid conditions such as type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, heart disease, or osteoarthritis (22)",
            "Authors of a 2014 Cochrane systematic review (22 randomized controlled trials [RCTs] with 1798 participants)concluded that bariatric surgery \u201cresults in greater improvement in weight loss outcomes and weight associated comorbidities compared with non-surgical  interventions, regardless of the type of procedures used\u201d (23)",
            "Bariatric surgical options can be broadly divided into procedures that restrict stomach volume and those that cause malabsorption of ingested nutrients(1)",
            "The adjustable gastric band and theRoux-en-Y  gastric bypass (RYGP) options are the most common procedures around the world.(2) The vertical sleeve gastrectomy procedure is also commonly used (1,22) \u2013Gastric band \u2013 a silicon band is placed around the stomach approximately 1 cm inferior to the gastroesophageal juncture, resulting in a gastric pouch above the band. The band can be incrementally inflated via injection of saline to achieve adequate restriction of stomach volume \u2013RYGP \u2013 the stomach is bisected and a small pouch is made. The jejunum (proximal part of the small intestine) is divided below the pyloric sphincter and the distal segment is anastomosed to the gastric pouch. The remainder of the stomach and proximal part of the jejunum are anastomosed back to the small intestine, but these tissues are prevented from direct contact with ingested food \u2013Vertical sleeve gastrectomy \u2013 75-80%  of the stomach volume is resected by being stapled off, leaving a \u201cgastric tunnel\u201d",
            "Gastric banding and sleeve gastrectomy are restrictive procedures (decrease size of stomach reservoir thereby limiting food intake)",
            "RYGB has a restrictive and a malabsorptive component. Only a small gastric pouch remains, and the segment of the small intestine that is bypassed is where bile and pancreatic enzymes would usually mix with food passing through the stomach to facilitate nutrient absorption",
            "Bariatric surgery is effective for weight loss in the majority of patients. Following RYGB patients lost an estimated 65 to 70% of their excess body weight within the first 2 years following surgery(3) ",
            "Patients are limited in their food intake following bariatric surgery and the calorie restriction facilitates weight loss",
            ".Although research indicates that bariatric surgery is more effective for treating obesity than diet and exercise,increasing physical activityafter the surgery is an important intervention for maximizing weight loss and preventing weight regain(4,22) \u2013Physical activity counseling and supervised exercise trainingafter bariatric surgery not only promote greater weight control, but may also improve body composition and deficits in physical functioning (5,24)"

            "Criteria for potential surgical candidates typically also include the following: \u2013Weight loss history -Failure of previous nonsurgical attempts at weight loss, including commercial programs (e.g., Weight Watchers International Inc., Jenny Craig)(6) -Documented failure to keep weight off or prevent further weight gain using aggressive medical management that included behavioral, pharmacologic, exercise, and low-calorie  diet components (9) \u2013Commitment -Expectation that patient will adhere to postoperative care, including follow up visits, dietary recommendations, and physical activity (9) \u2013Nonpregnant woman; absence of chronic disease unrelated to obesity(7)"
