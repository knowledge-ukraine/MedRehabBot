The type and intensity of exercise must be determined based on patient-specific  factors (e.g., pain, level of joint pathology). Both resistive and aerobic exercise are safe \u2013There was strong evidence to support patient education on joint protection. The authors recommend that clinicians document the method of delivery of the education and that additional research into the efficacy of specific programs is warranted \u2013There was some evidence to support the use of splints during flare-ups  to decrease pain and for increasing grip strength; however, the authors suggest that additional research is needed to further support the efficacy of splinting (e.g., type of splint, wearing schedules, patient compliance) and that clinicians should clearly document the goals for splinting using measurable outcomes",

all exercise programs must be specifically tailored to the needs of a given patient(4) -Exercise programs for patients with RA should avoid unnecessary joint stress, pain, and joint swelling and should work within the patient\u2019s comfortable ROM(4) -Train the patient to perform each exercise slowly, smoothly, and with proper technique; additionally, educate the patient on the rationale for each specific exercise(4) -Strengthening upper and lower extremities with resistance (isometric or isotonic) as indicated by physician order; not appropriate for acute phase(4) -Discontinue any resistance exercise if the patient reports pain, the exercise creates deforming forces, or the exercise compromises joint stability(4)  -Grip-strengthening  exercises can be performed with light resistance putty for the joints in the hand(4) -Active or passive stretching can be incorporated to increase joint mobility; not appropriate for acute phase(4) -Specific hand ROM exercises utilized for patients with RA -Forearms/wrists(4) -With elbows partially bent and kept down toward the side of the body, turn the palms up and down -Lift the hands backward, allowing the fingers to curl, then bend the hands down, allowing the fingers to straighten -Fingers(4) -Instruct the patient to make a fist, then open the hands and straighten the fingers -Touch the thumb tips to the tip of each finger -With the palms on the thigh or against a table, move the thumbs away from the fingers and slide each finger toward the thumb \u2013ADLs/IADLs(3,4) -Introduce assistive and/or adaptive equipment to increase safety and independence with ADLs/IADLs(4,22) -Incorporate frequent rest breaks into ADLs/IADLs(22) -Gradually increase the demands placed on the patient for ADLs/IADLs(4,22) -In general, patients with RA should not engage in activities that require the hand to be in a static position for a prolonged period of time(4) \u2013Orthosis fabrication (i.e., splinting)(1,3,4) -Indicated for reducing inflammation, decreasing pain, supporting unstable joints, limiting undesirable joint motion, increasing ROM, and properly positioning joints(4) -A resting hand orthosis is very common in the treatment of RA(4) -Orthosis fabrication can be utilized appropriately in all phases and stages of RA(4) -Stage I (early): resting orthoses for decreased inflammation and pain as well as joint protection(4) -Stage II (moderate): day orthoses to provide comfort; night orthoses to relieve pain and/or protect joints against deformity; splints created to increase ROM(4) -Stage III (severe): day orthoses to promote increased function; night orthoses for positioning and comfort(4) -Stage IV (terminal): day orthoses to promote increased function; night orthoses for positioning and comfort(4) -Special considerations for use of orthoses in patients with RA include: -The added weight of the orthosis can put additional stress on the upper extremity, resulting in pain and fatigue; ensure that the orthosis is as lightweight as possible(4) -Forces are transferred from the splinted to adjacent, unsplinted joints, which can cause these joints to become more symptomatic(4) -Skin tolerance can be problematic because of the increased risk of fragile skin in patients with RA(4) -Patients with sensory impairments will need close monitoring when using an orthosis to identify signs of pressure(4) -Modify straps as needed to allow for increased ease and decreased joint stress when donning and doffing(4) -The authors of a study designed to assess the functional impact of a wrist splint inpatients with RA found improvements in manual dexterity for both light and heavy activities (23) -Examples of orthoses -Resting hand orthosis(4,24) -Indications: rest during acute flares -Considerations: immobilizes the entire hand; typically worn while asleep and majority of waking hours; should be taken off for hygiene/ROM -Although the benefits of resting hand orthoses are well-established,  studies have shown that patient compliance is only about 50%(4) -Wrist orthoses (e.g., cock-up  wrist orthosis) (4,24) -Indications: minimize pain  -Considerations: 10\u00b0 to 15\u00b0 of wrist extension to facilitate use of the hand (fingers are not immobilized); can be helpful to stabilize the wrist during heavier activities such as ironing, gardening, or housework(24) -Metacarpophalangeal ulnar deviation orthosis(4,24) -Indications: to align and support joints for functional tasks in an effort to minimize pain -Considerations: can restrict/interfere with hand use and ability to perceive sensory input; therapist needs to set wearing schedule -Swan-neck  orthosis(4,24) -Also known as a PIP hyperextension blocking splint; providesthree points of pressure to reduce PIP hyperextension.
