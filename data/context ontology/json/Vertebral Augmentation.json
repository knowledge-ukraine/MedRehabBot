            "Vertebral augmentation (V A) is a minimally invasive procedure using percutaneous injection of bone cement for rebuilding closed vertebral compression fractures. There are approximately 700,000\u2013750,000  cases of vertebral compression fractures reported per year in the United States.(26,28)In most cases, V A follows several weeks of failed conservative treatment for unremitting pain, often in older patients with osteoporotic collapse of anterior body of vertebra(1) or in patients with cancer-related vertebral compression fractures(21)",
            "V A attempts to restore the height of the collapsed anterior vertebral body and thereby reduce a kyphotic deformity(1) \u2013In vertebroplasty, bone cement (typically polymethylmethacrylate [PMMA])(21,26)s injected, with a syringe, directly into the fracture site (usually anterior body) \u2013In kyphoplasty, bone cement is injected into a cavity created with a balloon catheter,(2,3)which is proposed to increase vertebral body height and allow the PMMA to enter the space better(26) \u2013When performed together, vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are referred to as vertebral augmentation procedures(26) \u2013Vertebral body stenting is a promising new minimally invasive V A procedure(4)",
            "A newer technique called Kiva VCF uses a small spiral coil implant and reservoir to contain the bone cement(27) \u2013In a 2015 randomized controlled trial, the Kiva Safety and Effectiveness Trial (KAST) compared balloon kyphoplasty with the Kiva coil and implant \u2013Kiva was shown to be \u201cnon-inferior\u201d  compared to balloon kyphoplasty in reducing pain and improving functional outcomes at 30 days, 6 months, and 12 months postoperatively \u2013Of the 300 subjects, none reported complications due to cement",
