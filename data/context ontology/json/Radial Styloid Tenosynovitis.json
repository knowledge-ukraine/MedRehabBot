            "The authors of a systematic review designed to assess the effectiveness of hand therapy compared to corticosteroid injection in the treatment of DS found that the combined use of an injection and orthosis is better than either used alone. Interestingly, the authors found no studies assessing the efficacy of other components of hand therapy (e.g., exercise, manual therapy, physical agent modalities)(30)",
            "A study was conducted in India in which 30 patients (15 per group) were randomly assigned to receive either ultrasound (1MHz at 1.5 w/cm2 x 8 minutes with conducting gel) or phonophoresis with diclofenac gel and same ultrasound settings, 3 times per week for 3 weeks. The study researchers indicated that both ultrasound and phonophoresis resulted in significantly improved pain and grip strength for both groups and significantly greater pain reduction in the phonophoresis group compared to the ultrasound group(18)",
            "Authors of a randomized controlled clinical trial conducted in Iran propose a new orthosis design that allows wrist flexion and extension while immobilizing the thumb and restricting radial and ulnar deviation. The authors found no significant differences in pain and strength between the orthoses but report significantly greater satisfaction in the patients using the dynamic orthosis. This small study included a cohort of 12 patients, all women, randomly assigned to receive either a static thumb spica orthosis or a dynamic orthosis(28) . Problem Goal Intervention Expected Progression Home Program  Pain and edema Resolve pain and edemaPrescription, application of devices _ Administer supportive wrist hand thumb orthosis, which does not need to cover the interphalangeal joint since the extensor pollicis longus usually is not involved. The orthosis should be worn full-time, but time worn can decrease as symptoms improve(2) Kinesio taping   (33) _ Physical agents and thermal modalities _ Regular ice pack and ice massage to control pain and edema; moist heat for cases with joint stiffness(2,14) _ _ Electrotherapeutic modalities _ _ Ultrasound, phonophoresis, and low-level laser might be effective in decreasing pain(18,36) _ _ Manual therapy _ Gentle transverse friction massage over EPB and APL tendonsN/A Modify aggravating activities; caution against pinching and repetitive thumb movements  Reduced ROM, strength, and functionRestore ROM, strength, and functionTherapeutic exercises _ Gentle active ROM exercises in all thumb directions to maintain mobility; isometric thumb exercises (in neutral position) in acute and subacute stages, progressing to hand and wrist strengthening exercises, as tolerated(2)Functional training _ Progress to exercises that strengthen thumb and wrist for work or daily activitiesThumb and wrist strengthening exercises appropriate for stage of healing ."
