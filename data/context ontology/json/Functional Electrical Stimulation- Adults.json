All subjects had sustained SCIs and were ~12 months post injury -Subjects participated in a total of 9 hours of ABT therapy a week for 24 weeks. Results were compared to a delayed-treatment  control group -ABT interventions might have included robotic or manually assisted body-weight-support  locomotor training, FES-based  synthesized gait restoration, active and passive coordinated movement of the trunk and all extremities, FES cycling, electric stimulation, core and extremity strength training, and aquatic therapy -Significant improvements were found in the intervention groups, including the 10MWT speed and the 6MWT total distance",

BMD was identical in both groups at both locations 3 months after FES was discontinued \u2013Based on a retrospective study including 364 subjects in the United States, lower extremity FES cycling might minimize bone mass loss in patients with SCI-related paralysis(35) -FES ergometry was performed at the International Center for SCI or an in-home  setting and primarily utilized the FES RT 300-SL  ergometer, which recorded and stored data via the internet -Primary outcome measure was the presence of osteoporosis determined by DXA score \u20132.5.

Inclusion criteria were human participants with SCI, a period of FES gait training was included, and objective clinical, fitness, or functional outcome measures were assessed at both beginning and end of the study -Spasticity might be reduced in the LE in patients with incomplete SCI following FES application (4 studies) -Femoral bone mineral density did not appear to be changed after FES application (2 studies) -Muscle strength, measured by quadriceps force, torque, or moment, in patients with complete or incomplete SCI might increase with FES use (8 studies) -Walking speed and gait parameters might improve in some patients depending on the nature of their injury and specific deficits (11 studies). The energy cost of walking might or might not improve with use of FES (5 studies) -The authors concluded that there is insufficient evidence to determine whether FES is beneficial to walking due to methodologic differences (e.g., small sample sizes in most studies, dissimilar procedures, variability of patient type) in the included studies \u2013A United States\u2013based  study examined the feasibility of a sensor-based  threshold controller to automatically adjust stimulation to hip and trunk extensor muscles, thereby restoring upright posture in subjects with paralysis post SCI(36) -Subjects ranged in age from 41 to 60 years. V olunteers had SCIs at levels C6/C7, T5/T6, and T10 and all had implanted stimulators that were connected to 8 and/or 16 implanted electrodes -Seated forward trunk tilt and gravitational acceleration were sensed by a sternum-mounted wireless accelerometer and stimulation to the hip and trunk extensors was adjusted to correct and maintain upright sitting posture -The controller decreased the upper-limb  effort required when leaning forward while seated in a wheelchair -The effects of the system might facilitate increased UE reach and increased seated stability, resulting in decreased falls; however, the clinical utility of the system should be evaluated via future research",

Inclusion criteria were > 6 months since stroke onset, no active wrist extension, between 18 and 85 years of age, history of one stroke only, adequate cognitive status, and discharged from physical rehabilitation.

Twelve patients received conventional rehabilitation, including a passive wrist splint. Twelve patients received conventional rehabilitation plus a neuroprosthesis to assist in hand exercises -Outcome measures included the FMA, Action Research Arm Test, and a motor activity log -The group that received the neuroprosthesis showed a significantly greater improvement in the FMA (p < 0.01) and Action Research Arm Test (p < 0.05) \u2013Authors of an evidence-based  review of interventions for improving UE function post stroke concluded the following:  -There is strong evidence that FES improves upper extremity function in acute stroke, as well as chronic stroke, when used with conventional therapy(29) -In the case of chronic stroke, the UE might demonstrate improved motor control but not necessarily hand function(30) -Improvement in simple task performance might be achieved, but complex functional tasks that require additional effort might be accompanied by hypertonia, which might not be controlled by FES(3)",

Walking speed of both groups was measured with and without assistive devices (AFO in control group, FES in experimental group) -A significantly higher EMG output of the anterior tibialis muscle was found in some conditions -No significant differences in walking speed between the groups were noted \u2013Surface electrode FES training might improve gait speed in some patients poststroke(32) -Based on a meta-analysis  of eight studies using gait speed as the main outcome variable. Other inclusion variables were English-language  publication, surface FES used, and diagnosis of stroke -Eight studies with a total of 162 patients were included; four studies were RCTs -Analysis showed that gait speed without any device was improved following training with FES \u2013FES training might improve gait speed, but not necessarily LE function, in chronic stroke patients(21) -Based on a structured review and pooled data from eight studies. Inclusion criteria were randomized clinical trial, more than 50% of subjects in a study had a stroke diagnosis, patient was > 6 months poststroke, FES was compared to other treatments or a control group, functional outcomes were used -Outcome measures varied in the included studies, although all measured gait speed -Pooled data noted a significant difference in gait speed during 6MWT -The authors noted that other functional measures did not demonstrate the efficacy of FES -FES was not better than other interventions in improving gait speed in chronic stroke patients(33,34) \u2013Integrated FES and physiotherapy was found to be as effective as physiotherapy alone for improving gait speed in patients less than 6 months poststroke(38) -Based on an RCT in the United Kingdom, 20 patients within 6 months poststroke were randomized into group A (physiotherapy only) or group B (physiotherapy and FES) -Physiotherapy for all patients was performed 2 times per week and included individualized activities focused on improving gait; activities were goal-oriented  and task-specific  and included repetition and feedback. Group B also received FES stimulation to the common peroneal nerve for foot drop -Outcome measures were recorded pre and post intervention at week 1 and week 8, respectively. Follow-up  was performed again at week 20.
