            "Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common sensorimotor disorder characterized by an urge to move or restlessness focused usually in the lower limbs that is provoked by rest, relieved by movement or CNS arousal. Symptoms follow a circadian pattern and typically are worse at night. The International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG) endorses five essential criteria for diagnosis of RLS:(27,28) \u2013An urge to move the legs, sometimes accompanied by uncomfortable sensations in the legs \u2013The urge to move the legs and/or uncomfortable sensations worsen during periods of rest or inactivity \u2013The urge to move the legs and/or uncomfortable sensations are at least partially relieved by movement \u2013The urge to move the legs and/or uncomfortable sensations during rest only occur at night or are worse at night compared to the day \u2013The above features are not solely accounted for as symptoms primary to another medical condition or behavioral condition (e.g., myalgia, venous stasis, leg edema, arthritis) \u2013Specifiers are added related to the clinical course and/or clinical significance. The clinical course can be specified as either chronic-persistent RLS (untreated, symptoms have occurred on average at least twice per week for the past year) or intermittent RLS (untreated, symptoms have occurred on average less than twice per week for the past year, with at least five lifetime occurrences). Clinical significance specifiers relate to if the symptoms of RLS cause significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, educational, or other important areas of functioning by their impact on sleep, energy, ADLs, behavior, cognition, or mood(28)",
            "Classification of RLS \u2013Primary: idiopathic(9,29) -Considered a primary disease with no obvious cause or associated medical disorder \u2013Secondary: acquired(9,30) -Occurs in conjunction with underlying conditions such as pregnancy, end-stage  renal disease (ESRD), iron-deficiency  anemia, Parkinson disease, and migraine -Symptoms tend to remit when the underlying medical cause is resolved",
            "Authors of a review of the prevalence of RLS found that it ranged from 1.9% to 15% in the general population.(31) However, it is frequently unrecognized and misdiagnosed by  healthcare providers.(29) RLS is more common in women than men, especially as they age. This could be related to hormones, pregnancy, and iron status(31) \u2013In a study in western Turkey, prevalence of RLS was 7% in a sample of 4,003 individuals. Only 25.2% of those positive for RLS had received a previous RLS diagnosis(19)"

The prevalence decreasedto 4% after delivery(33)-Based on a Turkish study of 600 pregnant women, low hemoglobin levels, low iron intake, living in an extended family,and low educational status all are independent risk factors for developing RLS during pregnancy(24)\u2013History of migraine headaches(20,34)-Patients with migraine are 3 times more at risk for having RLS. Risk is even higher in patients with migraine with aura.The reasons for this increased risk are not fully understood but commonalities between the migraine and RLSexist, suchas comorbidity with sleep disorders-A total of 118,205 individuals with and without a diagnosis of migraine were followed for a mean of 7.38 years in astudy conducted in Taiwan.

            "Nonpharmacological treatments commonly recommended include sleep hygiene (adjusting bedtime routines), bathing in hot or cold water, rubbing or massaging the affected limbs, physical activities such as walking, stretching, and exercise, relaxation exercises including biofeedback and yoga, and distraction with mental activity (e.g., reading a book during symptoms)(18)",
            "Nonpharmacological treatments including physical therapy interventions and exercise remain investigational. The lack of quality studies limits strong evidence for these treatments \u2013Authors of a systematic review on alternative therapies for RLS evaluated 18 studies of different treatments. The results showedthat RLS symptoms can be significantly decreased by exercise training, electrical stimulation, pneumatic compression devices, light therapy, and acupuncture. The authors noted that the lack of RCTs makes the level of evidence weak(32) \u2013Authors of a systematic review evaluated 15 RCTs on the effects of exercise in patients with RLS and ESRD. The results showed that exercise training can significantly reduce the severity of RLS symptoms. The types of exercise in the RCTs varied; therefore, more RCTs are needed to determine specific exercise regimes(38)",
            "Interventions that have some support for relieving RLS symptoms include \u2013Near-infrared  light treatments -Based on a United States study involving 21 participants with RLS, near-infrared  light improves symptoms of RLS. Participants were treated with near-infrared  light 3 times a week for 4 weeksIRLSRS scores significantly improved(22) \u2013Aerobic exercise -Based on an RCT conducted in Iran that included 26 patients on hemodialysis who had untreated RLS(8) -Patients were assigned to either the supervised aerobic exercise group (30 minutes of stationary cycling between hour 2 and 3 during hemodialysis, 3 times/week; 5-minute  warm-up  and a 5-minute  cool-down included) or a control group (typical daily activities only) -After 16 weeks, the exercise group\u2019s mean RLS symptom severity decreased by an average of 5.5 points compared to the control group\u2019s mean symptom reduction of 0.53 as measured by the IRLSSG Rating Scale. However, there was no statistical difference between groups in quality of life at the end of the 16 weeks as measured by the Short Form 36 Health Survey Questionnaire (SF-36) \u2013Yoga might reduce symptoms of RLS, improve sleep and mood, and reduce stress levels(7) -Based on a small United States study in which 10 women with moderate to severe RLS participated in an 8-week Iyengar yoga program designed specifically for individuals who experience RLS -Subjects were to attend 90-minute  yoga classes twice a week and complete at least 30 minutes a week of home practice on non-class  days  -Following the 8-week  intervention 9/10 subjects reported a decrease in RLS symptom severity, with a 62% average reduction in overall symptom severity -IRLSSG Rating Scale scores significantly declined with increasing minutes of home practice sessions and total homework minutes -Participants had significant improvements in sleep, perceived stress, and mood .
