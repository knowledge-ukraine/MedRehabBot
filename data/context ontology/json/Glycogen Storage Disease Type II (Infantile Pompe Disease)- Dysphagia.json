            "Glycogen storage disease type II (Pompe disease) is a rare autosomal recessive neuromuscular disorder caused by metabolic deficiency.(1,2) Glycogen is a carbohydrate (called a polysaccharide) synthesized by humans in order to be used for fuel or structural support or metabolized for energy.(2) Glycogen is synthesized and stored almost entirely in the liver and the muscles and is the primary source of stored energy for muscle activity during exercise.(2) In Pompe disease, there is a deficiency of the acid alpha-1,4-glucosidase,  an enzyme that breaks down glycogen in lysosomes (the part of a cell that holds enzymes).(2) As a result, the lysosomes in the cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle cells accumulate glycogen.(2)When the onset of Pompe disease is in the first few months of life (typically before 6 months), it is referred to as early-onset  Pompe disease or infantile Pompe disease.(34) Infantile Pompe is the most severe form of the disorder.

The pharyngeal phase is defined by initiation of the pharyngeal swallow response, pharyngeal clearance, and airway closure to prevent aspiration (food or liquid entering the airway) or choking.(13) Lastly, the esophageal phaseis characterized by relaxation and opening of the upper esophageal sphincter with transit of the bolus to the stomach via peristaltic motion.(26) In patients with infantile Pompe disease, feeding and swallowing difficulties,accompanied by the need for supplemental nutrition,are prevalent.(15) These patients also have difficulty with secretion management due to inefficient and/or infrequent dry swallowing, which causes pooling of oral secretions as well as drooling.(3) Global muscle wasting, hypotonia,tongue weakness, pharyngeal weakness, poor oral ROM, and increased effort for breathing all contribute to dysphagia in patients with infantile Pompe disease.(3,16)These deficits often result in poor articulationand hypernasal speech.

The SLP describes oral and pharyngeal swallow physiology, assesses airway protection, and determines the effectiveness of any therapeutic strategy/intervention, including viscosity changes.(27) In contrast to the CSE, the VFSS provides critical information on the pharyngeal phase of the swallow and airway protection.(26) Due to the potential harmful effects of ionizing radiation on children, a repeat VFSS should be completed only after careful consideration of the risk-benefits of additional radiation exposure;it should not be used to monitor minor changes in swallowing.(26) During the VFSS, the following physiologic(10) -Labial seal/closure -Sucking -Tongue-cupping/tongue  tip elevation for bolus formation/control -Mastication -Anterior-posterior  lingual movement for transport -Initiation of the pharyngeal swallow response -Soft palate elevation and retraction -Anterior hyoid excursion (older children/adolescents) -Laryngeal elevation (older children/adolescents) -Epiglottic inversion (toddlers/children/adolescents) -Laryngeal closure -Pharyngeal stripping wave -Tongue base retraction -Pharyngoesophageal segment opening -Esophageal clearanceModified Barium SwallowT709077 Oral phase deficits such as reduced labial seal, decreased suck strength, poor oral preparation of bolus, tongue thrust, poor oral transit, oral residue, and impaired mastication(3,8,16)  Pharyngeal phase deficits such as nasal regurgitation, delayed initiation of pharyngeal swallow response with boluses reaching pyriform sinuses prior to swallow initiation, upper esophageal sphincter dysfunction, weak and ineffective swallow, and reduced airway protection resulting in penetration and/or aspiration(8,16) Mild to moderate residue throughout the pharynx after completion of the swallow is noted in the pharyngeal phase(3,16)T709077FEES is performed to evaluate the anatomy and physiology of the pharynx and larynx, the patient\u2019s ability to manage secretions, and the patient\u2019s ability to swallow foods and liquids(27) In addition, it can be used to explore a variety of diagnostic interventions such as postures, maneuvers, consistency changes, and flow rate alterations.(32) As with the VFSS, age-appropriate  modifications need to be incorporated into the procedure. Food may be dyed to enhance visibility. FEES is preferred over VFSS when patients have safety issues related to radiation exposure or when they need retesting. Due to the invasive nature of the procedure, it is sometimes difficult to obtain accurate representation of a normal swallow in young children; therefore, patient selection is important.(32)ASHA in conjunction with the American Board of Swallowing and Swallowing Disorders has published several online documents, including the Dysphagia Competency Verification Tool (DCVT), relevant to the technical aspects of FEES and the qualifications required to perform FEES(33) -For detailed information on FEES and endoscopic examinations for dysphagia, see  Clinical Review\u2026Dysphagia",

        "treatment summary": [
            "Infants: \u2013Flow rate: Nipple selection is important, as this facilitates suck-swallow-breathe  (SSB) triad during feeding. If nipple flow rate is too fast it can result in poor coordination of SSB, thereby impacting physiologic stability and potentially airway protection.(36) Enlarged holes create excessive fluid flow, which may lead to choking \u2013Positioning: Infants can be feed upright/cradled or side-lying.  Side-lying  has been shown to be beneficial in maintaining physiologic stability and also increased volume when feeding(37) \u2013Pacing: With the aim of maintaining adequate breathing, this technique involves tilting or removing the bottle from the infants mouth when the infant appears fatigued to allow for a pause to breath(38)  \u2013Modification of liquids: Liquids might be modified (e.g., thickened) to assist the patient in controlling liquids in the oral and pharyngeal phase of the swallow and to improve the effectiveness and safety of the swallow. Trials of different liquid consistencies should be tested during instrumental assessments (e.g., VFSS, FEES) to determine if thickened liquid is beneficial in protecting airway. Liquids should not be thickened based on clinical evaluation only.(30)Risks and benefits of thickening should be discussed with family and medical team",
            "Toddlers and older children: \u2013Oral-sensory  motor therapy: The objectives of oral-sensory motor therapy are to maintain or increase coordination of oral motor movements to improve feeding skills and/or to increase or maintain normal sensory function during mealtimes. This can include specific instruction on cup drinking, straw drinking, spoon feeding, and the development of more appropriate oral-motor  skills such as but not limited to mastication \u2013Positioning/postural adaptations: Infants and children with infantile Pompe disease have significant abnormalities in their posture, tone, and movement that influence feeding and swallowing.(16) In these cases, the SLP may collaborate with a PT and/or OT in providing a seating position that is most beneficial for feeding \u2013Adaptive equipment: Adaptive equipment for eating and feeding therapy might include specific nipples, bottles, pacifiers, cups, spoons, and forks. The SLP might collaborate with the OT in selecting adaptive equipment for self-feeding \u2013Modification of liquids: Liquids might be modified (e.g., thickened) to assist the patient in controlling liquids in the oral and pharyngeal phases of the swallow and to improve the effectiveness and safety of the swallow if aspiration was identified after VFSS or FEES. Trials of different liquid consistencies should be performed during instrumental assessments (e.g., VFSS, FEES) to determine if beneficial in protecting airway. Liquids should not be thickened based on clinical evaluation alone.(30)Modification of drinking vessels might be necessary to accommodate the thickened liquids, and parents/caregivers should receive training and information regarding thickened liquids. Risks and benefits of thickening should be discussed with family and medical team \u2013Modification of solid foods : Solid foods might be modified to assist the child in chewing and controlling the bolus. In addition, recommendations of food consistency and food type must be aligned with the family\u2019s dietary habits and culture. The following guidelines are indicators of ages of nutritional readiness and oral skills for solid foods in normal development; however, the child\u2019s individual oromotor/feeding skills, motor development and food allergies must be considered when introducing new textures of foods:(11) -6 to 8 months \u2013 purees -8 to 9 months \u2013 mashed lumpy/mixed textures -Finger food -7 to 8 months onwards \u2013 toast/biscuits -10 to 11 months onwards \u2013 soft chopped food -10 to 12 months onwards \u2013 firm finger foods -15 months onwards \u2013 foods that require sustained biting and chewing",
