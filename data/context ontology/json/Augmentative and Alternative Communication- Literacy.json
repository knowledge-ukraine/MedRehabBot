            "AAC is a system for communication that supplements or replaces verbal communication (speech) and includes four main components: symbols, aids, strategies, and techniques(1) \u2013Symbols include objects, drawings, photographs, and print (i.e., words, letters, sentences)(1) \u2013Aids can be relatively simple (e.g., communication boards) or complex devices (e.g., electronic devices) for transmitting or receiving messages(1) \u2013Strategies refer to the methods by which symbols can be conveyed in the easiest, most efficient manner. For example, symbol selection methods (linear or row column scanning) and keyboard arrangements are considered \"strategies\" that affect the rate of symbol selection(1) \u2013Techniques refer to the ways in which the messages are selected for transmission (e.g., direct selection, scanning)(1)",
            "Children with developmental and physical disabilities who use AAC are a heterogeneous group with complex communication needs arising from a variety of etiologies, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), cerebral palsy, and Down syndrome. Due to an increased focus on early intervention, the population of children who use AAC has changed in recent years to include much younger children, children with a greater range of disabilities, and children from more diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds(45)",

Children who rely on AAC have fewer literacy experiences in the classroom and at home than their peers without disabilities. In addition, the quality of these literacy experiences also differs, with the children who rely on AAC having fewer opportunities to participate in meaningful ways in literacy activities.(49) Balanced literacy programs that are effective for children who do not use AAC have also been shown to increase communication and literacy skills in children who use AAC(3)",
            "Many children and adults who use AAC have low literacy skills and their difficulties cannot be adequately explained or predicted by the presence of severe speech impairments or their cognitive and linguistic functioning.(44) Not all individuals who use AAC experience difficulties in reading and spelling \u2013Researchers in Sweden and Ireland sought to explain the variability in literacy abilities among AAC users by examining the similarities and differences among groups of good readers, single-word  readers (\u201cdecoders\u201d),and nonreaders.(44) All 28 participants had cerebral palsy, used AAC, and were described as functioning in the average range of intellectual ability. Participants were given two single-word  vocabulary tests, a measure of nonverbal cognition, and researcher-developed  phonological awareness, reading, and spelling measures. The researchers analyzed and compared all three groups\u2019 performance on phonological awareness, spelling, reading, and memory tasks. Findings of this study indicated: -There was no single factor that could account for reading ability -There was no obvious relationship between type of schooling, speech ability, and reading proficiency -Working memory skills are important in the early stage of reading development; however, there was no significant difference in phonological short-term memory scores between good readers and decoders -The good readers achieved significantly higher spelling scores than the decoders -The researchers concluded that future research should focus on developing sensitive diagnostic tools to profile individual reading abilities and on identifying effective instructional practices for this population"

        "referral to other disciplines": "Several professionals might be involved in the school assessment and treatment team for a child with a physical or developmental disability:(3)An OT can assist with fine motor and adaptive skills. Collaborate with the OT on AAC support as necessary (e.g., optimal way to access the device) and participation barriers caused by fine motor impairments(4)Refer to a PT if the child has significant motor deficits and/or poor/weak posture that negatively affect speech production, class participation, and overall health. The PT might consult on integrating physical therapy goals into the daily routine. For example, positioning is often a concern for children with severe developmental and physical disabilities and is often an important part of the daily physical therapy program (e.g., standing in a support frame, lying stomach down).(30) The SLP and teacher should be aware of the physical effort involved in therapeutic physical tasks and pair more difficult physical activities with less demanding cognitive tasks (listening to a story for pleasure)(30)A recreational therapist might be involved with the team to assist the child in developing recreational skillsSocial services can assist the family in negotiating assistance systems (e.g., medical services, daycare)Refer to a behavioral psychologist if the child exhibits any challenging behaviors, including self-injurious behaviors ",
        "other considerations": [],
        "treatment summary": [
            "Overall considerations \u2013Effective literacy intervention for the child who uses AAC requires early support of language to prepare the child for development of early literacy skills(6,29) \u2013A coordinated effort among teachers, the SLP, the family, and the child is important for effective and efficient use of AAC at home and in the classroom(6,29) \u2013A balanced literacy curriculum that includes development of phonemic awareness, vocabulary, word recognition, decoding, fluency, reading comprehension, and writing using a range of literacy tasks has been found to be effective for individuals who use AAC as well as for those who do not use AAC(3,26) \u2013Rather than a single system of communication, the assessment team should identify multiple methods of communication that the child might use in different situations.(29) Some forms of AAC (e.g., manual signs) are more easily accessed but understood only by some communication partners; voice output communication aids (VOCAs) are more widely understood but might not be available at the moment that the child wants to communicate",
            "Team consultation and collaboration \u2013The SLP might be involved in instructing teachers/paraeducators/peers and/or parents on how to use the AAC system with the child. Instruction will vary with the individual\u2019s knowledge but might include the importance of communication, the relationship between behavior and communication, prompting students/peers to use AAC, and how to recognize and respond to the child\u2019s communicative attempts(32) \u2013The SLP might work with the team in adapting the curriculum, adapting assessment tools, operating/programming the AAC system, and selecting appropriate vocabulary",
            "Assessment, selection, programming, instruction, and monitoring of the AAC system: AAC is typically categorized into unaided systems of communication and aided systems of communication \u2013Unaided approaches to AAC involve using the child\u2019s body to communicate by means of manual signs, gestures, vocalizations, facial expressions, or body movements(33) \u2013Aided communication approaches include light-technology devices and high-technology  devices(33) \u2013Light-technology  AAC refers to nonelectronic external devices such as alphabet boards, symbol-based  topic boards, dry erase boards, and programs such as the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) \u2013High-technology  systems are electronic devices such as speech-generating  systems. Speech-generating  devices have been classified into two main types: devices that allow for formation of new messages and devices that use word or whole-phrase  retrieval of prerecorded messages. Caregivers and patients should be involved in selecting the device \u2013Modeling of the use of the device/system is an essential part of the instructional process. The teacher/SLP/caregiver models the AAC system and integrates the system in his or her own communication interactions, literacy activities, and/or book discussions during naturalistic and motivating situations. Modeling allows input experience for the child(34) \u2013Factors to consider when selecting and programming a high-technology  or light-technology  device include: -V ocabulary/symbol considerations -When selecting vocabulary for use with the AAC system, the SLP/teacher should consider the child\u2019s preferences and functional motivations as well as vocabulary to support the child\u2019s participation in literacy activities and other classroom activities(3) -Target vocabulary used with the AAC system should be salient to the child and able to be modeled in educational, naturalistic, routine, and motivating situations(34) -When introducing new symbols, routine situations should be used so that the child\u2019s attention can be focused on learning the new word rather than understanding a novel situation(34) -When choosing vocabulary to use with AAC, it is important to use people\u2019s names as well as social phrases (e.g., my turn, what\u2019s that, I don\u2019t like it, I want more) to encourage social closeness(4,34) -Emotion labels are important for the child to talk about school and other past events. They also allow the child to communicate when frustrated(34) -Inclusion of action words will help foster more complex syntactic development or symbol combinations(34)  -The system should also be programmed or designed to encourage participation across a range of literacy tasks such as phonological awareness, spelling, guided reading, and independent reading and writing. For example, a child who uses a communication board might have different boards for different classroom activities (e.g., calendar time, circle time) so that responses can be easily located(4) -Access considerations -There are two ways of indicating symbols with aided AAC systems, direct selection and scanning. Direct selection involves the child directly selecting the symbol (i.e., using a finger, using eye gaze). For those who have difficulty with motor control, scanning might be used(34) -There are two kinds of scanning: partner assisted and electronic. In electronic scanning, the AAC device presents the choices electronically. For example, a light might go on next to each symbol one-by-one.  When a light indicates the desired symbol, the child selects it by hitting a switch.(34) Some devices allow for direct selection or scanning -In partner-assisted  scanning, the communication partner scans through symbols one-by-one  (i.e., by pointing). When the partner arrives at the desired choice, the child can indicate by vocalizing, moving an arm, or using an eyeblink(34) -Display presentation considerations -Presentation refers to the organization and layout of the concepts within a display. Variables in presentation include the permanence of the display (i.e., static vs. dynamic display), layout of the display (i.e., grid or visual scene displays), number of representations on the display, size of the symbols, and color organization(35) -In a static display, all symbols can be viewed simultaneously but are limited in number. In a dynamic display, the person can navigate different electronic or nonelectronic pages to find other symbols(35) -Symbols can be displayed on a grid (rows and columns of pictures) or as a visual scene display. A visual scene display contains a picture or photograph with hot spots that allow the user to select items within the scene. For example, a scene might be a kitchen and the user might select an item of food. It is theorized that visual scene displays might reduce cognitive demands in finding and using correct symbols because the symbols are displayed in a meaningful context.(35) Preliminary research indicates that young children perform more accurately when communication symbols are embedded in meaningful contexts and depict full representations of familiar persons and objects(45) -Recent AAC applications developed for use on mainstream devices (mobile phones with texting, iPads, iTouch) have made AAC more affordable and more available, and have also given users an opportunity to \u201cblend in.\u201d(45,47) For example, researchers who conducted a study in Sweden found that texting with picture symbols and speech increased independence and participation in adults with complex communication needs and intellectual disabilities.(48) However, researchers cautioned that only minimal research has focused on improving the design of AAC technologies to maximize outcomes for children. Most of the available mobile technology apps have replicated traditional AAC interfaces that were developed in the early years of AAC and most are not based on research evidence. There is a need to develop a new generation of AAC systems that are responsive to the needs of children who use them(45)",
            "Preliteracy and literacy interventions for children who use AAC \u2013Preliteracy interventions: Storybook reading is an important activity in emergent literacy and language learning in which a parent, teacher, or older child reads a text to a child and talks about the story, relating it to the child\u2019s experiences while the child listens to the story, comments on events, relates the story to his/her life, asks questions and/or retells part of the story. During this activity, the child is exposed to a wide range of grammar and vocabulary and has the opportunity to talk about events and concepts not immediately present in the environment (\u201cdisplaced talk\u201d)(49) \u2013Storybook reading interactions with children with AAC have been found to be qualitatively different from those with children with typically developing communication. Typically developing children often choose the book themselves and choose the same book. In contrast, parents are often the ones choosing the book for the child who uses AAC. As a result, shared book reading sessions might not be as responsive to the needs and interests of the child. Also, children who use AAC do not usually have access to AAC during story reading interactions, reducing their ability to communicate and learn emergent literacy skills(49) -Researchers in the United States investigated the effects of a communication partner instruction strategy for parents of children using AAC during storybook-reading  contexts in two single-subject multiple-probe-across-participants design studies with six parent/child dyads.(43) The program, Improving Partner Applications of Augmentative Communication Techniques (ImPAACT), was designed to facilitate early language and communication skills in children who use ACC. Techniques included in the program were parent-provided  AAC model, parent-asked wh-question, parent-answered  wh-question,  parent provided an expectant delay. Child-dependent  measures included  the total number of communicative turns during each 10-minute  story reading session. Results indicated that all of the parents achieved a high level of competency using the communication partner interaction strategy. All of the children increased the number of turns that they took while reading stories -Researchers in the United States compared the vocabulary used by 29 typically developing kindergartners while being read a story with vocabulary on commercially available storybook communication displays marketed for individuals with AAC needs.(46) They found that vocabulary on commercially available displays did not include vocabulary most used by kindergartners and that communication displays might need to be modified to provide sufficient vocabulary to allow participation during storybook reading activities \u2013Literacy interventions -Literacy intervention for children using AAC has been criticized for being too teacher-directed  and reactive rather than child-directed  and constructive(30) -Authors of a systematic review published in 2018 of literacy interventions for individuals who use AAC reported findings from 9 studies involving a total of 24 subjects. Authors found that overall, reading instruction did have positive effects on single-word reading ability. Results indicated that phonological approaches, sight-word  approaches, and a combination of both of these approaches showed very large effect sizes; however, generalizability of results was limited due to small studies and heterogenous study populations(2) -Authors of a systematic review evaluated 8 single-subject  design studies that taught phonological awareness and individual-word  reading to a total of 26 children who used AAC.(42) The authors did not form any conclusions regarding the best practices. Studies described a variety of reading instructions tasks (sound matching, sound categorization, phoneme identification, spelling, word identification, phoneme segmentation, word identification) and listed a variety of modifications: pointing to a picture of a word, pointing to a letter after hearing a phoneme, using tiles printed with letters or typing on a keyboard, using markers on a table to indicate phonemes. Review authors recommended the development of standard phonological-awareness  and reading assessments for this population. They also reported a need to replicate the results of effective reading interventions across different contexts and groups of children and advocated a central database to aggregate the results of research studies -In a study conducted in the United States, researchers examined the effectiveness of a strategy to teach sound-letter correspondence and spelling of consonant-vowel-consonant  (CVC) combinations to two young children who used AAC in inclusive preschool classrooms.(47) Components of the intervention included: 1) arranging the environment to create adult-directed  teaching and active teacher-child  interactions to learn sound-letter correspondence (literacy centers with an adult at the CVC center), 2) providing adaptations to support the active participation of children using AAC (child points to letter or letter combination after the adult says the sound), and 3) using \u201cnaturalistic\u201d instructional strategies. Naturalistic instructional strategies include arranging the environment, providing antecedent prompts to facilitate learning with minimal errors, and being responsive to a learner\u2019s interests and behaviors. Both participants exhibited significant improvement in learning CVC combinations -In a small study (N = 3) conducted in the United States, researchers investigated the use of the alphabet supplementation technique, typically used to increase comprehension in listeners with low speech intelligibility, for increasing both speech intelligibility and literacy in adults with disabilities. All three individuals in this study used AAC due to low speech intelligibility, but also had minimal literacy. Researchers found that training initial-letter  identification for a core set of words both improved reading vocabulary and increased understanding of communication by listeners (50) \u2013Literacy intervention for individuals who use AAC should be guided by the same principles as evidence-based  literacy interventions for other individuals who struggle with reading; the need for oral responses during instruction should be reduced and/or eliminated, and the integration of AAC systems with instruction is essential.(26,36) For detailed information on preliteracy intervention, please see Clinical Review\u2026Language Disorders: Preschool Children (Preliteracy Skills) ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T709110 and Clinical Review\u2026Reading Disabilities: Early Elementary School-Aged Children ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T709075 \u203aSee Description/use, Indications , and Guidelines for Use of AAC , above. . Problem Goal Intervention Expected Progression Home Program  Lack of participation in classroom literacy tasks due to inadequate AAC supportIncrease ability of child to participate in daily literacy events at home and school with improved AAC supportUse of AAC system to increase communication ability to allow the child to participate in balanced literacy tasks _ If the child uses an external AAC system, the system can be specifically programmed to support the child\u2019s participation in literacy activities, including phonological awareness, spelling, guided reading, and independent reading and writing(3) _ _ The teacher, parents, and classroom peers might be instructed on the specific communication system and how to best communicate with the child to increase opportunities for participation in literacy activities. For example, yes/no questions or multiple choice questions might be more appropriate for the child who communicates in one- or two-word phrases.(4) In addition, the SLP might be the most familiar with the communication abilities of the child and might consult with the teacher/ paraprofessional to assist them in understanding how the child communicates with different persons and in different situations _The child will learn to use an AAC system and increase communication and participation in literacy/ classroom activities. Progression will depend on the task and might vary with the conversational partner; the amount of cueing, prompting, or assistance; and the length of the responseAAC system should be used at home with parent/caregiver support  Lack of participation in literacy activities due to physical access barriersCollaborate with an OT or PT to reduce physical access barriers to classroom participation in literacy activitiesCollaboration with OT or PT to reduce physical access barriers to classroom participation _ Participation in classroom literacy activities might be influenced by a child\u2019s fine motor or gross motor impairments. For example, participation in independent reading might be hindered by the child\u2019s inability to turn pages of a book independently. A solution might involve the use of page fluffers (e.g., pieces of foam adhered to each page to better separate pages) or placement of pages in a binder with page protectors. Collaborate with an OT or PT to identify and resolve physical barriers to classroom participation(4) _The child will increase participation in literacy/ classroom activities and physical barriers will be resolved. Progression will depend on the task and might vary with the conversational partner; the amount of cueing, prompting, or assistance; and the length of the responseN/A  Poor emergent literacy skillsIncrease the child\u2019s emergent literacy skillsAdapt emergent literacy activities to the skills of the child (49) _ Children who use AAC often do not have as many early literacy experiences as their peers. Early literacy experiences are essential for developing literacy skills and can be adapted using the AAC system. The SLP can train communication partners (family members, teachers, peers, or paraeducators) to adapt interactive story-book reading activities to the child\u2019s skills: \u2013Allow the child to choose books of interest(49) \u2013Introduce the topic of the book by discussing related experiences(49) \u2013Model the use of the AAC system while reading a text. The AAC system might include a VOCA which produces a line from the text or pictures/ symbols that represent content words(38) \u2013Pause and provide sufficient wait time for the child to participate in the reading activity \u2013Model using the AAC system while asking open-ended questions related to the book and the child\u2019s experiences \u2013Respond to the communication attempts of the child \u2013The AAC system might have to be specifically programmed with vocabulary needed to participate in story-book reading activities(46) \u2013Read the same book repeatedly to encourage the child to retell parts of the story(49)The child will increase responses during shared storybook activities and will increase knowledge of vocabulary, print materials, and narrativesParents/caregivers can be instructed on how to modify shared story- book reading at home  Poor phonemic awareness (PA) skillsIncrease the child\u2019s PA skillsAdapt PA instruction to the skills of the child _ The following are ways that PA skills can be adapted to children who use AAC:(49) _ _ Phoneme matching task: The instructor says a sound (/b/) and presents four pictures. The instructor asks child to indicate which picture begins with the sound /b/ by the method that is appropriate for the child (e.g., a VOCA, communication board, eye pointing to the picture that begins with the target sound). This task can be done with both initial and final phonemes _ _ Sound-blending task: The instructor presents individual sounds of a word in segments (m---a---n). The child is asked to select a picture by eye gaze (out of four) that matches the word formed by joining the segmented sounds(49) _The child will improve performance on PA tasks such as identifying initial and final sounds in words and blending words. The child will then use these skills in single- word reading and in beginning writing skills(37)None specified  Poor letter-sound knowledgeIncrease ability of child to understand letter- sound correspondenceAdapt letter/sound instruction tasks to the skills of the child _ Present an array of letters in a format that allows the child to choose specific letters. For example, say \u201cTouch the letter that says /m/\" or \"Touch the letters that spell 'mat'.\u201d The child can touch, point, use eye gaze, or use his/her dedicated AAC system to indicate letters. If letters are printed on a computer, be sure that the font matches the style used in the classroom so that it is more easily recognizable and generalizable (e.g., a sans-serif font). Provide modeling and scaffolding as necessary(36) _Progression will vary with the abilities of the child. Evidence- based reading programs specify the scope and sequence of letter/ sound instruction; these programs can be followed and adapted for the child who uses AAC. For more information on reading instruction adaptations for students who use AAC, see the website on AAC and literacy at Pennsylvania State University: http:// aacliteracy.psu.edu/A home program or homework might be developed to assist the child in learning and generalizing letter- sound correspondence skills  Poor decoding and word-reading abilityIncrease ability of child to decode words and read sight wordsAdapt word reading tasks to the skills of the child _ Words might be presented in a format so that the child can indicate a word on the AAC system (e.g., by pointing, eye gaze, switch). The instructor can say the word or provide a picture and have the child choose the correct written word. Researchers have investigated the effects of teaching word recognition and word decoding to students with AAC with results indicating improved reading skills.(39,40) Computer programs can also provide further practice with word reading(39) _Progression will vary with the abilities of the child. Initial tasks might include a few commonly used words that are important for communication; more words are added in instruction as the child learnsHomework might include practice with decoding and sight- word recognition  Poor reading comprehension abilityIncrease child\u2019s ability to understand textProvide support for increasing child\u2019s comprehension of text _ Evidence-based comprehension instructional strategies such as previewing text, building background knowledge, text summarizing activities, graphic organizers, and peer tutoring can be used with the child who uses AAC. In addition, materials such as taped books, computerized books, audiobooks, video, and role plays/theater can be used to enhance comprehension. Language and literacy goals should both be considered when choosing books and texts for comprehension activities. During classroom reading activities, the child should be given the opportunity to participate (e.g., programming specific lines into AAC device) _Progression will vary with the abilities of the child. For example, the child might begin with simple words and phrases and progress to connected textHomework might include shared-book reading with parent/ caregiver to improve both language and reading comprehension  Poor writing ability Increase child\u2019s ability to write/convey ideas through writingAdapt writing activities to skills of the child _ A range of writing activities should be integrated into the daily curricula. Possible ways the SLP might support the child\u2019s writing development include:(41) \u2013Identifying the best way that the child can compose text. This might include a combination of high-tech and low-tech systems (e.g., eye gaze frame, Dynavox, an alternative keyboard, an alternative mouse system) \u2013Ensuring that the vocabulary in the AAC system/s support a range of writing tasks \u2013Ensuring that the AAC system/s can be used easily for both communication and assigned writing tasks, allowing the child to move easily between oral and written tasks as he/ she is composing \u2013Assisting with home-school communication to provide experiences that the child can write about. Formats of information transfer include activity logs, journals, remnants, and photographs \u2013Assisting in building background knowledge of the child to support writing \u2013Provide scaffolding (provide enough assistance so that the child can complete task at his/her level) or instruct a paraeducator to provide scaffolding for the child during writing tasks \u2013Assist the child in publishing or sharing his or her written work with the class. This might include using photographs instead of drawings to write about experiences and using the AAC device to read aloud the written work(49)Progression will vary with the abilities of the child and the specific writing tasks. Examples of progressive tasks include increasing independence with writing activities; progressing from simpler writing activities (single word labeling a picture) to more complex writing activities (sentences, paragraphs)The SLP or teacher might assist with home- school communication to provide experiences about which the child can write. Formats of information transfer include activity logs, journals, remnants, and photographs.(41) As the child progresses with writing skills, written homework can be completed at home  ."
