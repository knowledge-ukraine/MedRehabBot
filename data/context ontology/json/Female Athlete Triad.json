            "The female athlete triad (the triad) is a functional hypothalamic syndrome in girls and women in sports. The triad syndrome is associated with potential long-term  health consequences, including menstrual irregularities, reduced bone mass, musculoskeletal injuries, stress fractures, anxiety, depression, endothelial dysfunction, abnormal blood lipid profiles, and increased mortality(8)",
            "The three major components of the triad syndrome are low energy availability with or without disordered eating, menstrual disturbances, and low bone mineral density (BMD) (15,24) \u2013Low energy availability(EA)with or without disordered eating: Relative energy deficiency results because daily energy intake (EI) fails to counterbalance the increased calories expended in sport.(9) Persistent negative energy balance leads to compromised BMI, suboptimal general metabolism, menstrual dysfunction, and low age-adjusted BMD.(5)Eating disorders (e.g., anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa) can contribute to low EA. However, not all females who have energy deficiency engage in disordered eating (14) -Higher rates of eating disorders and triad-related risk factors have been reported among female athletes in sports that emphasize leanness (e.g., gymnastics, figure skating, dancing, cheerleading, distance running, pole vaulting, lightweight rowing, diving, synchronized swimming,swimming) (10,11,12,18,19,22,24) \u2013Menstrual disturbances: Irregularities include primary amenorrhea (failure of menses by age 16), secondary amenorrhea (suppression of luteal function causing loss of menses for 3 or more months), and/or oligomenorrhea (reduction of the luteal phase causing time between menses to be 35 days or more) (23,24) \u2013Low BMD: Compromised bone metabolism and demineralization increase the risk of fracture throughout the lifespan (23,24)"

Males along with females can experience some of the same negative side effects. In 2014, the International Olympic Committee (IOC)adopted a new, more comprehensive term, relative energy deficiency in sport (RED-S).  Negative potential performance effects of RED-S  include decreased muscle strength, decreased endurance, increased injury risk, decreased training response, impaired judgement, decreased coordination, decreased concentration, irritability, depression, and decreased glycogen stores (21,24) .

        "Female high school athletes\u2019 knowledge of the female athlete triad is low. Authors of an RCT evaluated knowledge gains following viewing of a 10-minute social cognitive theory-based  triad educational videocompared to a control group that participated in an unrelated team-building  activity (N = 93, mean age 15.9). Although both groups demonstrated knowledge gains, improvements were significantly greater following viewing of the educational video when compared to the control group. These findings support the use of brief educational sessions that are practical to implement(20)",
        "Continuing education about the triad is indicated for coaches of female athletes, especially in sports that emphasize leanness and whose athletes have been determined to be at higher risk for the syndrome. In a convenience sample (N = 309) of U.S. NCAA Division 1 coaches, coaches who had received training about the triad scored higher on the study\u2019s  self-reported questionnaire about triad knowledge than coaches who had not received training. Those who coached low-body-weight  sports (cross country and rowing) had significantly more knowledge than all other coaches, even those in gymnastics and diving where scoring is based in part on aesthetics. Overall, the study documented a lack of information among coaches but indicates that participation in formative training can reduce this problem(6) Coding Matrix References are rated using the following codes, listed in order of strength: MPublished meta-analysis SRPublished systematic or integrative literature review RCTPublished research (randomized controlled trial) RPublished research (not randomized controlled trial) CCase histories, case studies GPublished guidelinesRVPublished review of the literature RUPublished research utilization report QIPublished quality improvement report LLegislation PGRPublished government report PFRPublished funded reportPPPolicies, procedures, protocols XPractice exemplars, stories, opinions GIGeneral or background information/texts/reports UUnpublished research, reviews, poster presentations or other such materials CPConference proceedings, abstracts, presentation"
