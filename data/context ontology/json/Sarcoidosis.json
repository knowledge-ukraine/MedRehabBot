            "Sarcoidosis is a multisystemic inflammatory disorder characterized by non-necrotizing/noncaseating  epithelioid cell granulomas. It mostly affects the lungs but can involve any organ in the body. Etiology is unknown(1)",

Incidence in the United States is higher among Blacks (35.5/100,000) than Whites (10.9/100,000).Incidence in Spain is 1.3/100,000, Eastern Europe 3.7/100,000, and Japan 1/100,000. The average age of presentation is 48 years (20)",

Optional components included relaxation therapy, nutrition counseling, psychological support, smoking cessation, and advice on use of aids \u2013Authors of a cohort study (N = 90 patients with sarcoidosis) in the Netherlands found that a 12-week  individualized exercise prescription and a supervised outpatient physical training program improved exercise tolerance (cycle ergometer test, functional capacity [6MWT], muscle strength [quadriceps, elbow flexors], and perceived health) and lessened fatigue (FAS)(5) -The exercise program included aerobic endurance training and an upper and lower body muscle strengthening program. The patients met with a physical therapist 2 times/week for 60-minute sessions. The aerobic component included an interval program that targeted an exercise intensity levelbetween 13 and 15 on the Borg RPE scale.The strength training included 3 sets of 15\u201320 repetitions for 6\u20138 different exercises with a targeted exercise intensity also between 13 and 15 on the Borg RPE scale",
            "Exercise programs should include aerobic and strength training components that address the patient\u2019s functional capacity and responses to monitored exercise testing (e.g., 6MWT, graded exercise test, strength tests) \u2013Similarresults for inpatient and outpatient programs indicate that the type of setting for pulmonary rehabilitation does not have a significant impact(21)",
            "Ideally, exercise intensity should apply principles of overload, provided that symptoms (i.e., pain, dyspnea) and signs (e.g., SpO2) are within acceptable limits(21)",
            "Monitor HR, BP, RPE, and ask patient to report breathing discomfort level on a regular basis during exercise to ensure levels stay within acceptable limits",
            "Modify the exercise plan if reported fatigue or dyspnea levels become moderately severe or higher",
            "Provide close supervision to ensure safety and effectiveness throughout exercise and functional training sessions .
