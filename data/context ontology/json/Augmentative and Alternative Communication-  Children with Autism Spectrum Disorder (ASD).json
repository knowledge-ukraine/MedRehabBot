            "AAC is a system for communication that supplements or replaces verbal communication (speech) and includes four main components: symbols, aids, techniques, and strategies(1) \u2013Symbols can include objects, drawings, photographs, letters, or words(1) \u2013Aids can be relatively simple or complex devices (e.g., communication boards, electronic devices) for transmitting or receiving messages(1) \u2013Techniques refer to the ways in which the messages are selected for transmission (e.g., direct selection, scanning)(1) \u2013Strategies refer to the methods by which symbols can be conveyed most easily and efficiently(i.e., the most effective way for the individual to combine symbols, aids, and techniques to best communicate)(1)",
            "ASD is a developmental disorder characterized by impairments in development of language, communication, and reciprocal interaction and the presence of repetitive and ritualistic behaviors.(2) Onset occurs before the age of 3 years(3) \u2013Since the 2013 publication of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition  (DSM-5 ), the diagnostic label of ASD encompasses several conditions that were previously considered separate disorders: autistic disorder, pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS),  early infantile autism, atypical autism, Kanner\u2019s autism, high-functioning  autism, childhood disintegrative disorder, and Asperger syndrome (AS).(56) According to the DSM-5 , physicians will now diagnose ASD for patients who exhibit signs and symptoms consistent with any of the aforementioned conditions(56) -Severity levels in ASD: the diagnosing clinician assigns a current severity level with respect to social communication impairments and restrictive, repetitive behaviors(56) -Level 3 \u2013 requiring very substantial support -Level 2 \u2013 requiring substantial support -Level 1 \u2013 requiring support \u2013For detailed information on assessment and treatment of children with ASD, see the series of Clinical Reviews on ASD ",

A sound inventory can be completed for children who have severely limited speech. For specific sounds, the number of omissions, substitutions, distortions, and additions can be calculated. For detailed information on assessment of speech sound disorders, see the series of Clinical Reviews on this topicChildren with severe to profound ASD and ID might be in the early stages of communication. The impact of any motor difficulties should be considered when evaluating the child\u2019s ability to respond to and initiate communication. Early communication can be assessed informally by means of a language sample and observation that document forms (e.g., gesture, vocalizations) and functions of communication (e.g., requests, comments)(20) The CSBS-DP  can be used to assess expressive language, social communication abilities, and symbolic abilities by means of a parent report and directthe Infant-Toddler  Checklist, the Caregiver Questionnaire, and a 30-minute behavior sample of the child. It can be used with all children aged 6 to 24 months and with children up to age 6 years who have a developmental age lower than 24 months(21) Used to assess prelinguistic communication behaviors in individuals with severe developmental and/or physical disabilities. Administered as a questionnaire to be completed by parents, teachers, and therapists. Pragmatic functions that are assessed include social convention, attention to self, rejection/ protestation, request for an object, request for action, request for information, comment, choice making, answer, and imitation(22) Designed to identify how the child currently communicates and assist the assessment team on selecting appropriate communication goals. The assessment covers communication skills that would typically occur from birth to 24 months of age. It can be used for individuals of all ages who are at the earliest stages of communicationAssessment of receptive and expressive language should include a combination of formal and informal measures (language samples)Informal language measures are useful to examine the child\u2019s comprehension of language in different situations, the child\u2019s responsiveness to communication, mean utterance length (MLU), word use/ vocabulary, echolalia, pronoun use, and pragmatics.(5) Informal measures can include observations of the child during home and school instructional and play situations as well as observation during specific elicitation activities. Elicitation measures are used to encourage the child to communicate. The following are some techniques to elicit specific language functions such as requests, comments, and protests for an informal language sample for children -Keep toys away from the child but within sight so that the child needs to request them(5) -Eat a snack in front of the child without offering the food to the child (to elicit requests)(5) -Provide a mystery box or opaque container with objects. When the child withdraws an object, he or she can comment on the object(5) -Engage in social routines (e.g., blowing bubbles) and provide an interruption so that the child can request continuation(5) -Elicit requests of parts of toys or puzzles by offering some but not all of the parts(5) -Pretend to misunderstand or not hear when the child speaks to elicit a conversational repair(5) -Provoke a comment by doing something silly (e.g., wear funny hat) or by pointing to a noteworthy object (e.g., band-aid  on a finger)(5)Comprehensive test batteries for language can be used with children who are able to respond to test questions. The following are examples of comprehensive language evaluations that assess both language comprehension and expression(23) Ages 1 year to 6 years, 11 months(24) Ages 5 years to 16 years, 11 months (has a pragmatic language component)(25) Ages 4 years to 8 years, 11 months (has a pragmatic language component) Children with ASD have difficulty with pragmatic language, including narrative discourse. It is recommended that SLPs use informal language samples or published assessment tools to evaluate pragmatic language. The following are examples of pragmatic tests and screening measures(5)(26) A caregiver-report  rating scale for social and communicative behaviors such as social awareness, social information processing, ability to produce reciprocal social responses, and social use of language. It can be used with children and adolescents (4 years to 18 years)(27) A screening checklist of pragmatic language skills that can be completed by parents and teachers for children and adolescents. The child\u2019s skills can be compared to a norm-referenced  sample(28) A checklist of pragmatic skills based on observation that can be used with both children and adults(29) A measure that provides an inventory of a child\u2019s communication abilities(30) A standardized measure that examines narrative comprehension and production in children aged 5 to 11 yearsRule out or identify the presence of a voice disorderRule out or identify the presence of a fluency disorderProvide a reading evaluation as necessary or refer to a reading specialist/special education teacher. Assessment may include letter identification, letter-sound  identification, phonological awareness skills, sight word reading, fluency, and reading comprehension.

A team approach is recommended in the implementation of AAC; team members typically include SLPs, teachers, the AAC user, and parents/ caregivers. To the greatest extent possible, assessment procedures should be applicable to everyday life(1,9)An ecological inventory can be used to supplement information obtained from interviewsThe purpose of an environmental assessment is to determine the extent of the child\u2019s communication repertoire and social functions with respect to the child\u2019s peers in different environments and activities. The following steps can be used(17) -A peer is observed in a particular setting (e.g., classroom, library, lunch room). The SLP charts the list of communication behaviors that were required for a particular activity (e.g., asking questions, answering yes/no questions, greeting others, requesting objects or activities) -The communication abilities of the child being considered for AAC are compared to those of his/her peers -The child is then provided the AAC support and taught the skills necessary to participate in the activityA child\u2019s knowledge of symbols is typically assessed through dynamic assessment, in which the symbols are taught to the child and then assessed. Symbols include gestures, line drawings, photographs, pictures, traditional orthography, manual signs, etc. Before assessment, a range of concepts that are functional and meaningful for the child are selected to be tested. The highest symbol level that the child is expected to understand is usually tested first to maximize efficiency of assessment. Language tasks that can be used to test symbol knowledge include(17)The evaluator says \u201cShow me\u2026\u201d while presenting multiple symbols to the childThe evaluator asks \u201cIs this a\u2026?\u201d while presenting a symbolThe child is asked to match a symbol to its referentThe child is asked to answer questions using symbols that are availableThe child is given an opportunity to request an item by using a symbolThe child is asked to imitate gestures and actions with specific objects (e.g., pouring tea from a teapot)(18) -The presence of some degree of speech comprehension and comprehension of distal gestures are prognostic indicators of the child\u2019s potential to communicate symbolically using an AAC system(1) -In a study conducted in Japan with 18 children with ASD, researchers found that when a speaker added a pointing cue to eye gaze, this improved referential word mapping in children with ASD(53)The organization of symbols in an aided system should reflect how the child organizes the symbols rather than how the SLP may organize them. Symbols may be arranged taxonomically, alphabetically, schematically, or idiosyncratically (e.g., the child puts \u201cbaseball\u201d with \u201cDad\u201d because he plays baseball with his father). To assess how the child organizes the items, the following tasks can be used(19)The child groups individual vocabulary on different pages or in different boxesThe child is required to match words togetherThe child may trial one organizational system and changes may be made based on the child\u2019s speed, accuracy, and preference in selecting itemsInterviews with the child\u2019s caregivers, teachers, and other communicative partners may identify possible communication barriers that can be resolved. In addition, systematic observation of the child\u2019s interactions, with focus on the communicative partners, can yield information on barriers that may limit the child\u2019s opportunity to communicate. Barriers may include lack of sufficient response time allowed for child, lack of child attention during communicative interactions, and environmental barriers such as presence of loud noises in the classroomNote any difficulties the child may have with motor control that may interfere with social interaction, communication, and use of an AAC system. Children with ASD often have motor impairments such limb apraxia (i.e., difficulty organizing movements in time and space) and involuntary movements.(8) Refer to physical therapist (PT) or occupational therapist (OT) as necessary",

Speech-generating  devices (SGDs) were particularly beneficial for helping individuals with ASD learn how to make requests(67)",
            "Effective and efficient use of AAC occurs with a coordinated effort among teachers, the SLP, family, and AAC user(9,32)",
            "When implementing intervention, the SLP/teacher should consider the child\u2019s preferences and functional motivations(34)",
            "Rather than a single system of communication, the assessment team should identify multiple  methods of communication that the child may use in different situations.(32) Some forms of AAC (e.g., manual signs) are more easily accessed but understood by only some communication partners; voice output communication aids (VOCAs) are more widely understood but might not be available at the moment that the child wants to communicate",
            "Monitoring of the device or system should be ongoing due to the changing needs of the child and the level of required external support(9,32)",
            "Treatment should always be functional, and family-centered  when appropriate. The child should be taught to use the AAC system functionally in diverse settings with different partners.(1) The SLP might be involved in providing direct coaching to parents, siblings, and/or peers regarding the use of the AAC device. Families should always have the opportunity to provide information on their children\u2019s greatest communication needs(32)",
            "The SLP might be involved in instructing teachers/paraeducators or parents on how to use the AAC system with the child. Instruction will vary with the individual\u2019s knowledge but can include the importance of communication, the relationship between behavior and communication, prompting students to use AAC, and how to respond to the child's communicative attempts.(35) Training the child\u2019s communication partner(s) in effective use of AAC is likely to improve the child\u2019s overall communicative success with AAC(54)",
            "Authors who reviewed two studies, one that used the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) and the other that involved use of an SGD, reported improved social outcomes for the child with ASD who used AAC when there was specific peer-mediated  AAC instruction provided.(55) Peer-mediated  strategies for these studies included 1) having an adult facilitate all sessions that involve a typically developing peer and a child with ASD; 2) providing each child with ASD with a typically developing \u201cbuddy\u201d as well as a \u201cbuddy book\u201d with pictures and words; 3) adult\u2013adult  role playing with the AAC for the peer pairs; 4) adult\u2013child  with ASD role play with the AAC; 5) child with ASD\u2013peer  role play with the AAC; 6) adult feedback/reinforcement for the children about communication interactions(55) ",
            "Display presentation considerations \u2013Presentation refers to the organization and layout of the concepts within a display. Variables in presentation include the permanence of the display (i.e., static vs. dynamic display), layout of the display (i.e., grid or visual scene displays), number of representations on the display, size of the symbols, and color organization(36) \u2013In a static display, all symbols can be viewed simultaneously but are limited in number. In a dynamic display, the person can navigate different electronic or nonelectronic pages to find other symbols(36) \u2013Symbols can be displayed on a grid (rows and columns of pictures) or as a visual scene display. A visual scene display contains a picture or photograph with hot spots that allow the user to select items within the scene. For example, a scene could be a kitchen and the user can select an item of food. It is theorized that visual scene displays may reduce cognitive demands in finding and using correct symbols because the symbols are displayed in a contextually meaningful context(36)",
            "Several literature reviews have assessed the effectiveness of AAC for children with ASD \u2013Authors of a review of 12 AAC studies of infants and toddlers with developmental disabilities (190 total participants, 26 with ASD) found that the participants had the ability to use low-technology  methods for early communicative acts such as requesting, commenting, choice making, and protesting. The majority of participants used unaided methods of AAC such as signs, gestures, vocalizations, body movements, and eye gaze shifts. The authors concluded that all studies indicated an improvement in child communication; however, only 7 of 12 studies had adequate methodology to provide conclusive evidence(37) \u2013Authors of a best-evidence  synthesis of research investigated the effects of AAC on speech production of subjects with a range of developmental disabilities (17 total participants that included 4 children with ASD).(38) The authors of the synthesis concluded that AAC intervention resulted in modest gains in speech production for most (89%) of the participants. None of the participants demonstrated a decrease in speech production \u2013Authors of a review of intervention studies involving SGDs for children with ASD (n = 51 children, 3\u201316  years) published from 1998 to 2009 reported that intervention strategies included two main approaches: operant/behavioral techniques and naturalistic teaching procedures. The authors reported positive outcomes for 86% of the studies and found that the majority of studies (78%) had sufficient methodological rigor to provide conclusive evidence.(39) The authors also reported that requesting skills were the most commonly taught and recommended that AAC intervention go beyond requesting skills to more advanced communication skills using SGDs. They also recommended that generalization of skills be taught in different settings with other communication partners(39) \u2013Authors of a review of 56 intervention studies completed from 1980 to 2007 involving the use of AAC for individuals with ASD found that interventions with successful outcomes included those that incorporated sign language/total communication, visual-graphic  symbols, and/or SGDs. Children under the age of 9 made up the majority of participants in the studies (58%)(40) \u2013Authors of a descriptive review of AAC intervention from 1997 to 2003 found that a variety of antecedent and consequence strategies improved AAC communication for children with disabilities. The following are the most common antecedent and consequence strategies in the studies(34) -Antecedent(34) -Prompting: Communication partner uses modeling or gestural, verbal, or physical prompts -Use of multiple stimuli: Relevant materials, such as communication aids, are arranged within reach of the student -Motivation: Partner enhances motivation by following student\u2019s lead and using turn-taking  in a play routine -Embedded instruction: Instruction is embedded in ongoing routines -Temptations: Partner presents some, but not all, of the materials needed to complete a motivating task (e.g., paper but not colors for coloring activity) -Instructor request: The instructor makes a request to the student -Peer mediation: Peers interact with or prompt the student -Consequence(34) -Reinforcement: Communication partner provides specific reinforcement such as responding, fulfilling request for play, or choice of preferred item. An artificial reinforcer, one not related to communication or the task, was used in only 2 of 40 studies -Nonpunitive error correction: Communication partner provides a model and repeats trial, assisting the child \u2013Authors of a literature review of studies on the use of instructional/assistive technology to teach academic skills to students with ASD found only 4 studies that met the \u201cacceptable\u201d quality criteria for the review. Overall, authors report a  low level of evidence for using technology-based  interventions for academic skill training in this population of students. Review authors concluded that technology-based  interventions intended to teach academic skills to students with ASD should be \u201cused with caution\u201d(60)",
            "Types of AAC: AAC typically is categorized into unaided systems of communication and aided systems of communication: \u2013Unaided communication: Unaided approaches to AAC involve using the child\u2019s body to communicate by means of manual signs, gestures, vocalizations, facial expressions, or body movements(37) -Sign language/manual signs: Manual signs may be a primary method of communication or part of a multimodal method of communicating. Even children who may usually use an aided method of communicating may need other methods, such as manual signs, when their electronic or nonelectronic aid is absent or malfunctions(41) -Advantages of sign language/gestures include portability, speed of message preparation, and access to an unlimited number of potential messages. Limitations include the requirement of sufficient fine motor skills to produce the signs; in addition, the signs/gestures need to be recognizable to the communication partner(42) \u2013Aided communication: Aided communication approaches include light-technology  devices and high-technology  devices -Light-technology  systems: Light-technology  AAC refers to nonelectronic external devices such as alphabet boards, symbol-based  topic boards, dry erase boards, and programs such as the PECS (see below for further information)(42) -Advantages of methods such as drawing and a dry-erase board over fixed communication systems such as a communication board are that they can be used in dynamic situations, allowing for expansion and modification of messages(42) -Because light-technology  systems do not have speech output, they require the active participation of the communication partner in interpreting and speaking the words that the child selects; thus, conversations can be highly interactive(42) -Light-technology  systems also allow frequent opportunities for the communication partner to model when the partner supplements spoken output by pointing to the symbol(42) -The success of the interaction depends on the communication partner\u2019s knowledge of the topic, knowledge of the AAC system, and comfort in interacting with the system; thus, it is crucial that communication partners are trained in the use of the particular system with the child(42) -The most intervention research on light-technology systems for children with ASD has been with PECS -PECS is a program that teaches the child to request and to comment by giving picture cards to a communication partner.(43) The communication partner responds by modeling the verbal request and providing the requested item. The child is taught to use PECS by a series of shaping and prompting procedures. Single cards can be used, or cards can be combined into a sequence on a sentence strip and exchanged with the communication partner.(43) For more information on the strategies and the sequence of instructional steps for PECS, see Frost and Bondy, 1996(44) -Authors of a meta-analysis  synthesized the results of group and single-subject  studies that evaluated the effectiveness of the PECS approach on improving speech and overall communication abilities of children with ASD.(45) Researchers concluded that PECS is a promising but not firmly proven practice for promoting communication in children with ASD. At present, there is evidence to support that PECS has small to moderate positive effects on communication; however, there is less evidence to support that it has significant effects on speech development. The authors of this review concluded that more research is needed to assess generalization and maintenance of communication and speech gains -Authors of a review of 8 studies that investigated AAC for children with ASD and comorbid sensory impairment reported on 4 studies that investigated the use of PECS. Communication ability in all participants in 3 of these 4 studies improved using PECS; however, all 4 studies had methodological problems, and review authors recommended further research regarding the effectiveness of PECS in individuals with ASD and comorbid sensory impairments(66) -Two single-group  studies (N = 31, N = 18) conducted in the United States examined the use of PECS to improve functional communication for preschoolers with developmental disabilities. In over half of the participants in both studies PDD-NOS  or ASD was diagnosed.(7) Results of language samples at snack time and free-choice  activities indicated that PECS led to improved functional communication, and improved communication generalized to untrained settings. In addition, 44% of the children demonstrated an increase in spoken language after using PECS -High-technology  systems: High-technology  systems are electronic devices such as SGDs. SGDs have been classified into two main types: devices that allow for formation of new messages and devices that use word or whole-phrase retrieval of prerecorded messages. Caregivers and patients should be involved in selecting the device  -Factors to consider when selecting a device include -Appearance: The assessment team and patient should consider the size, the type of pictures (symbols, photographs), and hardware required (e.g., for classroom use or for use in a variety of environments) -Symbols should be culturally and individually relevant (e.g., if the patient participates in religious activities, options to allow for communication in these situations should be included) -Accessibility and ease of use: Can the patient use the device while holding it at the same time? Can the patient carry the device? -V oice quality: Is the audio clear? Does the patient have any difficulty perceiving the voice? -Effectiveness: Is the device effective for the patient\u2019s needs? -Dynamic screen technology or static display? -Language demands: How are messages composed? Letters, single words, text plus symbols, phrases, sentences, visual scenes? -Universal design is a relatively new concept with respect to assistive technology, including AAC; the idea of universal design is to create devices that serve needs of a wide range of individuals\u2014those with and without disabilities.(64) For example, there are many apps available for download on the iPad that allow it to become a high-tech  AAC device for a child with ASD, but it can also be used by the patient\u2019s parents whose language abilities are intact.(65) For devices with universal design, no adaptations are necessary.(64) The iPad or other commercially available computer tablets also have the advantage of being highly socially acceptable, which is appealing to many parents who do not want their child\u2019s AAC device to appear awkward or stand out -In a study conducted in the United States with5 boys with ASD (mean age of 4.5 years), researchers compared PECS with an iPad-based  SGD to help the children acquire a mand repertoire.(63) Researchers used an alternating treatment design: after the initial baselines, subjects were randomly assigned to begin either PECS or iPad training and were trained in the second form of AAC after the first intervention was complete. The frequency of independent and prompted mands was used as a dependent variable for this study. The interventional mand training was performed in sessions with 15 trials each. In the mand training sessions, a researcher would present the participant with three preferred items and ask the participant to select one. When the participant reached for an item it was then placed out of the child\u2019s reach, but within view, and the PECS or iPad with the picture of the item was placed in front of the child. If the child did not use the AAC to request the item within 5 seconds, the researcher modeled how to do so. Once the child had the preferred item, he was allowed to play with it for 30 seconds and then it was taken back for the next trial. At the conclusion of the study, researchers found that the overall rate of independent manding across training and maintenance intervals was higher for 4 of the 5 participants using the iPad-based  SGD. Individual results varied with respect to obtaining a level of mastery with the device: 2 participants more readily achieved mastery criteria with PECS and 3more readily achieved mastery criteria with the SGD(63)",
            "Functional Communication Training (FCT) and AAC: FCT is often used to address challenging behaviors of children who have difficulty communicating. The purpose of FCT is to replace problem behaviors with more appropriate behaviors that serve the same function. Assessment, or functional analysis, involves identifying the environmental events that are related to the challenging behavior. In a review of FCT intervention studies that utilized AAC (total participants = 52), a variety of AAC techniques were employed in the studies reviewed, with manual signing the most commonly used by participants (37%).(46) Gestures and communication books were taught to 15% of participants. Other AAC techniques included VOCAs, line drawings/photographs, and a Canon Communicator M. FCT resulted in a significant reduction of problem behaviors for the majority of participants (85%). However, studies lacked information on generalization, with only 25% of participants showing generalization of the intervention effects across settings and communication partners. The author concluded that AAC with FCT is most effective when the behaviors are efficient, recognizable by others, and learned in natural settings with distributed practice trials(46)",
            "Facilitated communication: In the 1990s, facilitated communication was promoted by some researchers as a method for circumventing expressive language difficulties of individuals with ASD. The \u201cfacilitator\u201d assisted a nonverbal person (communicator) to indicate letters, words, phrases, or sentences on a computer, typewriter, or alphabet board by using manual prompting to support the communicator\u2019s hand in selecting the letters or phrases. Multiple research studies have found that there is no scientific evidence that this method is effective or valid; blind studies in which the facilitators are asked different questions than the patients demonstrate that facilitators often unintentionally select messages for patients rather than assist patients in creating their own messages(47,48) See Description , Indications of device/equipment , and Guidelines for use of device/equipment , above  .
