            "Hemophilia is a group of bleeding disorders characterized by factor VIII (F8) or factor IX ( F9) coagulant deficiency. Hemophilia A ( F8 gene deficiency) and hemophilia B ( F9 gene deficiency) are X-linked  recessive disorders that are clinically indistinguishable but can be differentiated by factor assay testing. Hemophilia A is the more common form. Hemophilia is classified by the severity of the factor deficiency based on the results of the factor VIII/IX assay(1)",

Deficiencies in either one of these factors impair thecoagulation pathway such that the platelet plug is inadequately stabilized, leading to impaired homeostasis and excessivebleeding(1)",
            "Pathogenesis of complications of hemophilia\u2013Acute hemorrhage-Can be caused by direct trauma, underlying abnormal biomechanical factors such as muscle strength/muscle lengthimbalances, or loss of ROM, all of which predispose the muscle to abnormal shear or torsional forces that can result inmicrotrauma and intramuscular bleeding(6)-Following a hemorrhage, there is a short period of severe pain followed by decreased ROM and strength around the jointand increased joint volume, resulting primarily from the increase in intraarticular pressure and inflammation(4,7)-When the bleeding episode stops, red blood cells begin to break down. Scavenger cells within the synovium remove thedebris and the synovium becomes laden with iron and other blood waste products. These waste products begin to attackand damage the smooth surfaces of the cartilage. Within 3-4 weeks, the blood will be broken down and the fluid withinthe joint reabsorbed by the synovium(4,8)\u2013Target joints-After repetitive bleeding episodes within the same joint, the joint may be unable to recover to baseline between bleeds.The loss of ROM and muscle function remains as long as the repetitive bleeding occurs. The joint eventually developsa \u201cboggy\u201d appearance. Cartilage becomes frayed and pitted, creating increased friction in the joint. The synoviumbecomes thickened and palpable, leading to hemophilic synovitis. The joint is now labeled a target joint, and this state isknown as chronic synovitis(4,8)-In the most severe cases, the bones become fused, resulting in a completely disabled (swollen and distorted) joint thatgreatly impacts the functional mobility and daily lifestyle(5)\u2013Chronic synovitis and arthropathy as a result of hemophilia(5,8,9)-Chronic inflammation often leads to chronic synovitis and/or arthritis, known as hemophilic arthropathy-The progression from recurrent hemarthrosis to arthropathy is incompletely understood, but it is characterized byinflammatory synovitis and cartilage destruction-Hemosiderin deposition into synovial tissues induces proliferation of the synovium and neovascularization of thesub-synovial  layer, resulting in hypertrophied, inflamed, and villous synovial tissue. This friable and highly vascularsynovium is more susceptible to further hemorrhage with only minimal stress-Chronic synovitis of a target joint can be diagnosed when the following signs and symptoms are present:-Chronic joint swelling for > 3 months that does not respond to factor replacement therapy-An increase in bleeding frequency in the affected joint-Joint instability-Hemophilic arthropathy is characterized by synovial hypertrophy, cartilage damage, narrowing of the joint space, andchanges in bone structure most commonly affecting the knees, elbows, and ankles, resulting in progressive muscularweakness, muscle atrophy, and further loss of ROM(8)-The number of hemorrhaging episodes required to cause irreversible damage of the articular cartilage is unknown andvaries from individual to individual(5)\u2013Pseudotumor syndrome(6,10)-The local pathophysiology that results in the encapsulation of a hematoma remains unclear, but most authors agree thatthe lesion begins with a hematoma that is untreated or there is failure of complete reabsorption of the hematoma.

If in doubt of a bleed, physicians should proceed with treatment intervention(27) Recombinant factor replacement concentrates are widely used, and became the first choice for treatment since the early 1990s. They significantly reduce the risk of transmitting infectious agents such as HIV and hepatitis A and B that can be present in plasmaderived products.(5) Due to advances in purification, more plasma-derived  products are being used(1) Immune tolerance induction therapy may be initiated to eliminate the inhibitors for patients with severe hemophilia who develop factor inhibitors Immune tolerance induction consists of giving factor replacement combined with immunosuppressive agents until inhibitors are no longer detectable. Immune tolerance therapy should continue as long as the inhibitor titer is decreasing but should be terminated if there is no change over a 6month period Prophylaxis regimens for adults are typically reviewed at least every 6-12 months, and a dose reduction may be considered if no bleeding has occurred(1,5) Long-term  prophylaxis is considered for those with advanced arthropathy if recurrent bleeding episodes are interfering with work or mobility. Secondary prophylaxis can decrease total bleeding, hemarthrosis episodes, and total missed days of school or work Barriers to primary prophylaxis include cost and the need for frequent venous access with a central venous line or arteriovenous fistulae In a comparison of outcomes over 22 years in two countries, researchers concluded that Dutch patients treated primarily with prophylaxis presented with fewer joint bleeds per year and had better clinical joint scores and less arthropathy than French patients treated primarily on demand(18) Authors of a 6-year  multicenter study involving 477 patients with severe hemophilia A from the U.S., Europe, and Japan demonstrated that patients on prophylaxis (regular infusion of factor concentrates for > 46 weeks per year) had fewer bleeding episodes, better baseline and final examination scores, significantly less progression of xray  changes, fewer days lost from school/work, and less time hospitalized(18)",

They may be at a higher risk for injury and potentially life-threatening  bleeds than with their peers, but the physical, social, and psychological benefits associated with appropriate sport may outweigh the increased risks(2,3,12) \u2013Participation in sports contributes to the development of self-esteem,  confidence, independence, peer relationships, and quality of life \u2013Sports promote improve coordination, strength, flexibility, and physical fitness, which in the long term protects the joints and prevents bleeds \u2013Activities that place an individual at greater risk for head injury should be avoided; encourage noncontact sports such as racket sports and swimming \u2013Factors to consider when determining which sport an individual can play include age, severity of hemophilia, medical history, treatment regimen, and level of competition. The decision should always be based on the individual\u2019s functional status(12) \u2013In 1990, the National Hemophilia Foundation-American Pediatric Society divided sports and activities into 3 categories on the basis of risk with a preference towards activities that are \u201cnon-contact  sports.\u201d However, more recently, sports are being assessed based on biomechanical aspects, risk of injury, and level of difficulty learning the sport(12) -Category 1: Sports in which most individuals with hemophilia can safely participate (golf, cycling, swimming, walking, Frisbee) -Category 2: Basketball, mountain biking, rowing, cross-country  skiing -Category 3: Activities in which the risks outweigh the benefits and often pose a greater risk of injury to all individuals (football, rugby, hockey, wrestling) \u2013International sports-injury  statistics may be reviewed when determining which sport a patient with hemophilia can safely participate in and how modifying the sport can reduce the risk of injury(12) -Examples of the sports analysis -Seventy-one  percent of softball-related injuries result from base sliding. Curtailing or eliminating sliding would significantly reduce the risk of injury "

        "treatment summary": [
            "Physical therapy plays an integral role in all stages of rehabilitation of patients with hemophilia. Preoperative rehabilitation aims to optimize the patient\u2019s strength and functional level prior to surgical intervention in an effort to reduce postoperative recovery. Postoperative rehabilitation is seen as a relatively safe for the patient to actively participate in rehabilitation and maximize functional recovery. Physical therapy should be timed to coincide with factor replacement therapy to minimize the risk of bleeding(5,11,15,21,27) \u2013Key components that should be considered when treating patients after a total knee replacement are: early knee ROM for both flexion and extension with the goal of minimizing a knee extensor lag, passive manual techniques, and open kinetic chain and isometric exercises. A continuous passive mobilization (CPM) machine may be ordered by the physician and may be helpful in the early, postoperative stage. Partial weight-bearing  gait training should be initiated 2 days after surgery(21) \u2013Outpatient physical therapy should focus on gait training, balance, ROM, muscle strengthening (open and then closed kinetic chain), cryotherapy, and hydrotherapy(21) \u2013Postoperative treatment intervention for patients undergoing total shoulder arthroplasty emphasizes restoring rotator cuff and scapular strength and stability in conjunction with improving shoulder ROM and function. Interscalene blocks for postoperative pain management are effective",
            "A physical therapy educational intervention performed every 2 weeks combined with home exercises carried out once a day for 6 days a week over a 15-week  period was found to be superior to a control group in improving the perception of pain in patients with hemophilic arthropathy of the ankle(35) \u2013Based on a randomized controlled trial conducted in Spain with 20 patients with hemophilia \u2013Outcome measures were the following: -Joint status \u2013 Gilbert scale -Pain \u2013 visual analog scale -Illness behavior was evaluated using the Illness Behavior Questionnaire -Perception of the quality of life was evaluated using the A36 Hemophilia-QoL  questionnaire \u2013The intervention also improved some variables in the perception of the quality of life and illness behavior",
            "It can be beneficial for the patient to be evaluated by a physical therapist prior to initiating a competitive sports program so that the patient\u2019s flexibility, strength, endurance, and sport-specific training can be properly assessed in order to minimize the risk of injury(2)",
            "Physical therapy treatment intervention is often prescribed in conjunction with prophylactic therapy. Strengthening the muscles around the involved joints may prevent abnormal loading and therefore reduce the risk of future joint deformity and enhance joint function. In addition, stretching increases flexibility and may reduce the risk of injury(14,24) \u2013Researchers in the U. S.conducted a randomized controlled study with 13 subjects in the control group compared to 33 in the exercise group(24) -Exercise group participated in self-selected  physical activity for 30 minutes at least 3 times a week based on a subjective report. Activities included weight training, yoga, swimming, biking, hiking, martial arts, basketball, and golf -Goniometric measurements were taken for bilateral hip extension and flexion, knee flexion and extension, ankle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion, shoulder flexion, and elbow flexion and extension -Subjects in the exercise group had statistically significant gains in overall joint ROM (11 measurements). The mean overall gain was +3\u00b0 for the exercise group compared to 0\u00b0 for the nonexercise group \u2013Progression of physical therapy must be gradual and based on individual clinical findings. Typical treatment progression:(14) -Isometric exercises within the limits of discomfort and joint range beginning as soon as hemostasis is achieved -Isotonic exercises without weights -Isotonic exercised with weights (graded progression) -Dynamic exercises with increasing load, using concentric and eccentric contraction -Dynamic isokinetic training with various resistances brought in gradually as part of strength training -In addition to a strength training progression, flexibility exercises and proprioception training starts as soon as practical and continued for several months (especially after ankle and knee synovitis) -Flexibility exercises ",
            "Researchers of a 2007 systematic review of literature on physical exercise and sports in individuals with hemophilia receiving prophylaxis and on-demand  treatment suggest that improving strength and joint proprioception through regular, varied exercise may help reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes as well as improve overall quality of life(3) \u2013Search process identified only 9 studies that met the researchers\u2019 inclusion criteria and specifically indicated the type of exercise that the patients were doing during the experimentation period \u2013Several studies found an association between patients\u2019 degenerative joint processes with lack of physical activity and exercise. Decreased physical activity was found to be associated with a higher risk of muscle and joint impairments and increased difficulty performing daily activities",
            "Most hemorrhages do not necessitate full withdrawal from all forms of activity. To prevent chronic synovitis and the development of a target joint, physical therapy must be initiated as soon as possible following the identification of a hemorrhage. Early physical therapy intervention should focus on maintaining cardiovascular fitness, strength, and flexibility of the unaffected areas of the body while enabling recovery to the area of the hemorrhage. Failure to provide this intervention could lead to a cycle of inactivity, deconditioning, and further joint injury(5,11,15) \u2013In the presence of an acute hemarthrosis, pain management is very important. Initiate PRICE protocol and immobilize the affected joint with splints/orthotics in a loose packed position while the patient receives factor replacement to prevent further bleeding. Assistive devices are often needed. Gentle isometrics and PROM may be initiated to aid in the reabsorption of the blood and help prevent muscle atrophy(8) \u2013Once pain subsides, and the bleeding has stopped, progress from isometrics and AROM to isotonics and then isokinetics in conjunction with proprioceptive training, stretching, and functional exercises(8,10) \u2013Patients should be encouraged to return to school or work without putting stress on the affected joint. This can be accomplished with assistive devices, as indicated (e.g., wheelchair, crutches, sling). Care should be taken not to overburden the other joints(11) \u2013For chronic synovitis, intensive daily muscle strengthening should be combined with splinting, as long as there is muscle weakness and instability, and with cold application for 20 minutes several times a day. Risk of recurrent bleeding is very low and good results have been documented \u2013The primary goal is pain reduction and joint protection in the presence of a hemarthrosis. Manual traction and translation may be beneficial. Once pain is significantly reduced, functional exercises should begin",
            "Hydrotherapy may be beneficial in treating painful or hypomobile joints, hematomas, chronic arthropathy, chronic synovitis, or following an acute hemarthrosis or surgical correction such as total joint replacement by providing pain relief; reducing muscle spasms; increasing ROM, strength, and exercise endurance; and improving circulation, balance, coordination, posture, and joint proprioception(8,11,25) \u2013Researchers in Spain investigated the use of a 9-week  aquatic training program (1 hour, 3 times a week) in 9 adults (mean age 32 years) with hemophilia A(25) -Twenty-seven  customized aquatic training sessions over a 3-phase  program, which included a warm-up  and relaxation/cool-down.  Muscular endurance exercises required 20 repetitions and strengthening exercises included two 30-second  sessions per exercise with a 2-minute  rest per exercise -There were significant improvements in aerobic capacity, oxygen uptake, and mechanical capacity compared to pre-aquatic  therapy measurements without causing any adverse effects",
            "Balance and sensorimotor retraining: Australian researchers evaluated the effectiveness of an individualized balance and strength training home program in 12 adults with hemophilia and other bleeding disorders (mean age of 39 years)(19) \u2013Functional Reach Test, step test, TUG test, timed sit to stand, quadriceps strength, pain, physical activity level (Human Activity Profile), fear of falling (Modified Falls Efficacy Scale), in conjunction with the NeuroCom Balance Master system, which measured a modified clinical test of sensory interaction on balance (mCTSIB), limits of stability (LOS), and gait were evaluated initially and then 4 months after completion of the exercise program \u2013A physiotherapist initially assessed the subjects and instructed each patient in his or her own customized home exercise program including 6-8 exercises (balance, lower limb strengthening, and walking). They were given an exercise diary and asked to do their home program 5-7 days a week for 4 months, and 2 scheduled reassessments with the physiotherapist took place at 6 and 12 weeks \u2013There were gains of 5-22%  on 10 of the 16 measures, but they were not statistically significant. There was a 40% dropout rate during this study (12/20 completed)",
            "Electrical stimulation may be used to increase strength and decrease muscle atrophy(16,20,26) \u2013Based on a controlled study in Spain of 15 adults with severe hemophilia(16)  -Subjects participated in a surface electrical stimulation program 3 times a week for 35 minutes per session at a frequency of 45Hz, pulse 200\u00b5s, 10 seconds on/10 seconds off over an 8-week  period on the biceps brachii of both arms. Participants voluntarily selected the intensity of the impulse and were encouraged to gradually increase the intensity -There were significant increases in muscle diameter, isometric force, and EMG activity of the biceps brachii in both arms and no significant changes for the control group \u2013Based on a controlled study in Spain of 10 adults (mean age 36 years) with severe hemophilia(26) -Subjects received surface electrical stimulation to the left quadriceps femoris for 30 minutes a day, 3 days a week for 6 weeks at 45 Hz with pulse of 300 \u00b5s, and 12 seconds on/8 seconds off. Participants voluntarily selected the intensity of the impulse and were encouraged to gradually increase it -There were increases in isometric quadriceps femoris strength and muscle diameter compared to the control group",
            "Depending on the location and severity of the bleeding, immobilization with slings, splints, or casts may be necessary(4) \u2013Rigid immobilization protects the joint from injury but decreases joint motion and proprioception, weakens muscles, reduces nutrition to the articular cartilage, and increases stress on adjacent joints. If prescribed, rigid immobilization should be used for very short periods to allow an acute joint to heal but minimize the risk of affecting adjacent joints. Splints are preferred over circumferential plaster casts(27) \u2013Air-stirrup  splints may be recommended to limit inversion sprains, but other splints that support the ankle and limit excessive dorsiflexion or plantar flexion may be more appropriate \u2013Elastic support braces that provide joint compression may assist with controlling joint swelling while providing additional joint proprioception .

        "It is important for a patient\u2019s general health and joint status to be monitored on a regular basis. Recommendations are for a complete hematologic, musculoskeletal, and psychosocial assessment by all core team members every 3-6 months the first year, then once to twice a year after that. This should include a thorough musculoskeletal evaluation by a physical therapist, an inhibitor screen, liver function tests, and test for antibodies to hepatitis viruses and HIV(1,9,27)",
        "All patients should be vaccinated against hepatitis A and B. Consider immunization with inactivated hepatitis A vaccine because contaminated clotting factor concentrates have been identified. Vaccinations should be subcutaneous rather than intramuscular or intradermally, unless covered by infusion of clotting factor concentrates(27)",

        "If surgical intervention is required, preoperative assessment should include inhibitor screening and inhibitor assay. Patients should be rescreened 4-12weeks postoperatively",
        "Maximizing the patient\u2019s strength, flexibility, endurance, and associated joint stability through an ongoing strength and conditioning program may reduce the frequency of hemarthrosis and progression of arthropathy(3,14,15,24)",
        "Regular participation in physical activity which includes with muscle strengthening, coordination, aerobic conditioning, and maintaining a healthy body weight is important for long-term  management of hemophilia. Encourage family participation, which promotes positive social reinforcement(27) Individuals with hemophilia who exercise regularly exhibit fewer bleeds and have strength and daily functional abilities matching their peers who do not have hemophilia(5) 30-60  minutes of daily exercise to prevent the progression of arthropathy(5,11,15) Increased fitness levels may improve to the ability to participate in family activities and therefore lessen the impact of the psychosocial aspects of the disease Regular physical activity may provide additional benefits, including improved body composition and improved self-esteem, and may also reduce risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, osteoporosis, and certain cancers(15) Maintaining a fitness journal to monitor compliance with a home strengthening and fitness program often increases the rate of success(15) Target joints can be protected with braces or splints during activity(5,27)",
