The patient might exhibit reflexive movements with repeated vigorous sensory stimuli(1,2,32) \u2013There is a complete loss of spontaneous or stimulus-induced arousal.(32) While in a coma, the patient is unarousable; however, he or she might exhibit some reflexive movements(1)",

Some feel that the term is pejorative, as it bears similarity to the word \u201cvegetable\u201d; others feel that the term conflates consciousness and behavioral responsiveness.(32)Because the term vegetative state is sometimes viewed as pejorative, and clinicians might feel uncomfortable referring to a patient in this way, the term UWS was introduced into the literature, and the state is sometimes referred to as VS/UWS(36)",

Authors recommended multiple administrations of the CRS-R over many different times of day(47) T709271 -Coma/Near-Coma  Scale (CNC) (recommended, with major reservations)(3) -Disorders of Consciousness Scale (DOCS)(recommended, with moderate reservations)(3) -A standardized assessment with 23 test items; each item is rated on a 3-point  rating scale(8,13) -0 = No response; response does not differ from baseline behavior; 1 = General response; 2 = Localized response; response is contextually related to the test stimuli -SLPs can perform the DOCS to measure the level of fluctuating cognition for patients in states of disordered consciousness.
