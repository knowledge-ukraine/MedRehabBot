            "The Test of Infant Motor Performance (TIMP) is a predictive, discriminative, and evaluative norm-referenced  assessment tool that examines postural and selective control of movement needed for functional gross motor performance in infants.(2,19) The TIMP can be used by physical therapists (PTs), occupational therapists (OTs), and other healthcare specialists who work in early intervention to evaluate posture and movement of infants born at 34 weeks postconceptional age (PCA) through 4 months of gestational age (GA) or corrected age (CA).

Test-retest  reliability was high (r = 1.00; ICC = 1.00)(25) -Validity -Construct and content validity -Researchers of a study conducted in the United States found that the TIMP and the Bayley III motor composite have a correlation of 0.546; however, the correlation between the TIMP and the Bayley cognitive composite and Bayley language composite was lower (0.310 and 0.281)(18) -One hundred forty-five  infants born at 29 to 34 weeks GA with socioenvironmental risk factors were included in this study -Despite the correlation of the Bayley III with the TIMP, no child in this moderate-risk  group was identified as delayed by the Bayley III scale at 6 weeks CA -Researchers recommended that for assessment of motor performance and determination of the need for intervention at very early ages in infants at risk, the TIMP,not the Bayley III, should be the preferred test -Researchers of a study conducted in the United States found that abnormal white matter as measured by MRI was correlated to abnormal scores on the TIMP in infants as young as 3 months post-term(22) -Abnormal white matter was characterized by volume loss, thinning, cysts, or ventricular dilation -Abnormal white matter also correlated with abnormal general movements as measured bythe General Movement Assessment test -Authors of a study (N = 655 infants from Brazil) investigated the psychometric properties of the Portuguese version of the TIMP for use in infants in Brazil. They found the test had high test-item  construct validity(23) -Authors of a study (N = 655 infants from Brazil between 34 weeks postmenstrual age and 17weeksCA) who investigated the reliability and construct, content, and criterion validity of the TIMP for infants from Brazil found high content validity (ICC0.74 to 0.100(25) -Concurrent validity -Researchers in the Netherlands conducted a study to compare the TIMP to the AIMS in the ability to predict gross motor development and independent walking in infants born very preterm (< 30 weeks GA)(17) -A correlation was made between TIMP and AIMS raw scores of 0.82 and between TIMP and AIMS z-scores  of 0.71 -Neither TIMP nor AIMS scores at 3 months CA were associated with gross motor outcome at 15 months CA -AIMS scores at 6 months CA predicted the AIMS scores at 15 months CA with an explained variance of 19% -Researchers concluded that neither the TIMP nor the AIMS was able to predict gross motor development at 15 months CA and independent walking prior to 6 months CA -Authors of a study (N = 655 infants from Brazil between 34 weeks postmenstrual age and 17 weeks CA) who investigated the reliability and construct, content, and criterion validity of the TIMP for infants from Brazil found the concurrent validityto be low in the first months and weak to moderate at 3\u20134 months when compared with the AIMS(25) -Evaluative validity/responsiveness -Authors of a systematic review of neonatal assessments for preterm infants up to 4 months CA found that the TIMP had the best evaluative validity of the 8 neonatal assessments that met the inclusion criteria for the review. The 8 neonatal assessments that met the criteria were the Assessment of Preterm Infants\u2019 Behavior (APIB), Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Network Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS), TIMP, Prechtl\u2019s Assessment of General Movements (GMs), Neurobehavioral Assessment of the Preterm Infant (NAPI), Dubowitz Neurological Assessment of the Preterm and Full-Term  Infant, Neuromotor Behavioral Assessment (NMBA), and the Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS)(10)  -Discriminative validity -Researchers of a retrospective study conducted in the United States examined the discriminative validity of the TIMP and found that it was more sensitive at 8 weeks CA than at 13 weeks; however, the authors noted that this result contradicted the results of previous research studies, which found the opposite(11) -Authors of a study (N = 655 infants from Brazil between 34 weeks postmenstrual age and 17 weeks CA) who investigated the reliability and construct, content, and criterion validity of the TIMP for infants from Brazil foundthat the TIMP discriminated typical and non-typical  motor behaviors in infants from Brazil(25) -Predictive validity -United States researchers evaluated the ability of the TIMP to predict infant scores on the AIMS at 6, 9, and 12 months of age; researchers found that an infant\u2019s TIMP score at 3 months of age had the greatest predictive value for future performance when tested with the AIMS at 12 months of age(9) -Ninety-six  infants born from 32 weeks PCA to 4 months post-term  were included in the study -Infants were tested at 7, 30, 60, and 90 days after term age -Researchers of a follow-up  research study conducted in the United States examined infants\u2019 TIMP scores at 7, 30, 60, and 90 days post-term  to assess the ability of the TIMP to predict PDMS-2 total motor scores at 4 and 5 years of age; researchers found that the 90-day  TIMP score was the most sensitive for predicting future performance on the PDMS-2(12) -Sixty-one  children from an original cohort of 90 infants participated in this follow-up study -Authors of a study (N = 106 infants born earlier than 31 weeks GA) investigated the relationship between the TIMP at 3 months and cognitive, language, and motor outcomes on the Bayley III at 2 years of age in high-risk  infants born preterm(24) -The TIMP z-scores  at 10\u201315  weeks of age were significantly associated with all three subscales on the Bayley\u2010III at 2 years of age ( p < 0.001). Using a TIMP z\u2010score cutoff of \u22120.5, specificity was relatively high for cognitive (87%), language (88%), and motor (89%) outcomes, but sensitivity was low (cognitive 41%, language 49%, motor 57%) -While the TIMP is a measure of motor integrity, it is also predictive of cognitive and language outcomes -Authors of a study (N = 655 infants from Brazil between 34 weeks postmenstrual age and 17 weeks CA) investigated the reliability and construct, content, and criterion validity of the TIMP for infants from Brazil found that infants assessed with motor difficulties in the first days of life had the same challenges after 20 and 40 days, and therefore were in need of intervention. The TIMP can predict developmental delays within small intervals(25) -Sensitivity:  Sensitivity of 92%(9) -In a 2011 study conducted in South Korea, researchers evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of the TIMP as an assessment tool for infant development -Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curve analysis was performed to evaluate the TIMP for screening infant motor development. ROC analysis showed areas under the curve of 0.825 in the physical index and 0.992 in the mental index on the Bayley III, indicating that the TIMP is an excellent tool for screening infant motor development -Seventy-six  preterm and term infants were recruited from a NICU and tested with the TIMPat their initial visit and at 6 months after the original test date -Researchers recommended that the TIMP be used as a reliable screening tool for neonates and infants < 4 months of age in South Korea instead of the more commonly used tools, the Denver Developmental Screening Test and Bayley III -Internal consistency:  Internal consistency coefficient of 0.98(1) -Authors of a study (N = 655 infants from Brazil) investigated psychometric properties ofthePortuguese version of the TIMP for use on infants in Brazil. They found the TIMP had high internal consistency(23) -Ceiling/floor Effects: -Authors of a study (N = 655 infants from Brazil) investigated psychometric properties of the Portuguese version of the TIMP for use on infants in Brazil. They found the TIMP had no ceiling or floor effects (23) \u2013Time to complete test:  The TIMP takes 25\u201340 minutes to administer depending on the child\u2019s abilities, behavioral state, physiological stability, and level of cooperation;(19) average time to complete is 33 minutes(1) -The TIMPSI was developed as a screening tool to determine which infants should take the TIMP, as the TIMP can be demanding on the youngest and most fragile infants(21)  \u2013Potential complications/side effects:  Researchers of one research study conducted in the United States found that some test items can cause infant irritability due to overall muscle weakness in infants with SMA type 1(7) \u2013Test preparation/materials required -Test authors recommend that PTs and OTs receive specific training in administration of the TIMP prior to administering it(2) -Infant Motor Performance Scales, LLC offers an online learning program for the TIMP. The program has 9 learning modules featuring lectures by the designers of the TIMP and other workshop instructors, videos of the TIMP in action, and opportunities for the learner to assess their comprehension of the material and score test-item video clips(13) -Infant Motor Performance Scales, LLC offers TIMP approved in-person  workshops in the United States and China. The 2-day  workshops are taught by certified instructors(13) -Examiners administering the TIMP should be fully trained and qualified to handle, examine, and care for infants(2) -Materials required to complete the TIMP -A rattle with a soft (not sharp or harsh) sound (e.g., maraca toys, plastic eggs or boxes filled with popcorn or rice)(2) -Any item used during the TIMP should not be used as a toy for the infant; these items should only be used for testing purposes(2) -A squeaky object with a soft (but not whispery or harsh) sound (many 4\u20135\u201d  dog toys can be used; however, latex toys should be avoided due to potential allergies)(2) -A shiny red ball approximately 55 mm, or 2 inches, in diameter(2) -An age calculation wheel that allows for automatic calculation of CA or chronologic age up to 18 weeks post-term  to accurately compare performance against age expectations from the TIMP and TIMPSI normative studies(2) \u2013Test procedure -Instructions for administration are included with the TIMP test kit(1) -The clinician administering the TIMP first observes the infant\u2019s behaviors, then elicits specific behaviors according to standardized procedures outlined by the test administration manual(3) -Items on the test include postural change, antigravity movement, adaptation to handling, visual reaction, auditory reaction, interaction with caregiver, and head and body control(15) \u2013Test scoring/interpretation -The 13 observed items are scored \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d(1) -A yes answer is equal to 1 point; a no answer is worth 0 points(1) -The 29 elicited items involve having the administering clinician handle the infant, place the infant in various positions, and document the infant\u2019s response to visual or auditory stimuli(1) -The instructions for the elicited items have pictures with a text description of the infant position, test procedure, and scoring criteria(1) -The elicited items have scoring options from 0 to 3, 0 to 4, 0 to 5, or 0 to 6; certain items are scored for both the left and right(1) -A total raw score ranges from 0 to 142.(19) The total raw score is calculated from the subtotal for the observed items and a subtotal for the elicited items; the clinician can use the chart in the manual to convert the raw score to the final TIMP score for the corresponding age group(1) -Score sheets allow for plotting the infant\u2019s scores against percentile ranks, which provide an age-equivalent  score(19) -Higher total score indicates better motor development and can be an early indication of motor developmental delay or atypical motor function in infants -The authors of the TIMP suggest a \u20130.5 standard deviation below the mean for identifying infants who may require close monitoring and/or referral for early intervention services(19) \u2013Test follow-up:  Developmental assessments such as the TIMP should be repeated frequently to document both age-related  and intervention-related  changes, document progression toward goals, and assist with more accurately predicting future motor skills/need for continued intervention(9)  References 1.Campbell SK.

Test-retest  reliability was high (r = 1.00; ICC = 1.00)(25) -Validity -Construct and content validity -Researchers of a study conducted in the United States found that the TIMP and the Bayley III motor composite have a correlation of 0.546; however, the correlation between the TIMP and the Bayley cognitive composite and Bayley language composite was lower (0.310 and 0.281)(18) -One hundred forty-five  infants born at 29 to 34 weeks GA with socioenvironmental risk factors were included in this study -Despite the correlation of the Bayley III with the TIMP, no child in this moderate-risk  group was identified as delayed by the Bayley III scale at 6 weeks CA -Researchers recommended that for assessment of motor performance and determination of the need for intervention at very early ages in infants at risk, the TIMP,not the Bayley III, should be the preferred test -Researchers of a study conducted in the United States found that abnormal white matter as measured by MRI was correlated to abnormal scores on the TIMP in infants as young as 3 months post-term(22) -Abnormal white matter was characterized by volume loss, thinning, cysts, or ventricular dilation -Abnormal white matter also correlated with abnormal general movements as measured bythe General Movement Assessment test -Authors of a study (N = 655 infants from Brazil) investigated the psychometric properties of the Portuguese version of the TIMP for use in infants in Brazil. They found the test had high test-item  construct validity(23) -Authors of a study (N = 655 infants from Brazil between 34 weeks postmenstrual age and 17weeksCA) who investigated the reliability and construct, content, and criterion validity of the TIMP for infants from Brazil found high content validity (ICC0.74 to 0.100(25) -Concurrent validity -Researchers in the Netherlands conducted a study to compare the TIMP to the AIMS in the ability to predict gross motor development and independent walking in infants born very preterm (< 30 weeks GA)(17) -A correlation was made between TIMP and AIMS raw scores of 0.82 and between TIMP and AIMS z-scores  of 0.71 -Neither TIMP nor AIMS scores at 3 months CA were associated with gross motor outcome at 15 months CA -AIMS scores at 6 months CA predicted the AIMS scores at 15 months CA with an explained variance of 19% -Researchers concluded that neither the TIMP nor the AIMS was able to predict gross motor development at 15 months CA and independent walking prior to 6 months CA -Authors of a study (N = 655 infants from Brazil between 34 weeks postmenstrual age and 17 weeks CA) who investigated the reliability and construct, content, and criterion validity of the TIMP for infants from Brazil found the concurrent validityto be low in the first months and weak to moderate at 3\u20134 months when compared with the AIMS(25) -Evaluative validity/responsiveness -Authors of a systematic review of neonatal assessments for preterm infants up to 4 months CA found that the TIMP had the best evaluative validity of the 8 neonatal assessments that met the inclusion criteria for the review. The 8 neonatal assessments that met the criteria were the Assessment of Preterm Infants\u2019 Behavior (APIB), Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Network Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS), TIMP, Prechtl\u2019s Assessment of General Movements (GMs), Neurobehavioral Assessment of the Preterm Infant (NAPI), Dubowitz Neurological Assessment of the Preterm and Full-Term  Infant, Neuromotor Behavioral Assessment (NMBA), and the Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS)(10)  -Discriminative validity -Researchers of a retrospective study conducted in the United States examined the discriminative validity of the TIMP and found that it was more sensitive at 8 weeks CA than at 13 weeks; however, the authors noted that this result contradicted the results of previous research studies, which found the opposite(11) -Authors of a study (N = 655 infants from Brazil between 34 weeks postmenstrual age and 17 weeks CA) who investigated the reliability and construct, content, and criterion validity of the TIMP for infants from Brazil foundthat the TIMP discriminated typical and non-typical  motor behaviors in infants from Brazil(25) -Predictive validity -United States researchers evaluated the ability of the TIMP to predict infant scores on the AIMS at 6, 9, and 12 months of age; researchers found that an infant\u2019s TIMP score at 3 months of age had the greatest predictive value for future performance when tested with the AIMS at 12 months of age(9) -Ninety-six  infants born from 32 weeks PCA to 4 months post-term  were included in the study -Infants were tested at 7, 30, 60, and 90 days after term age -Researchers of a follow-up  research study conducted in the United States examined infants\u2019 TIMP scores at 7, 30, 60, and 90 days post-term  to assess the ability of the TIMP to predict PDMS-2 total motor scores at 4 and 5 years of age; researchers found that the 90-day  TIMP score was the most sensitive for predicting future performance on the PDMS-2(12) -Sixty-one  children from an original cohort of 90 infants participated in this follow-up study -Authors of a study (N = 106 infants born earlier than 31 weeks GA) investigated the relationship between the TIMP at 3 months and cognitive, language, and motor outcomes on the Bayley III at 2 years of age in high-risk  infants born preterm(24) -The TIMP z-scores  at 10\u201315  weeks of age were significantly associated with all three subscales on the Bayley\u2010III at 2 years of age ( p < 0.001). Using a TIMP z\u2010score cutoff of \u22120.5, specificity was relatively high for cognitive (87%), language (88%), and motor (89%) outcomes, but sensitivity was low (cognitive 41%, language 49%, motor 57%) -While the TIMP is a measure of motor integrity, it is also predictive of cognitive and language outcomes -Authors of a study (N = 655 infants from Brazil between 34 weeks postmenstrual age and 17 weeks CA) investigated the reliability and construct, content, and criterion validity of the TIMP for infants from Brazil found that infants assessed with motor difficulties in the first days of life had the same challenges after 20 and 40 days, and therefore were in need of intervention. The TIMP can predict developmental delays within small intervals(25) -Sensitivity:  Sensitivity of 92%(9) -In a 2011 study conducted in South Korea, researchers evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of the TIMP as an assessment tool for infant development -Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curve analysis was performed to evaluate the TIMP for screening infant motor development. ROC analysis showed areas under the curve of 0.825 in the physical index and 0.992 in the mental index on the Bayley III, indicating that the TIMP is an excellent tool for screening infant motor development -Seventy-six  preterm and term infants were recruited from a NICU and tested with the TIMPat their initial visit and at 6 months after the original test date -Researchers recommended that the TIMP be used as a reliable screening tool for neonates and infants < 4 months of age in South Korea instead of the more commonly used tools, the Denver Developmental Screening Test and Bayley III -Internal consistency:  Internal consistency coefficient of 0.98(1) -Authors of a study (N = 655 infants from Brazil) investigated psychometric properties ofthePortuguese version of the TIMP for use on infants in Brazil. They found the TIMP had high internal consistency(23) -Ceiling/floor Effects: -Authors of a study (N = 655 infants from Brazil) investigated psychometric properties of the Portuguese version of the TIMP for use on infants in Brazil. They found the TIMP had no ceiling or floor effects (23) \u2013Time to complete test:  The TIMP takes 25\u201340 minutes to administer depending on the child\u2019s abilities, behavioral state, physiological stability, and level of cooperation;(19) average time to complete is 33 minutes(1) -The TIMPSI was developed as a screening tool to determine which infants should take the TIMP, as the TIMP can be demanding on the youngest and most fragile infants(21)  \u2013Potential complications/side effects:  Researchers of one research study conducted in the United States found that some test items can cause infant irritability due to overall muscle weakness in infants with SMA type 1(7) \u2013Test preparation/materials required -Test authors recommend that PTs and OTs receive specific training in administration of the TIMP prior to administering it(2) -Infant Motor Performance Scales, LLC offers an online learning program for the TIMP.

Cinahl Information Systems, 1509 Wilson Terrace, Glendale, CA 91206Test of Infant Motor Performance (TIMP) Indexing Metadata/Description -Test authors recommend that PTs and OTs receive specific training in administration of the TIMP prior to administering it(2) -Infant Motor Performance Scales, LLC offers an online learning program for the TIMP. The program has 9 learning modules featuring lectures by the designers of the TIMP and other workshop instructors, videos of the TIMP in action, and opportunities for the learner to assess their comprehension of the material and score test-item video clips(13) -Infant Motor Performance Scales, LLC offers TIMP approved in-person  workshops in the United States and China. The 2-day  workshops are taught by certified instructors(13) -Examiners administering the TIMP should be fully trained and qualified to handle, examine, and care for infants(2) -Materials required to complete the TIMP -A rattle with a soft (not sharp or harsh) sound (e.g., maraca toys, plastic eggs or boxes filled with popcorn or rice)(2) -Any item used during the TIMP should not be used as a toy for the infant; these items should only be used for testing purposes(2) -A squeaky object with a soft (but not whispery or harsh) sound (many 4\u20135\u201d  dog toys can be used; however, latex toys should be avoided due to potential allergies)(2) -A shiny red ball approximately 55 mm, or 2 inches, in diameter(2) -An age calculation wheel that allows for automatic calculation of CA or chronologic age up to 18 weeks post-term  to accurately compare performance against age expectations from the TIMP and TIMPSI normative studies(2) \u2013Test procedure -Instructions for administration are included with the TIMP test kit(1) -The clinician administering the TIMP first observes the infant\u2019s behaviors, then elicits specific behaviors according to standardized procedures outlined by the test administration manual(3) -Items on the test include postural change, antigravity movement, adaptation to handling, visual reaction, auditory reaction, interaction with caregiver, and head and body control(15) \u2013Test scoring/interpretation -The 13 observed items are scored \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d(1) -A yes answer is equal to 1 point; a no answer is worth 0 points(1) -The 29 elicited items involve having the administering clinician handle the infant, place the infant in various positions, and document the infant\u2019s response to visual or auditory stimuli(1) -The instructions for the elicited items have pictures with a text description of the infant position, test procedure, and scoring criteria(1) -The elicited items have scoring options from 0 to 3, 0 to 4, 0 to 5, or 0 to 6; certain items are scored for both the left and right(1) -A total raw score ranges from 0 to 142.(19) The total raw score is calculated from the subtotal for the observed items and a subtotal for the elicited items; the clinician can use the chart in the manual to convert the raw score to the final TIMP score for the corresponding age group(1) -Score sheets allow for plotting the infant\u2019s scores against percentile ranks, which provide an age-equivalent  score(19) -Higher total score indicates better motor development and can be an early indication of motor developmental delay or atypical motor function in infants -The authors of the TIMP suggest a \u20130.5 standard deviation below the mean for identifying infants who may require close monitoring and/or referral for early intervention services(19) \u2013Test follow-up:  Developmental assessments such as the TIMP should be repeated frequently to document both age-related  and intervention-related  changes, document progression toward goals, and assist with more accurately predicting future motor skills/need for continued intervention(9)  References 1.Campbell SK.
