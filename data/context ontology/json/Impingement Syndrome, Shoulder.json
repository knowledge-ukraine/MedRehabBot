            "Subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS) is the most common painful disorder of the shoulder, accounting for 44% to 65% of all cases of shoulder pain in primary care. It is characterized by altered glenohumeral kinematics on elevation of the involved arm, especially in overhead activities such as reaching, lifting, and throwing that require abduction and internal rotation(1)",
            "SIS is associated with a musculoskeletal shoulder condition, such as subacromial bursitis, rotator cuff tendinosis, and calcific tendinitis of the biceps long head tendon. Some patients may have partial tears of rotator cuff tendons. SIS can, therefore, involve a spectrum of etiological factors(1,2)",
            "Rehabilitation, corticosteroid injection, and surgery are effective treatment approaches for reducing pain and disability in patients with SIS. Which of these approaches is best for pain management and improving shoulder function in the progressive stages of SIS remains unclear(1,2,45)"

            "The etiology of SIS remains debated, but it is probably multifactorial(1)",

            "Primary impingement: increased subacromial loading due to compression between the greater tuberosity of the humerusand the acromial arch is associated with variant anatomy of the scapula such as a curved or hooked acromion(1)",
