            "Definitions of pediatric urinary incontinence vary in the literature. In an effort to standardize terminology, in 2006 the International Children\u2019s Continence Society (ICCS) defined urinary incontinence as uncontrollable leakage of urine.(11)The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition( DSM-5 ), defines urinary incontinence as involuntary voiding of urine during the day, with a severity of at least twice a week, in children > 5 years of age in the absence of congenital or acquired defects of the CNS(15)",
            "Urinary incontinence can be further classified as intermittent or continuous. Despite efforts to standardize terminology, intermittent incontinence is also referred to as functional incontinence and continuous incontinence is also referred to as organic incontinence(11)",
            "In 2014, the ICCS updated its terminology to reflect the DSM-5  diagnostic criteria and ICD-10 classification(11)",
            "Functional urinary incontinence (where no anatomic or neurologic abnormality can be found) can be caused by an array of bladder storage and voiding disorders(1)",
            "If a child has been continent for at least 6 months before the development of incontinence, the continence is considered \u201csecondary.\u201d \u201cPrimary\u201d incontinence refers to continued leakage since infancy(11)",
            "Infants and children are considered untrained, not incontinent, up to the time of toilet training. Control of daytime bladder function matures between 2 and 3 years of age, whereas nighttime control is normally achieved between 3 and 7 years of age(15)",
            "Occasional accidents are not unusual in children up to 6 years of age",
            "Nocturnal enuresis (i.e., involuntary urinary incontinence at night after age of expected bladder control reserved for children > 5 years of age; or \u201cbedwetting\u201d) is classified as either monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (MNE) or nonmonosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (NMNE), the latter if there is evidence of lower urinary tract malfunction(17) \u2013Incontinence is used to describe loss of bowel or bladder function at any time, whereas enuresis is used primarily to describe urinary incontinence at night",
            "Approximately 3.1% of girls and 2.1% of boys 6\u20137 years old have an episode of wetting at least once per week(17) \u2013Of all children who wet, 10% have daytime wetting, 75% wet only at night, and 15% wet during the day and at night",
            "This paper focuses primarily on functional urinary incontinence in children (both daytime and enuresis) through age 17. This is also sometimes referred to as overactive  bladder or urge incontinence within the paper. Many of the causes of organic urinary incontinence are not indicators for physical therapy"

Treatment duration is typically 3 to 6 months, with 1month  breaks to determine if enuresis has stopped(16) Alpha blockers are sometimes used for treatment of children with symptoms of primary bladder neck dysfunction Intravesical botulinum toxin type A injections are used experimentally in refractory pediatric voiding dysfunction for children with idiopathic detrusor overactivity. It is considered a thirdline  option. The positive effects typically last 6 to 9 months and repeated injections are necessary.

A child must be evaluated within the context of his or her developmental age, which may be influenced by social, cultural, and environmental factors. The time course for attaining urinary continence shows individual variability. Most children (> 90%) achieve this developmental milestone prior to starting school (around 5 years of age). Beyond this age, incontinence becomes an increasing social concern. The need for treatment is determined by many factors, including the need to minimize the loss of self-esteem  and effects on interpersonal relationships, quality of life, and school performance European clinical practice evidence-based  guidelines on functional urinary incontinence were updated and published in 2013; however, these guidelines primarily focus on adults with urinary incontinence(10) treatment .",

The sensor can be placed in the child\u2019s underwear or pad near the perineum (personal alarm) or in a mat on which the child lies (a pad and bell alarm). Alarms can be audible or vibrate with light effects(16) -The use of alarms at night that detect moisture may eliminate nocturnal enuresis in children(7) -Based on a 2005 Cochrane systematic review, which included 55 trials, researchers concluded that alarm interventions are an effective treatment for nocturnal enuresis. Alarms are more effective than desmopressin or tricyclics. There is insufficient evidence to determine the efficacy of different types of alarm, or how alarms compare to behavioral interventions. Relapse rates were reduced when overlearning (giving children extra fluids at bedtime) was added to alarm treatment -Alarm therapy is curative in 60% of children -Minimal duration is 3 months and can be terminated after a child has achieved at least 14 consecutive dry nights(16) \u2013Lower urinary tract rehabilitation -Also referred to in the literature as pelvic floor rehabilitation and urotherapy -Typically includes behavioral modification, pelvic floor training, and biofeedback(4,25) -Behavioral modification techniques include timed voiding,(1,2) positive reinforcement for regular voiding,(1) avoiding acidic/diuretic beverages (caffeine, carbonated, citrus, chocolate),(1) adequate hydration,(1) and use of voiding diary(1,11,22) -An escalating treatment protocol starts with conservative techniques and progresses to more invasive techniques only after conservative methods have failed (22) -Pelvic floor training with biofeedback -In children with urge syndrome, the goal is to learn to suppress the sensation of need to void by normal central inhibition rather than by urethral compression (e.g., squatting)(2) -With dysfunctional voiding, the goal is to have children learn to relax the pelvic floor muscles to void without having to use abdominal pressure(2) \u2013Electrical stimulation/neuromodulation -Considered a second-level  intervention for children in whom efficacy of urotherapy has been poor -Different methods have been reported to be effective for improving lower urinary tract function, including transcutaneous stimulation over sacral nerve roots(8) -Anogenital electrical stimulation -For severe involuntary detrusor contractions -TENS -Used to suppress detrusor overactivity by modulating S3 reflex pathways -Interferential therapy is safe and well tolerated and may be an effective therapy in the treatment of children with nocturnal enuresis(21) -Based on an RCT conducted in Iran of 54 children, aged 6\u201314  years, with primary nocturnal enuresis -Children in the control group received standard urotherapy (hydration, scheduled voiding, toilet training, diet) whereas intervention group received standard urotherapy plus 15 sessions of interferential (IF) electrical stimulation for 20 minutes, twice per week -The IF stimulation was delivered at a carrier frequency of 4 kHz, a beat frequency sweep covering of 5-25 Hz, a duration of 250 \u03bcs and a repeated time of 6 s with adjustable amplitude (0-50  mA). Two rectangular self-adhesive  (2.5\u00d73.5 cm) electrodes were bilaterally placed on the skin of the symphysis pubic, and two other electrodes from each channel were crossly placed on the skin under the ischial tuberosity -The mean number of wet nights per week decreased from 5.7 to 1.1 after the 15 interferential sessions (5.4 to 3.3 days in control) and 78% were improved 1 year later, compared to 46% of the control group -.
