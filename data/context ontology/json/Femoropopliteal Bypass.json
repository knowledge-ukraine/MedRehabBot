            "Femoral popliteal bypass is a surgical procedure used to treat peripheral artery disease (PAD) of the femoral and/or popliteal arteries. Blood is redirected through either a healthy blood vessel that has been transplanted or a man-made  graft material sewn above and below the narrowed or blocked artery. Typically, the grafts originate from the femoral artery in the groin and go to the popliteal artery either just above or below the knee. The procedure may be performed under epidural or general anesthesia.(3) It is the most commonly performed bypass surgery in the body and may be the procedure of choice in situations of severe ischemic disease and limb salvage(17)"

Incisions are made over femoral and popliteal artery and the area explored before bypass conducted. Options for bypass include autogenous in situ saphenous vein graft (described below), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts or noncrimped velour graft, or composite graft(17) \u2013The vessel used for the graft is normally the long saphenous vein. This vein runs up the medial side of the leg from the ankle to the groin in line with the incisions used to expose the artery. Sometimes the vein is removed through a small third incision at mid-thigh  level and sometimes the two main incisions are joined to make one long incision -In some cases, rather than being removed, the saphenous vein is left in place (in situ graft). In this procedure, the valves that prevent back flow of blood are removed  from inside the vein using a small scope. The vein is then attached to the femoral and popliteal arteries(3) -If the long saphenous vein is unusable, a vein from the other leg or from the arm may be used. If no vein is suitable, an artificial graft is used",
