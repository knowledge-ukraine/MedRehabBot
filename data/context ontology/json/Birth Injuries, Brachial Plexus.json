In some cases, there are additional nerve root contributions from C4, referred to as a \u201cprefixed cord\u201d (22%), or from T2, referred to as \u201cpostfixed cord\u201d (1%)(5)",

Intervention usually begins within days of the child\u2019s birth (~ 7 to 10 days) to maintain ROM, prevent contracture development, and provide tactile stimulation (sensory re-education).(5) Physical/occupational therapy treatment sessions are needed for periodic reassessment of functional mobility and developmental milestone progression in order to update the therapeutic home exercise program and educate the parents on the child\u2019s progress. A child might need physical or occupational therapy during the growth course into adulthood when new limitations arise or loss of function/mobility occurs",

            "Prognosis varies depending on the degree of nerve injury to the brachial plexus. Patients with neuropraxic injuries have an excellent prognosis for full and rapid recovery. The prognosis for patients with axonotmesis injuries varies. Neurotmesis injuries require microsurgical procedures for recovery, with fair to poor outcomes. Avulsion injuries require microsurgical procedures and outcomes are very poor(5)",

            "Glenohumeral dysplasia with glenoid retroversion and posterior humeral head subluxation is present in 60% to 80% of children who do not recover full ROM. This might develop after shoulder internal rotation contracture due to muscle imbalance between internal and external rotators. The deformity increases with age and might be prevented if the child undergoes tendon transfer surgery(5)",
            "Authors of a Norwegian study that reexamined 69 persons with a BPBI at 10\u201320  years after birth found that 17 had a permanent lesion with decreased shoulder function, elbow extension, and UE weakness, but despite these deficits 16/17 were independent in ADLs and 15 reported having only minor functional difficulties(11)"

Parents need to be properly instructed and a written home program should be provided to them in order to facilitate compliance with the program. If a fracture is present, shoulder exercises should begin once the fracture has healed (3\u20134 weeks post-injury)(5)",
            "Tactile stimulation with various textures and bilateral upper extremity activities, such as grabbing feet with both hands, should also be included in the child\u2019s home program in order to facilitate cortical reorganization and the integration of the affected upper extremity(5)",
