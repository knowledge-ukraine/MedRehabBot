Treatment interventions in addition to physical therapy are CBT, psychotherapy, spinal cord stimulation, sympathetic nerve block, and sympathectomy (generally not recommended due to high rate of pain and symptom recurrence after 6\u201312  months). Referral to a mental health professional is of particular importance for the patient and caregiver(16,27,39) There is a greater risk for recurrence of CRPS without psychological intervention(25) \u2013It is well documented that there is a large psychosocial component in pediatric patients with chronic pain. In some children who develop chronic pain syndromes there is likely an interplay between genetic predisposition andpsychosocial factors(18) \u2013Patients need to learn positive coping strategies and avoid negative behaviors(27) \u2013Discussing psychological stress as a potential cause is vital because this allows parents to express their concern about the role stress plays in their child\u2019s pain(24) \u2013Common psychosocial factors that affect a child\u2019s ability to deal with chronic pain include real and imagined losses and fears, pain threshold, preferred coping strategy, and dependency level within their family(27) \u2013Common psychological treatment interventions that have found to be beneficial are biofeedback, relaxation methods, self-hypnosis,  and distraction techniques(27) \u2013Recurring psychological themes observed in a prospective study of patients with CRPS I who participated in an intense exercise therapy program were lack of verbalization or recognition of feelings, parental enmeshment with child, difficulty individuating from extremely close families, and the presence of unsupportive, noncohesive families(24) Several studies indicate that psychological symptoms related to CRPS are a result and not a cause of the disorder(4,27) \u2013Depression and anxiety are common results of chronic pain(27) \u2013Researchers in the Italy found that motor disorders seen in CRPS I are not associated with sensorimotor plasticity and are more closely aligned with psychogenic dystonia versus idiopathic dystonia(4) CRPS in the pediatric population impacts the patient as well as parents and family, resulting in high-stress  relationships and often decreased parental coping(1) \u2013Online forums may provide parents with support, information, and advice  \u2013Researchers found that there may be opportunity for healthcare providers to provide caregiver support that addresses emotional, physical, and information needs of caregivers \u2013Overall family life and everyday activities can be significantly impacted.

            "In addition to building trust with the patient, physical therapists need to learn how to distract the patient while he/she is participating in therapy sessions in order to maximize tolerance to treatment sessions, deemphasize pain, and emphasize function (i.e., Ask \u201chow much have you been able to do this week?\u201d vs. \u201cHow is your pain?\u201d). Physical therapists need to initiate desensitization treatments early so that the patient can understand that the treatment is not going to permanently hurt him/her.

Evidence-based  literature regarding treatment interventions to manage CRPS for both adults and children is limited and larger clinical trials need to be conducted(20)",
