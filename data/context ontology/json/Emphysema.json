There are organizations that include several other diseases under this term as well. COPD refers to a disease process that blocks or obstructs the passage of air through the lungs over time",

The reduced space in the chest cavity may lead to a more physiologic reconfiguration of the chest wall and diaphragm, helping the remaining lung tissue and diaphragm work more efficiently(8,30) In a cohort of 1,078 patients from the National Emphysema Treatment Trial in the United States, patients with emphysema who received LVRS were compared to patients who received medical intervention only. At 24 months, PaO 2 was reported to be increased and oxygen requirements decreased in the group that received LVRS(9) Patients undergoing maximal medical therapy plus LVRS were found to have improved health-related  QOL and gained more qualityadjusted  life years compared with maximal medical therapy alone in a prospective randomized clinical trial in the United States that involved 1,218 patients with severe emphysema(32) The significant differences were maintained until the sixth year Bronchoscopic lung volume reduction is an alternative to LVSR that is in later-stage clinical trials(30) This involves placement of one-way  expiratory valves or occluders, intended to cause collapse of the target area Injection of sealants into the peripheral airways to seal subsegmental target regions and eventually lead to airway collapse and atelectasis can also be used to reduce lung volume in select patients and target sites(30) Bronchoscopic coil treatment is a treatment to achieve lung volume reduction by placement of coils(33) A meta-analysis  of four independent European clinical trials showed that coil treatment improves pulmonary function, 6MWT distance, and QOL in patients with severe emphysema up to 1 year after treatment, independent of the distribution of the disease Lung transplantation for severe cases(30)",
