            "Signs and symptoms of a language disorder will vary greatly depending upon the cause of the language disorder, the age of the child, the language demands placed up the child, the severity of the language disorder, and the child\u2019s environment. The symptoms of language disorders can be mild or severe and can vary between children as well as during a single child\u2019s lifetime. School-aged  children with language disorders might display poor narrative skills, impaired social language (pragmatic) skills, problems learning to read and write, delayed rate of learning verbal material, and/or delayed language processing time.(2,4)Bilingual school-aged children are likely to display the same symptoms of language disorder as monolingual speakers of the same language. For example, the same types of grammatical errors are likely to be seen in the English language of a monolingual English-speaking  child with a language disorder and a bilingual English-speaking  and Spanish-speaking  child with a language disorder.(4) Bilingual children with a speech sound disorder in the area of phonology (i.e., phonological disorder) might exhibit sound error patterns displayed by monolingual children with phonological disorder in addition to patterns not usually produced by monolingual children.(5,6) Phonological errors produced by bilingual children can be determined by the phonological system of each of the child\u2019s specific languages (e.g., word initial consonant clusters do not occur in Turkish; therefore, initial cluster reduction would not be seen in Turkish). Additionally, the phonological system of one language might influence the phonological system in the other language and lead to the production of phonological errors (\u201cinterference patterns\u201d).(5) For detailed information on phonological disorders, see Speech Sound Disorders: Phonological ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T708559 Causes, Pathogenesis, & Risk Factors"

            "Precautions regarding the assessment of bilingual children \u2013Prior to receiving a speech and language evaluation, bilingual children should receive testing from a specialist in the area of bilingual language assessment in order to determine which language the child is most proficient in. It is important that proficiency testing assess academic language (e.g., reading and writing) in addition to speaking and listening skills(8) \u2013SLPs who assess bilingual children should be knowledgeable of the stages involved in the normal acquisition of a second language, including ways in which learning a second language (L2) can affect the child\u2019s use of his or her first language (L1). SLPs must be aware that children who are learning a second language might display decreasing skills in L1 even in the absence of a language disorder. Diminishing fluency in L1 is more likely to occur in children who do not receive continued support in developing that language(2,8,9) \u2013While children are in the process of learning a second language, their language skills and classroom performance might be affected by numerous affective, sociocultural, and linguistic factors (e.g., Is the child motivated to learn the second language? How much exposure does the child have to native speakers of this language? Does the child\u2019s family value the use of the second language? What is the family\u2019s socioeconomic status and how might this affect the child\u2019s language skills?)(8) \u2013When a language disorder is suspected, the child should always be assessed in both (or all) languages he or she is regularly exposed to in the home as well as school environments.(46) Additionally, it is critical to assess the child\u2019s collective language system (i.e., combined skills of L1 and L2) rather than his or her skills in each language separately. This can be done through the use of appropriate tests (tests with culturally and linguistically appropriate content, tests normed on children with the same linguistic background), observation, and/or family interview.(2,10,46) Combination of direct language measures via formal testing with informal parental interviews has been found to be an effective and sensitive measure of language abilities in bilingual children(52) \u2013Distinguishing a language difference from a language disorder is complicated by the fact that there is very little information on typical development in languages other than English and that much variety exists among speakers of other languages (e.g., Spanish speakers from Mexico might use different vocabulary from Spanish speakers from Spain or Central America).(6,8) Additionally, it is important to determine whether errors in a child\u2019s speech are related to limited proficiency in a second language or an actual language disorder. Errors made by typically developing bilingual children differ from errors made by bilingual children with language impairment. For a typically developing bilingual child, vocabulary substitution errors are common and often are influenced by knowledge of the child\u2019s first language; however, errors that violate syntactic principles of the language (e.g., omission of morphemes) are characteristic of a language disorder(41) \u2013A school or clinic policy to delay assessment until a specific time (e.g., 2 years of English instruction has been completed) is inappropriate. The timing of a language assessment for a bilingual child should be considered on an individual basis(2) \u2013Typically developing children who are early English language learners (those with less than 2 years of English learning) often make grammatical (morphological) errors that are the same as the errors made by monolingual English speakers  with a language disorder. Due to this fact, SLPs should use caution when considering morphological errors as an indicator of a language disorder in bilingual children. Additionally, typically developing children learning English vary greatly in the time they require to master English morphology(10) \u2013When the SLP conducting a language assessment on a bilingual child does not share the same languages as the child, collaboration with trained support personnel is recommended. Professional interpreters or translators, bilingual diagnosticians, bilingual speech language pathology assistants, trained speakers from the child\u2019s L1 community, and/or family members can fill this role(5) -In a study conducted in the United States with 167 children whose first language was Spanish and who were learning English as a second language, researchers completed comprehensive language assessments in both English and Spanish during the children\u2019s first-grade  year with bilingual SLPs. Researchers performed logistic regression analyses on the assessment results, using sensitivity to determine diagnostic accuracy. Researchers found that the results of English standardized testing could be used to make a reasonably accurate diagnosis for bilingual children who have attended public school for at least 1 year and were using English at least 30% of the time(39) \u2013Published research indicates that: 1) two separate phonological systems develop in bilingual children and 2) the stages of phonological development in typically developing bilingual children are different from the stages of phonological development in typically developing monolingual children who speak one of the same languages.(6) For example, a typically developing bilingual, English-  and Urdu-speaking  child will display phonological development in English that differs from the phonological development of a typically developing monolingual, English-speaking  child. Therefore, developmental information normed on monolingual children cannot be used to identify a phonological disorder in bilingual children \u2013There is evidence to suggest that bilingualism does not exacerbate language disorders in children; however, it might lead to slower development of vocabulary (in children with and without language impairment). In a study conducted in Finland with 73 Swedish-Finnish  bilingual children and 43 Swedish-speaking  monolingual children, researchers found that the children in the study population who were identified as having SLI had lower scores than the control (typically developing) group on all language tests. The bilingual children (with and without language impairment) had lower scores than the monolingual group (with and without language impairment) only on a test of body-part naming. The interaction of group (control versus SLI) and bilingualism was not significant on any of the language scores (i.e., bilingualism did NOT exacerbate a language disorder)(40)",
            "Precautions regarding standardized testing of bilingual children \u2013For clinicians in the United States, the use of standardized assessment measures is not recommended when testing bilingual children because 1) normative information on language development in nonstandard English speakers is lacking, 2) very few tests exist that have been normed on nonstandard English speakers, 3) conventional, norm-referenced  tests are culturally inappropriate for use with children from non-mainstream  American culture, and 4) such tests do not adequately capture a young child\u2019s strengths and weaknesses in the area of communication.(8,11,12,13) When assessing culturally and linguistically diverse children with suspected language disorders, it is critical to use methods such as observation across multiple natural settings with multiple conversation partners and to consider input from parent/caregiver report of a child\u2019s abilities(2,13) \u2013Criterion or curriculum-referenced  assessments provide quantitative information (such as what knowledge a child does or does not possess) and specific test scores. These tests can be used to assess the child\u2019s knowledge of the curriculum; however, they may be culturally and linguistically inappropriate and fail to provide information on the child\u2019s thought processes and the strategies he or she used to answer test questions(14) \u2013Tests that have been translated into a child\u2019s L1 are unreliable for many reasons (e.g., the test may have been normed on monolingual children) and should not be used to diagnose language disorders(8)"

From this speech-sample analysis, information on the child\u2019s phonetic inventory and speech production patterns can be gleaned. When assessing -It is permissible to conduct testing only in L1 if the child\u2019s exposure to L2 is negligible(17) -When the child has had consistent exposure to two languages, articulation testing should occur in both languages.(17) Unfortunately, tests rarely are available in languages other than English, and little information exists on the typical development of phonological skills in children speaking various language combinations (e.g., English and Punjabi, English and Arabic). When possible, the SLP should attempt to gather normative data on typical phonological development of the language combination in question. Following the acquisition of normative data, the speech of a child suspected of having an articulation or phonological disorder can be compared to the speech production of typically developing children who speak the same language combination.(6) Parent interview can also provide important information on the child\u2019s speech development, especially if the child has siblings with same language background. In this case, parents can compare and contrast the speech development of the child being assessed with his or her siblings in order to determine whether the child\u2019s speech is developing atypically -The SLP must consider the ways each language might affect articulation/phonology in the other language(17,18) -If the child does not display an articulation impairment in L1, an articulation impairment should not be diagnosed, even if errors occur in L2(17,18)  -Dialectical variations of speech production should not be considered errors(17) -The whole word measures phonological mean length of utterance (pMLU) and proportion of whole word proximity (PWP) are reliable measures of speech production in both monolingual and bilingual children and can be used to assess a bilingual child for a speech sound disorder(19) -pMLU examines the child\u2019s ability to produce words that are complex in length; the child receives one point for each correctly produced segment of the word and an additional point for each consonant in the correct position(19)the word \u201cweek\u201d has a target pMLU of 5; when produced correctly, it is phonetically transcribed as /wik/; the child would receive 3 points for correctly pronouncing each phonetic segment (i.e., /w/, /i/, and /k/) and then 2 points because /w/ and /k/ are each in the correct position(19) -PWP is calculated by dividing the child\u2019s pMLU by the target pMLU(19)using the word \u201cweek,\u201d if the child\u2019s production is transcribed as /wi/, his pMLU is 3 (a point each for /w/ and /i/ and another point for /w/ in the correct position); the PWP is 3 (actual pMLU) divided by 5 (target pMLU), or 0.6(19) -There are 6 stages of pMLU development (Stage I\u2013Stage  V+) outlined by Ingram and Ingram; for details on the specific stages see reference 20 -Bilingual children with a speech sound disorder will demonstrate the same articulation errors across both languages(18) -In a study comparing /s/ cluster reduction in Spanish-English  bilingual children with phonological disorders to /s/ cluster reduction in monolingual children with phonological disorders, researchers found that -monolingual children reduced /sl-/ clusters by dropping the second consonant (i.e., retaining the /l/) and the bilingual children demonstrated the opposite pattern (i.e., dropping the /l/ and retaining the /s/)(20) -addition of a \u201cprothetic vowel\u201d prior to the target /s/ cluster occurred only in the bilingual population(20) -except for these differences noted above, the pattern of /s/ cluster reduction was similar in bilingual and monolingual children(20)Assess language comprehension and expression -Ideally, language assessments should be conducted in L1 and L2; however, in many situations this is not possible due to a variety of reasons (e.g., lack of trained professionals who speak child\u2019s home language, lack of developmental information on child\u2019s L1). Additionally, language assessments that consider L1 and L2 separately may underestimate the child\u2019s true language abilities(2,21) -Due to the caveats associated with using standardized tests with bilingual children, language assessment may rely primarily on informal procedures such as observations, interview, and language sampling(8) -Language assessments of bilingual children may focus on functional communication and the child\u2019s ability to effectively communicate his or her thoughts, wants, and needs in daily interactions(8) -An alternative way to test the language skills of bilingual children is through the use of process measures. In contrast to product measures, which assess a child\u2019s current store of knowledge and skills, process measures assess a child\u2019s language learning or language processing system. Process measures include language-learning  measures (such as dynamic assessment) and language-based  processing measures (wherein a child\u2019s ability to process language in various conditions, such as decreased response time, is assessed)(2) -In a study conducted with bilingual children (Dutch-Turkish)  in the Netherlands, researchers found that errors in verb inflection varied considerably and there was no specific error profile that could be used to distinguish typically developing children from those with SLI(37)Pragmatics includes the social use of language and the often implicit rules that dictate the ways language is used to communicate.(22) The three levels of pragmatics are intentions (why a child communicates), conversational discourse (turn-taking,  topic changing rules), and role taking (the ability to take the listener\u2019s perspective during conversation.(22) Strong pragmatic skills are essential for being able to engage socially and linguistically, while weak pragmatic skills may indicate the risk of or presence of a language disorder. What are considered appropriate pragmatic skills vary significantly across cultural groups,(15) and the SLP must be knowledgeable of typical pragmatics in aAre children expected to initiate conversation with adults? Are children \u201callowed\u201d to direct topics of conversation? Are young children\u2019s verbalizations and actions considered intentional?(15) Language inventories are used to gather information about a child\u2019s current use of language asWhat are the child\u2019s communication environments? Who are the child\u2019s language partners? What purposes will each language serve in the child\u2019s daily life?(1,22)Samples of the child\u2019s expressive language skills in L1 and L2 should be collected during conversations between the child and a peer, sibling, parent, or language-matched professional/paraprofessional. Language samples are an essential part of assessment for specific language impairment and complement information obtained in standardized testing.(54) Language samples of English provide information on the child\u2019s mean length of utterance (MLU), lexical diversity, and pragmatic functions. Although developmental norms exist for English-language skills, such norms may not exist for the child\u2019s L1. Additionally, for languages other than English and Spanish, no guidelines exist regarding the collection and analysis of language samples.(2) As a nonstandardized option, adult speakers of the child\u2019s L1 could listen to the language sample and make objective judgments on the appropriateness of the child\u2019s language(8)Wordless books can be used to assess a child\u2019s production of a narrative. Bilingual children with language impairments are likely to have problems with respect to producing the microstructure (details, complexity) and macrostructure (beginning, middle, end)elements of narratives(35)Observation can occur in structured and/or unstructured activities and should occur across multiple settings as the child interacts with a variety of conversation partners(14)There is conflicting evidence about whether it is appropriate to use nonword repetition tasks to assess for language impairment in bilingual children. At this time, the evidence does not universally support or refute the use of these tasks in a language evaluation for a bilingual child(23,24,48)Assess vocal function, including vocal quality, loudness, pitch, and endurance; if there are specific concerns regarding voice, refer to otolaryngologist for complete workup to rule out laryngeal pathologies prior to completing a full",

            "Supporting the development of both L1 and L2 \u2013Developing an effective plan of care for bilingual children must include making long-term  plans to support the development of both L1 and L2.(27) The acquisition of both the home language and the language of the majority culture or school will allow the child to participate in a full range of language activities with social, emotional, cultural, educational, and vocational value(2) \u2013Language intervention should first occur in the child\u2019s L1 in order to support his or her conceptual and linguistic development and to ensure continued development in L1.(8,21,27) Published research supports the use of L1 in the treatment of bilingual children and indicates that focusing on developing skills in the home language does not negatively impact their acquisition of L2.(21,27) When possible, bilingual children with language impairment should be treated in both languages(49,50) \u2013Although supporting the child\u2019s home language should be the first priority of early intervention services, bilingual children with language disorders are likely to need bilingual intervention in order to support the development of L2 as they reach school age.(27) Linguistic features of L2 that are not present in L1 may require more focused attention (e.g., verb endings that are used to indicate tense are present in English but not Mandarin Chinese)(21) \u2013SLPs should be aware that mixing languages (\u201ccode switching\u201d) is common in many families and has social, cultural, and linguistic value. Therefore, code switching should not be discouraged, nor should parents/family members be encouraged to keep languages separate during informal interactions.(21,27) Although code switching during conversation should not be discouraged, certain activities can be carried out at times to focus on each language individually (e.g., book reading, singing, rhyming)(2)",
            "Training parents, teachers, paraprofessionals, and peers to implement treatment \u2013Research supports the effectiveness of training parents and/or paraprofessionals who speak the child\u2019s L1 to provide intervention services;(27) however, when implementing parent training programs, the SLP must be aware of cultural differences in communication styles(15) \u2013Research demonstrates that using typically developing peer models can facilitate language development in children with language disorders or delay. Therefore, matching 2 children with the same L1 (one typically developing, one with a language disorder) might serve to improve the language skills of the child with a language disorder(27) ",
            "General language-learning  strategies:  These strategies may be implemented in either (or both) of the child\u2019s languages in order to increase his or her skills across languages \u2013Increase student\u2019s attention to subtle changes in the acoustic or visual signal that changes phrase or sentence meaning (e.g., \u201cThe dogs played ball\u201d vs. \u201cThe dog played ball\u201d). The goal is that increased awareness of subtle changes in one language will increase the child\u2019s awareness of subtle changes in all languages he or she encounters(2) \u2013School-aged  children who grow up speaking the language of their school system (typically English in the United States) rely upon their previous language experience coupled with information provided from the acoustic signal when decoding language in an educational setting. However, children with a limited English background rely much more heavily on the acoustic signal to decode linguistic information. Therefore, the unfavorable signal-to-noise  ratios that exist in many American classrooms are more detrimental to second-language learners than to monolingual students. The following strategies are recommended to improve the acoustic/listening conditions of classrooms containing English-language learners:(28) -Educational audiologist and/or SLP consult with classroom teachers to identify the ways in which student needs and classroom acoustics interact -Educational audiologist and/or SLP collaborate with classroom teachers to develop ways to reduce classroom noise during instructional activities -Educational audiologist and/or SLP collaborate with classroom teachers to improve the acoustic signal, especially during activities focusing on literacy",
            "Generalization/transfer of linguistic skills across languages:  Research has yielded conflicting results as to whether linguistic skills targeted and achieved in one language will transfer to another language in bilingual children with language disorders.(2) The degree of transfer may depend upon: 1) the area of language affected by the disorder (e.g., phonology, syntax, semantics), 2) how similar both languages are in the targeted aspect (e.g., do both languages use morphological endings to indicate verb past tense?), 3) the severity of language disorder, and 4) the type of intervention being provided.(2) Therefore, experts in the area of bilingual language disorders recommend that transfer of skills from one language to another be explicitly targeted. Recommended strategies include: \u2013Explicit instruction on the similarities in form and meaning between the two languages (e.g., addition of \u201cs\u201d to many nouns to signal plurality in both Spanish and English)(1) \u2013Forward and backward translation activities to highlight similarities and differences in language form while maintaining language meaning. For example, in an exercise targeting syntax, a Mandarin-speaking  child describes action photos in English at school; takes the pictures home, where he or she asks an adult to describe the actions in Mandarin into an audio recorder; and returns to school, where he or she translates the adult\u2019s descriptions into grammatically correct English (with assistance as necessary)(2) \u2013Back-and-forth  home school books to target vocabulary development: a notebook is created that contains pictures of items used at school or in language treatment sessions. The pictures are labeled with the appropriate English word and then sent home to be labeled in the child\u2019s home language. Family members can add pictures of items from home which can then be translated into English at school(2) \u2013In a randomized controlled trial conducted in Canada with 29 bilingual children who had primary language impairment (PLI), researchers found that both bilingual and monolingual treatment resulted in improvements in L2. For all of these children, L2 was French. The native/home languages were varied and included Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, and Spanish, among others. The children were randomized into monolingual (French/L2) treatment group (n = 11), bilingual treatment group (n = 9), and a control/delayed treatment group (n = 9). Sessions took place once weekly, for 50 minutes at a time, for 16 weeks. Language therapy targeted vocabulary and syntax goals that were appropriate for each given child. At the conclusion of the intervention, French vocabulary significantly improved in only the treated groups, but not the delayed treatment/control group. Syntax abilities improved for all children, regardless of whether they were receiving treatment or not. Researchers concluded that both monolingual and bilingual treatments appeared to result in gains in L2, but not L1. Researchers considered that the intensity of the treatment (1x/week) was not enough to produce significant differences between the monolingual and bilingual treatment groups(45) \u2013In a study conducted in the United States, 59 school-aged Spanish-English  bilingual children with SLI were randomly assigned to one of four groups (nonlinguistic cognitive processing, English-only,  bilingual, or control [deferred treatment]) in addition to their school-based speech-language  treatment services. All experimental treatment groups received 360 minutes of therapy per week for 6 weeks. In the nonlinguistic cognitive processing treatment group, therapy activities all involved nonlinguistic stimuli to target memory and attention skills. Treatment activities for the children in the English-only  or bilingual treatment groups were exactly the same except that treatment was provided  primarily in Spanish (80% of the time) for the bilingual group. Both the English and Spanish treatment activities were aligned with traditional, evidence-based  principles and incorporated a combination of computer-based  and interactive language activities. At the conclusion of therapy, all treatment groups made gains on multiple measures of English and outperformed the control group. Outcome measures indicated that changes in the targeted areas for each treatment group occurred: significant increases in processing speed occurred in the nonlinguistic treatment group; significant improvements on English-language  measures occurred in the English-only treatment group; improvements (although not statistically significant) were observed in both Spanish and English in the bilingual treatment group. Interestingly, more of the measures of English language reached statistical significance than did the Spanish-language  measures in the bilingual treatment group despite the fact that treatment was primarily conducted in Spanish(34) -These researchers also sought to assess long-term outcomes of the three different types of interventions. In a separately published study using the same children from the initial study, researchers examined treatment effects after a period of 3 months. In the data analysis, researchers examined generalization of skills learned in therapy rather than performance on specific trained items. Improvements were observed on all English-language  measures for both the English-only and bilingual treatment groups. Researchers also noted that the children in the study exhibited maintenance of Spanish-language abilities. Because Spanish is L1/home language, and not the dominant language in their school or community, there is a risk of losing ability in that language due to lack of practice opportunities(47) -Authors of the studies above completed a prior study with 2 Spanish-English  bilingual children with SLI in which they assessed the effect of nonlinguistic cognitive processing treatment on language skills. Outcome measures demonstrated that both participants made gains in the targeted nonlinguistic cognitive processing skills as well as on measures of Spanish and English language skills(38)",
            "Vocabulary instruction: A child\u2019s vocabulary level is an important predictor of reading comprehension (i.e., in order to be successful in English reading comprehension, a child must have a solid knowledge of English vocabulary). Therefore, programs with the goal of teaching bilingual children to read in L2 must contain components focusing on vocabulary development in L2.(29,30) V ocabulary instruction includes: \u2013Shared book reading: An instructional activity wherein one or more adults shares a book with a group of children. During the interaction, the adult provides scaffolding to target learning goals, such as vocabulary development, and collaborative learning between adult and child is encouraged. Adults engaging in shared book-reading activities should adjust their input according to the children\u2019s level of engagement, interest, and language comprehension(30,31) \u2013Previewing content-area  vocabulary that will be used in the child\u2019s classroom through the use of semantic webs, comparison chart, and Venn diagrams(2) \u2013Establishing the use of a back-and-forth  home school book as discussed above(2)",
            "Reading development:  Children with language disorders are at increased risk for reading and writing difficulties. Additionally, children who receive reading instruction in L2 may require more explicit instruction than monolingual children learning to read in L1.(29) Increasingly, SLPs, especially those working in the school setting, are becoming responsible for participating in programs aimed at preventing reading failure (such as Response to Intervention [RTI] and providing interventions that support reading skill development(32) \u2013RTI consists of the following components:(33) -Identify children who are at risk  for poor learning outcomes, such as those who are English-language  learners and/or those who have a language disorder (e.g., poor reading development) -Monitor students\u2019 progress over the course of instruction -Provide evidence-based  interventions to those children who do not progress -Adjust the intensity and nature of the intervention according to student progress and responsiveness -Identify students with learning disabilities \u2013RTI typically is delivered in three \u201ctiers\u201d of instruction(32) -First-tier  instruction is delivered in mainstream classrooms. Reading instruction is composed of evidence-based practices -Second-tier  instruction is provided to students whose reading skills fail to progress with first-tier instruction. Second-tier instruction may include small-group  work targeting specific reading skills -Third-tier  instruction is provided to students who have failed to meet criterion levels of reading development by 3rd grade or beyond. Before receiving third-tier  instruction, a student undergoes a complete educational assessment and may subsequently qualify for special education services (which are considered third-tier  levels of instruction)  \u2013For detailed information on RTI, see Clinical Review\u2026Response to Intervention (RTI) ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T709175",
            "Treating phonological disorders:  Experts on phonological disorders in bilingual children recommend the following treatment hierarchy: \u2013First, treat phonological patterns (errors) that occur with the same frequency in both L1 and L2 since these error patterns affect intelligibility in both languages. Treatment should occur in both of the child\u2019s languages. However, the syllable structure of the language must also be considered in deciding which goals to initially include and/or leave out. For example, if the child\u2019s L1 does not contain many multisyllabic words, targeting the production of two-syllable  words (syllabicity) would not be appropriate, although that is often an initial goal in the remediation of phonological disorders in English when syllable deletion is exhibited(5) \u2013Second, treat phonological patterns that occur with unequal frequency in L1 and L2. For example, final consonant deletion may occur in the Spanish and English of a bilingual child. However, since final consonants are less common in Spanish than English, the rate of final consonant deletion is likely to be lower and have less of an effect on Spanish intelligibility. Treatment should be conducted in both of the child\u2019s languages(5) \u2013Third, treat phonological processes that occur in only one of the child\u2019s languages. Treatment should occur in only the affected language(1) .
