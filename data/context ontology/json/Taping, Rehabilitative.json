            "Rehabilitative taping is the application of various types of rigid or elastic tape on a body part to achieve desired treatment outcomes. Controversy exists as to whether taping improves treatment outcomes for specific clinical conditions more than conventional therapeutic approaches without taping",
            "Kinesio taping (KT)(1) \u2013This tape is very elastic (can be stretched longitudinally up to 120\u2013180%  of its original size) and the thickness and elasticity are similar to that of human skin(1) \u2013Unlike non-elastic  tape, KT can provide support to injured soft tissue and joints while allowing safe and pain-free ROM, which in turn allows the recovering athlete to participate in activity while he or she recovers from minor to moderate sports-related injuries(1) \u2013KT has been shown to have positive physiological effects on the skin, lymphatic vessels and subsequent circulatory system, fascia, muscles, ligaments, tendons, and joints(1) \u2013KT has been clinically shown to help with inflammation and pain by encouraging the facilitation of lymphatic drainage and increasing interstitial space by lifting the skin, thus reducing tissue compression and the associated pain(1) \u2013Functions of KT(2) -Improvement of muscular function -Gathering fascia to align tissue in the desired position -Activation of blood and lymph circulation by lifting the skin over areas of inflammation, pain and edema -Deactivation of the pain system by stimulating cutaneous mechanoreceptors -Supporting the function of joints by stimulating proprioceptors, correcting the direction of movement, and increasing stability \u2013With KT, muscles can be both facilitated and inhibited(1) \u2013KT has shown promise in improving upper extremity control in pediatric patients with acquired neurological injury(7,8)",
            "Myofascial taping: Intended for the relief of acute and chronic myofascial pain syndromes; tapes used are flexotape(3) \u2013Tape used has a strong adhesive and a lower recoil effect than KT(3) \u2013Application is based on treatment of underlying myofascia(3) -The fascial network contains 10 times more sensory receptors than muscles and its mechanical receptors inform the body about position, motion, and pain  -Tightening or scarring of fascial tissue (e.g., in response to demands of everyday life, work habits, sports, or injuries) can alter posture and movement patterns secondary to reduced mobility and abnormal muscle tone -In theory, muscle tone normalizes with increased myofascial mobility, allowing for more healthy, efficient, and pain-free posture and movement \u2013Myofascial taping works to remove tension and restrictions in the fascia allowing for the above-mentioned  restoration of normal myofascial mobility(3) \u2013The physiological effects are achieved by intensive myofascial release and activation(3) \u2013Evidence is lacking to support the theory of myofascial taping(3)",
            "Mulligan fibular repositioning taping (FRT):(19) \u2013Mulligan FRT is most often used to improve postural control in persons with chronic ankle instability (CAI) \u2013Requires two 20-cm  pieces of rigid tape that can be worn for several days \u2013Utilized on patients with CAI to correct anterior positional fault of the distal fibula on the tibia or in patients with associated plantar fasciitis",
            "Other foot and ankle taping techniques(typically, rigid athletic tape is used for the foot):(6,28) \u2013Hallux spica: for turf toe or soccer toe \u2013Taping for ankle sprains \u2013Achilles tendon taping \u2013Sever\u2019s disease/heel taping \u2013Plantarfasciitis(41)",
            "McConnell taping (MT): Uses a rigid, highly adhesive tape that can be worn for up to 18 hours(4) \u2013Taping for the knee: MT may reduce pain and improve function in patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS)(4,5) \u2013MT may reduce anterior knee pain by regulating the mediolateral pulling force of the patella, improve joint alignment, and facilitate the vastus medialisobliquus (VMO)(4) \u2013The four main malalignments at the knee that MT may influence are excessive lateral glide, excessive lateral tilt, excessive posterior tilt of the inferior pole, and excessive rotation \u2013MTmay also improve proprioception(4)"

            "KT vs MT \u2013Authors of a 2015 systematic review and meta-analysis  (11 articles that looked at pain, muscle flexibility, patellar alignment, proprioception, motor function, muscle activity, and QOL) found these effects of KT versus MT in patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS)(15) -MT is used to correct patellofemoral alignment while being anchored lateral to the patella, then pulled over the patella toward medial knee -KT is applied to correct patellar position, improve proprioceptive stimulation for VMO weakness, and relieve tension from vastus lateralis, hamstrings, and IT band -There is a lack of evidence that KT affects patellar alignment -MT may correct patellar alignment but not proprioception or motor function in patients with PFS -Both KT and MT can improve muscle activity, motor function, and QOL related to pain relief \u2013Authors of a cohort study (n = 20 patients with anterior unilateral knee pain) in the United States found that KT and MT may both reduce anterior knee pain during stair-climbing activities(4) -All subjects performed a squat lift and negotiated stairs under 3 conditions: no tape, KT, and MT -Both taping techniques were more effective than no tape, and there was no statistically significant difference between the two taping conditions \u2013In a systematic review comparing elastic taping (kinesiology tape) to non-elastic  taping (Leukotape sports tape) for the management of knee osteoarthritis (OA), researchers found that non-elastic  taping, not elastic taping,reduced patient-reported  pain and improved functional performance(29)",
            "MT \u2013Authors of a cohort study (n = 87 patients with OA, including 16 with anterior unilateral knee pain) in Korea found improved vastus medialis activity and improved ratio of muscle activity between the vastus medialis and vastus lateralis with MT over no taping and placebo taping(5) -Muscle activity was recorded with EMG during a squat -Subjects were assigned to groups that received no tape, control taping,or therapeutic taping and reported the average severity of knee pain over a week during movement and a selected aggravating activity -Tape was applied to provide medial glide, medial tilt, and anteroposterior tilt to the patella -Improvements in pain and disability were statistically significant over no tape and control tape \u2013Authors of a 2015 systematic review found insufficient evidence to support the use of MT for treating anterior knee pain(20)",
            "Preventive taping -Three case-control  studies assessed alterations in gait mechanics with taping and bracing for patients with CAI-related impairments(30) -Kinesiotape decreased excessive inversion in early stance -Athletic taping decreased excessive inversion and plantar flexion in swing phase; tibial external rotation was limited at terminal stance -The flexible and semi-rigid  brace increased dorsiflexion ROM; the semi-rigid  brace also limited plantarflexion ROM at toe off -Authors concluded there was limited-quality evidence for taping and bracing to alter gait in patients with CAI \u2013Prophylactic taping may be used for patients with a UCL sprain transitioning back to sport-specific activity(12)",
            "KTfor knee osteoarthritis \u2013Authors of an RCT (94 subjects in the early rehabilitation period after TKR randomized to a regular rehabilitation program or a regular program with the addition of KT) in Lithuania found that KT reduced postoperative pain and edema and improved knee extension but not knee flexion(9) \u2013Authors of an RCT (n = 60 adults with knee OA randomized to a KT group or a sham-taping control  group) in Brazil found that after 4 days of continuous taping, there were no significant differences or changes between groups instrength in knee extension or flexion, pressure pain threshold, swelling, Lysholm score, or WOMAC score(26) \u2013Authors of an RCT (n = 42 adults with knee OA randomized to a KT group or a placebo-taping control  group) in Turkey found at 1-month  follow-up  that compared to baseline:(27) -ROM and muscle strength were not significantly different between the 2 groups  -Pain during activity and walking performance both improved more in the KT group \u2013Pain at night and knee flexion ROM also improved more in the KT group. Authors of a 2020 systematic review assessed the comparative effects of physical therapy alone vs physical therapy combined with kinesiology taping in patients with knee OA. The review included 15 studies and 546 patients, with outcomes assessed 1 and 6 weeks after initial treatments(31) -Significant pain reduction and functional improvement were reported 6 weeks after initial treatment -Functional improvement was determined using the WOMAC \u2013Authors of a 2020 systematic review sought to determine the effectiveness of elastic taping (kinesiology tape and others) in patients with knee OA. Eleven RCTs were included, with 490 patients(32) -Elastic taping had significant effects on pain, ROM, physical function, and quadriceps muscle strength, but the authors concluded that there was insufficient evidence to draw conclusions on elastic taping combined with other physical therapy interventions \u2013Authors of a 2019 systematic review assessed the effectiveness of kinesiology tape (alone) versus sham taping. The study included 6 RCTs looking at low back pain and knee OA(33) -All findings were of low quality and evidence was inconclusive, but a superior effect on pain with kinesiology tape vs sham taping was shown -Follow-up  to determine intervention outcomes took place 1 week after the intervention",
            "KT for neurological conditions \u2013Authors of an RCT (n = 20 patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease showing abnormalities in trunk posture)in Italy found that the addition of KT did not improve results compared to standard postural rehabilitation(10) \u2013Authors of an RCT (30 hemiparetic stroke patients) in Korea found that application of KT to major paralyzed parts was associated with improved walking speed and a more symmetrical gait(11) -KT was applied to facilitate the quadriceps femoris, tibialis anterior, biceps brachii, and upward rotators of the scapula \u2013Authors of a 2019 systematic review who investigated the effects of KT on balance impairments in stroke found that KT was more effective than conventional rehabilitation methods post stroke for balance function, lower limb function, and walking function(34) -Measures of improvement included the Berg Balance Scale, TUG, functional ambulation scale, Fugl-Meyer assessment, and Modified Ashworth Scale -There was no significant difference with a \u22644-week treatment duration, but there was with > 4-week duration \u2013Authors of 2019 systematic review assessed the effects of KT on post-stroke  rehabilitation and found that patients were significantly improved in lower extremity spasticity, motor function, balance, ambulation, gait parameters, and daily activities(35) -Results were compiled from 14 RCTs (783 patients total) with low- to moderate-quality  evidence",
            "KT in pediatrics \u2013Authors of a quasi-RCT  (n = 30 babies, 1 to 4 months of age, with unilateral obstetric Erb\u2019s palsy) in Egypt found that KT applied over the deltoid and forearm in addition to a physical therapy program enhanced recovery over the physical therapy program alone(7) \u2013Authors in 2018 performed a systematic review of the available researchon the effects of taping on motor function in children with motor impairments. The study found that elastic taping improved upper limb function, gross motor skills, postural control, muscular balance, and performance of functional and daily activities(36) -The review included 12 studies, 5 of which were RCTs. Cerebral palsy was the most common disorder, followed by congenitalmuscular torticollis and brachial plexus palsy \u2013Authors of a 2020 systematic review who assessed the efficacy of KT for children with a brachial plexus injury found that there was improvement in scapulothoracic internal rotation(37) -Overall, the authors concluded that the effects attributed to KT were questionableand these effects were influenced depending on the technique or mode of application -Five studies met inclusion criteria,two of which were included in the meta-analysis",
            "KT for low back pain (LBP) \u2013Authors of an observational study(n = 21 adults with chronic LBP) in Korea found that applying KT provided no immediate improvements in core muscle activation during TRX suspension band training(14)  \u2013Researchers of an RCT (n = 40 adults with nonspecific LBP) in Saudi Arabia found no difference in outcomes between traditional physical therapy (stretching and abdominal strengthening exercises) and traditional physical therapy with the addition of KT for treatment of nonspecific LBP(2) \u2013Authors of a 2019 systematic review that included 10 RCTs found that kinesiology tape was effective in improving disability when compared to placebo tape. Both the KT and placebo tape reduced pain(38) \u2013Authors of a 2019 systematic review assessed KT as a treatment method for nonspecific chronic LBP. They found that pain and function (measured with V AS and the Oswestry Disability Index, respectively) were improved in the KT group relative to the control group(16)",
            "KT for pain \u2013Authors of a 2019 systematic review found that KT applied for myofascial pain syndrome was effective for decreasing pain intensity and improving ROM; pain intensity remained improved at follow-up(39) -The study found no effect on disability or function -The study included 20 RCTs with 959 patients \u2013Authors of a 2018 systematic review assessed the use of KT for treatment of kinesiophobia and found that there is a lack of high quality evidence to support the use of KT for kinesiophobia(40) -Two studies met inclusion criteria.In a study of patellofemoral pain syndrome, a reduction in kinesiophobia was found in long-term  follow-ups.In  a study of LBP, no significant difference in pain reduction was found compared with placebo taping",
            "KT and other taping for the ankle \u2013Authors of a 2015 systematic review found that in the short term, taping for plantar fasciitis may provide pain relief. The most common techniques used were low Dye taping and calcaneal taping(17) -Low Dye taping: lifts navicular bone to decrease medial pressure on the heel -Calcaneal taping: alters foot biomechanics by repositioning the calcaneus to neutral alignment, increasing the height of the medial longitudinal arch \u2013Authors of a 2020 systematic review found that mechanical treatment can be effective for treatment of plantar fasciitis. Taping was one proven method, but for short-term treatment only(41) -Other findings in this review included that insoles are more effective than heel cups and that combining night splints or rocker shoes with insoles is more effective than use of night splints, rocker shoes, or insoles singly \u2013Authors of a 2018 systematic review found that low Dye taping (athletic tape) was effective in reducing plantar fasciitis pain(42) -The low Dye taping technique was found to be most effective when used for an initial 3-6 week range, and was recommended as a viable alternative to insoles/medial arch supports -Authors of a 2018 systematic review assessed the effectiveness of KT vs other forms of taping for ankle functional performance measures and found KT to be superior in terms of performance on the Star Excursion Balance Test and vertical jump height(43) Use of athletic tape reduced performance on the vertical jump test, while KT did not -There was no difference between common athletic taping and KT for ankle ROM \u2013Authors of an observational study (n = 16 professional athletes with CAI) in Iran found that Mulligan ankle taping improved performance on functional tests(19) -Participants were assessed on single-leg  hopping, figure-of-8  hop, and side hop tests -20cm of non-stretch  tape was applied with the ankle in neutral with a posterolateral superior glide of the fibula. A second piece of tape provided a posterior glide of the distal fibula -The subjects reported improved perceptions of stability and decreased feelings of instability \u2013Authors of a randomized crossover study (convenience sample of 20 healthy professional soccer players)in the United Kingdom found that fine movement and balance scores on a Kin-Com  125AP isokinetic dynamometer were not different in the ankle KT trial group versus no-taping  group. This finding suggests that KT did not affect lower-limb proprioception(21)Authors of a 2019 systematic review determined that there was moderate evidenceto refute the use of fibular reposition taping to improve postural control in patients with CAI(44)",
            "Athletic performance \u2013Authors of a 2012 meta-analysis  found insufficient evidence to support the use of KT over other types of tape in the management or prevention of sports injuries(13)  \u2013The analysis found that KT may have a small beneficial role in improving strength, ROM, and force sense error (a means of measuring proprioception)Authors of an observational study (n = 18 elite female track and field athletes) in Germany found KT had no influence on jumping performance(18) -Double one-legged  jump test was performed before and after application of blue K-Active  tape(without traction) to the gastrocnemius, hamstrings, rectus femoris, and iliopsoas muscles of the right lower extremity -No significant difference in performance with and without the KT was measured \u2013Authors of a 2020 systematic review assessed the effect of KT on neuromuscular control of the lower extremity in athletic and general populations(45) -Their results showed grade-B  evidence that KT in athletic populations does not improve biomechanical ankle stability -Grade-B  evidence was inconclusive regarding the efficacy of KT for patients with knee pain symptoms \u2013Authors of a 2017 systematic review found an overall lack of evidence to support using KT in athletic populations to enhance performance(44) -Sports performance abilities in the study included ball skills, power squats, cycling, dynamic balance, vertical and horizontal jumping, agility, sprint speed, and distance running -There were 193 total comparisons between KT and other tape or no tape at various reference times after application -11 studies demonstrated a significant effect: 2 in favor of KT tape, 8 in favor of Mulligan tape, 1 in favor of no tape at all",
            "Rehabilitative taping versus control \u2013Authors of an RCT (n = 45 adults with cervical spondylosis randomized to a conventional rehabilitation [CR] control group, Mulligan mobilization and CR group, or KT and CR group)in Turkey made the following findings at 1-month follow-up  after 3 weeks of treatment(22) -Neck pain and Neck Disability Index scores decreased and cervical ROM and muscle strength increased with time in all 3 groups -Cervical extension and left and right rotation improved more in the Mulligan and KT groups compared to the control group -Right lateral flexion ROM improved more in the Mulligan group versus controls -Deep cervical flexor muscle strength increased more in the KT group versus the Mulligan group and the controls \u2013Authors of a systematic review assessed the effect on periscapular muscle activity of scapular taping,a common treatment for scapular dysfunction(47) -Eight of the studiesfound that upward rotation of the scapula was improved with scapular taping. The effects of scapular taping on scapular external rotation and posterior tilt were conflicted",
            "KT for the shoulder \u2013Authors of an observational study in the United States found that KT did not improve shoulder strength or proprioception, or scapular kinematics, in patients with shoulder impingement pain or in healthy subjects(23) -20 patients with shoulder pain received either KT (n = 10) or placebo taping (n = 10) on the involved shoulder -10 healthy subjects with no previous history of shoulder pathology received KT on the dominant shoulder \u2013Authors of an RCT (n = 140 patients,18 and 65 years of age, with subacromial pain syndrome randomized to a rigid shoulder taping plus physiotherapy group or a physiotherapy-only control  group) in the Netherlands tested shoulder pain intensity and functioning at baseline and at 6-months  follow-up(24) -Pain intensity, but not functioning, improved significantly more in the control group -Patient-specific  complaints were not significantly different between groups \u2013Authors of a systematic review found that research evidence for KT as an adjunct to physical therapy treatment for subacromial impingement syndrome was weak and conflicting(45) -The authors discuss KT as a possible treatment modality in conjunction with exercise, electrotherapy, and manual therapy, but further research is necessary \u2013A systematic review from 2020 concluded that there is limited and weak evidence to support KT as an effective treatment for shoulder pain. There was weak evidence to suggest combinations of KT with other treatments like exercise would be effective to treat shoulder pain(46) \u203a. Authors of an RCT (60 adults with forward head posture randomly assigned to an exercise group, KT group, or control group for a 5-week  intervention)in Taiwan found that both KT and exercise improved head posture at 2-weeks follow-up. Exercise increased lower cervical angle more than KT(25) ",
            "KT related to cancer treatment \u2013Authors of a case series review in 2020 concluded that the use of KT for pain management in patients with cancer was effective(48) -Patients reported increased ability to perform ADLs, reduction in psychological stress, and reduced fatigue -The primary goal in these cases was palliative care using KTto improve quality of life \u2013Authors of a systematic review in 2018 found that KT was effective in treating symptoms related to lymphedema post-mastectomy(49) -The study advocated for KT to be used in patients having compliance issues or contraindications to other lymphedema treatments -Improvement was seen in outcomes ofupper extremity volume circumferential measurements, ROM, upper extremity and grip strength, pain and discomfort, QOL, and cost \u2013Authors of asystematic review published in 2018 concluded that KT was effective in treatment of lymphedema in patients with breast cancer, but it was not more effective than other methods (i.e., complete decongestive therapy andmanual lymphatic drainage)(50) \u203aSee Description and Indications of device/equipment and Guidelines for use of device/equipment above .
