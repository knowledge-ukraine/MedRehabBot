            "The glenoid labrum is a ring of cartilage that surrounds the glenoid fossa and improves the fit of the humeral head. The superior part of the labrum is more mobile, whereas the interior part is considered the \u201canchor.\u201d The superior and anterosuperior portions of the labrum have less vascularity compared with other regions. Blood is supplied to the labrum via the suprascapular, circumflex scapular, and posterior humeral arteries(8)",
            "The long head of the biceps brachii inserts into the superior labrum. Labrum lesions can result from repetitive movements (i.e., atraumatic) or from acute trauma(8)",

This test indicates shoulder instability \u2013Dynamic shear test \u2013 Patient is standing, arm is placed in an arc of 80\u2013120\u00b0  while physical therapist applies anteriorly directed force on the shoulder. Positive tests elicit pain in superior and posterior directions -Researchers found the dynamic labral shear test (DLST) to be sensitive but not specific in diagnosing SLAP lesions without concomitant injury in the shoulder(7) \u2013Biceps load test \u2013 Patient in supine, arm abducted to 90\u00b0, and forearm supinated. The arm is then externally rotated. External rotation is stopped if apprehension occurs with external rotation. The patient is then asked to flex the elbow while the examiner resists elbow flexion. If apprehension remains the same or worsens, this is a positive test for a SLAP lesion. In a variation of this test, the biceps load test II, the arm is elevated to 120\u00b0 and maximally externally rotated with the elbow flexed to 90\u00b0. Elbow flexion is then resisted; if this elicits pain, the test is positive for a SLAP lesion. In clinical studies, sensitivity ranged from 89.7% to 90.9% and specificity was 96.9%(1) \u2013Compression-rotation  test \u2013 With patient in supine, shoulder is abducted to 90\u02da with elbow flexed to 90\u02da; compression force applied and then rotated to trap torn labrum.

If the patient has sudden posterior shoulder pain, the test is positive for a posteroinferior labral lesion \u2013Internal rotation resistance strength test - apparent weakness on strength testing of internal versus external rotation of the arm, when held in 90\u00b0 of abduction and 80\u00b0 to 85\u00b0 of external rotation \u2013Jerk test \u2013 The patient is seated with his or her arm internally rotated and abducted 90\u00b0, elbow extended. The examiner grasps the elbow and loads the humerus proximally. The arm is then adducted in the horizontal plane. A sudden jerk or clunk indicates a posteroinferior labrum lesion \u2013Crank test \u2013 With the patient seated, the affected shoulder is elevated to 160\u00b0 in the scapular plane. The joint is loaded along the axis of the humerus by the examiner with one hand, while the other hand rotates the humerus. A positive test for glenoid labrum tear is identified either by pain (with or without clicking) or reproduction of the patient\u2019s symptoms, usually while externally rotating the humerus.(1) The test should be repeated in supine position \u2013Relocation (Jobe\u2019s) test \u2013 With the patient supine, the shoulder is positioned in abducted and maximal externally rotated position. Posteriorly directed force is exerted on the proximal humerus. Pain on release of the posterior force is a positive test for labrum tear \u2013Anterior slide test \u2013 With the patient seated and hand on hip, an anterior force is exerted on the elbow while proximal stabilization is provided.
