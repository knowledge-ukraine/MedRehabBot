            "The term kyphosis, when indicating a condition, refers to excessive anterior concavity of the thoracic spine (> 50\u00b0).(3,10) The terms kyphotic deformity, hyperkyphosis, and excessive thoracic kyphosis (ETK) are often used to specify a kyphosis that is excessive in order to differentiate it from normal kyphosis(3) \u2013For purposes of this Clinical Review, the term kyphosis refers to a backward curve exceeding normal values",

If full correction cannot be achieved, it is called fixed or structural(3) \u2013Postural or flexible kyphosis is typically a cosmetic concern, although it can be associated with back pain, and rarely requires bracing or surgery(3)",

The cervical hyperlordosis resultsin a forward head posturing. In more severe cases, often those resulting from osteoporosis, the head might need to bepositioned into severe capital and cervical extension for the patient to look ahead of himself or herself for gait and otheractivities. This compensatory posturing results in a tightening of posterior neck musculature, thereby limiting overallcervical flexion\u2013The anterior muscles of the chest, including the pectoralis minor and major, become tightened, and the shoulders becomerounded and internally rotated\u2013The musculature of the upper back becomes stretched and weakened, contributing to abducted scapulae, roundedshoulders, and slouched posturing\u2013The hip flexors (iliopsoas) might become tightened and shortened, resulting in hip flexion contracture, further reducingthe patient\u2019s ability to stand upright\u2013In cases in which severe kyphotic deformity exists, patients sometimes experience difficulty breathing due to a structuralrestriction of the lungs or breathe inefficiently, relying on accessory muscles"

For these patients, an anterior, posterior, or combined anterior/posterior spinal fusion is performed(1,27) Posterior fixation alone is not always sufficient for long-term  spinal stabilization and can be not as effective in preventing late kyphotic deformity in patients with thoracolumbar fractures. An anterior or combined anteriorposterior  approach is indicated with a TKA > 2530\u00b0  and presence of a pedicle fracture due to the high degree of instability Posterior laminectomy or laminoplasty with instrumented fusion are surgical interventions for treatment of degenerative cervical kyphosis with stenotic myelopathy(13) Researchers in Japan who conducted an RCT found that corrective spinal surgery for kyphosis in postmenopausal women was not as effective as nonoperative treatment for improvement of spinal alignment and quality of life(17) Bracing can be used to reduce pain and limit progression of the curve.
