No significant improvement was seen in Functional Reach Test, single-leg  standing on right leg, 30-second chair stand, and fear of falling as measured by Iconographical Falls Efficacy Scale (Icon FES) \u2013NWF is a valid and safe tool for improving postural control and gait in older frail adults(15) \u2013Results of a 2018 RCT study of 65 year old adults with type II diabetes while participating in a 12 week study have concluded that utilizing the Wii Fit- exercise program led to a decrease in falls which improved overall reaction times, lower limb proprioception, and general balance ability(16) -Sixty five older adults with Type II DM were randomized to either the experimental group or control group -Study continued for 12- weeks for 40 \u2013 minute sessions",
            "Neurological rehabilitation \u2013Authors of a prospective RCT conducted in the United States concluded that the NWF can be utilized to improve balance in community dwelling older veterans(14) -Thirty community-dwelling  veterans were equally randomized as part of an 8-week  study to determine the effects of NWF on balance -Objective measures used in this study were the BBS, subjective measures of fear of falling, physical activity enjoyment, and quality of life and were measured at baseline, at 4 weeks, and at 8 weeks -Groups participating in the NWF exercise group showed significant improvements on the BBS after 8 weeks compared to the control group \u2013Researchers who published a systematic review with meta-analysis  in 2015 found that exergaming might be an appropriate therapeutic tool for improving balance and postural control in older adults, but that more large-scale trials are needed to determine if this is also the case for patients with idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease (IPD)(7) \u2013Researchers who published a systematic review in 2014 found that exergaming is feasible in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease; however, more research is needed to establish its safety and clinical effectiveness, especially for use in the home(9) \u2013Researchers in the United States who conducted a small study on the effects of dual-task  training on patients with chronic stroke with hemiparesis found significant improvements in balance, reaction time, postural control, and cognitive abilities, as well as a decrease in cognitive-motor  interference(12) -Eight community-dwelling  individuals with chronic stroke participated -Intervention: cognitive-motor  training consisted of the performance of the NWF in conjunction with cognitive training (e.g., memory tasks) -Researchers advise that more studies with larger sample sizes are needed \u2013United States researchers evaluated the effectiveness of using the NWF to increase physical activity levels in adults with multiple sclerosis(4) -Thirty adults participated in a 14-week  NWF home exercise program -Subjects were interviewed pre and post treatment intervention -Subjects reported that the NWF program helped build confidence in their abilities to achieve their goals related to leisure activities and reduce anxiety associated with participating in exercises at a gym -Subjects also reported initial concerns regarding fear of falling using NWF -Researchers concluded that NWF was limited in its customizability to accommodate subjects\u2019 different functional levels",
            "Strength \u2013Authors of a 2016 RCT study conducted in Taiwan have suggested that the Wii Fit balance game can improve static balance and lower extremity strength in individuals with intellectual disabilities(17) -Twenty-  four students with an intellectual disability were randomized to either the Wii Fit balance group (n = 8), sedentary group (n = 8), or physical education group (n = 8)  -Those in the Wii Fit balance group participated in an 8 week, 40 minute session twice a week. Physical education group underwent standard physical education that consisted of jogging and jump roping -Objective measures used in this study included the TUG, single limb stance, and speed strength index -Results indicate that those in the Wii Fit balance group had significant improvements in all of the objective measures including the one leg stance, moving speed, TUG, and speed strength index. Those in the PE group showed improvements but were not considered significant .
