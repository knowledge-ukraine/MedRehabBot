            "Variations in signs and symptoms:  Signs and symptoms of aphasia will vary greatly depending upon the specific location of brain injury, the type of aphasia, the severity of aphasia, and the amount of time that has passed since the initial brain injury.(1,2) Patients with aphasia can also have dysarthria, apraxia, and/or dysphagia, which will lead to further variations in patient presentation.(1) For detailed information, please see the series of Clinical Reviews on dysarthria, acquired apraxia, and dysphagia. Cognitive deficits in the areas of attention, perception, pattern detection, categorization, dual-processing, problem solving, and/or memory can also be present in aphasia. When a bilingual person is affected by aphasia, it is highly likely that language impairments will be present in both (or all) of his or her languages and that the type of aphasia will  be the same in both languages (e.g., the patient will demonstrate expressive aphasia in English and Spanish) even if the severity is not.(2,5) Specific manifestation of symptoms will vary between the patient\u2019s languages due to differences in form and structure of those languages. For example, symptoms of agrammatism will vary according to each language\u2019s syntax.(2,6) For detailed information on symptoms associated with specific types of aphasia, see the series of Clinical Reviews on aphasia",
            "Recovery patterns: The recovery pattern of bilingual patients with aphasia may be quite variable (often termed \u201cdifferential recovery\u201d). Recovery patterns typically seen among bilingual patients during the acute recovery phase (i.e., up to 4 weeks after aphasia begins) include: 1) dramatic improvements across both of the patient\u2019s languages, 2) notably different levels of recovery between the patient\u2019s two languages, and 3) periods of improvement in both languages mixed with periods of greater recovery in one language.(7) The terms \u201cparallel recovery\u201d and \u201cnonparallel recovery\u201d are also used to describe language skills and recovery in bilingual patients with aphasia. In parallel recovery, following brain injury a patient\u2019s relative abilities in language 1 and 2 (L1 and L2) are the same as his or her abilities in those languages prior to aphasia. For example, if a patient was more fluent in Hmong than English prior to the onset of aphasia, he or she will remain so following the onset of aphasia. In nonparallel recovery, one of a patient\u2019s languages is more impacted by aphasia than the other and the proficiency in one language relative to the other may be different than before the onset of aphasia(2)",
            "Translation abilities: A patient\u2019s translation abilities often are affected by aphasia. Translation impairments include 1) inability to translate (patient is unable to translate to or from either language), 2) spontaneous translation (patient translates messages involuntarily and is unable to refrain from translating his or her own utterances or the utterances of others), 3) translation without comprehension (patient is able to perform translations quickly but does not comprehend the meaning of the message), and 4) paradoxical translation (patient is able to translate in one language but not the other)(6)",
            "Language mixing : Following the onset of aphasia, bilingual patients may exhibit unintentional language mixing. Although code switching is an appropriate mixing of two languages frequently used by nonaphasic bilingual persons, in aphasia the patient sometimes mixes languages in a more random, undesirable way, possibly due to decreased cognitive control of language output.(2,7,29)Additionally, code switching might be used by patients with nonfluent aphasia to improve fluency and grammaticality.(32) Recovery varies across language process (e.g., syntax, semantics, phonology) and modalities (e.g., spoken language, gesture).(7) Code switching should not be discouraged when it allows the patient to maximize communication abilities with multiple communication partners(26) Causes, Pathogenesis, & Risk Factors"

The environment can be considered in terms of 1) factors that inhibit patient participation in family and community events and factors that support patient participation and 2) which language(s) is/are used to fulfill which communicative intentions. An SLP will focus on factors that inhibit or support the patient\u2019s ability to communicate in a variety of environments and contexts. These factors include 1) products and technology (e.g., an AAC device), 2) support and relationships (e.g., family members who speak the patient\u2019s L1 and L2), and 3) attitude (e.g., the patient\u2019s/family\u2019s view of the communication impairment and the patient\u2019s role in family/community events).(2) When considering communication intention, the SLP must consider which language(s) the patient used to communicate needs and wants, transfer information, establish and maintain social closeness, and convey social etiquette(2,19)Gather information on the patient\u2019s premorbid use of language -Obtain information about order of acquisition of each language and language history (e.g., languages used as a child in school and in the home)(20) -Which language is used in different situations (e.g., work, home, with relatives, with friends)?(20) -What modalities are used in each language (e.g., reading, speaking, writing)?(20) -Premorbid proficiency in each language can be compared to present proficiency using a 7-point scale (e.g., 1 = not fluent, 7 = native proficiency)(4)If a patient was proficient in more than one language, he or she should complete spoken and written translations as part of the language assessment. Results of translation activities will provide information on the integrity of cross-linguistic links and the degree of cognitive control maintained over the patient\u2019s language system (i.e., is the patient able to prevent unintentional code-switching?)(2) ",

Careful consideration should be given to whether or not apraxia of speech (AOS) or dysarthria is a comorbid condition. For detailed information on theT708586. For detailed information on the evaluation of dysarthria, please see the series of Clinical Reviews on dysarthria \u2013Language -Areas of language that should be tested when aphasia is suspected include auditory comprehension, language production, reading, writing, confrontation naming, automatic speech production, and repetitions of words and sentences. These language domains should be assessed in each language that the patient previously used. Performance on measures of word retrieval in bilingual patients with aphasia is influenced by premorbid language proficiency.(30)Naming accuracy will be higher for a bilingual person with aphasia in the language in which he or she was more proficient prior to the onset of aphasia.(31) The following tests might be appropriate to use with patients witha test that measures the functional communication skills of adults with communication disorders such as aphasia. Areas assessed include social communication; communication of basic needs; reading, writing, and number concepts; and daily planning.(15) Since the ASHA FACS is available only in English and has been field-tested  only on English-speaking  subjects, the SLP would need to adapt this subjective measure for use with bilingual patients(2) allows subjective comparison of a patient\u2019s current proficiency in L1 and L2 to premorbid levels of proficiency in each language. A 5-point  scale is used to rate auditory comprehension, language production, confrontation naming, repetition, reading, writing, automatic speech tasks, translating into L1/ L2, and speech intelligibility. Functional code-switching  and unintentional language switching are also assessed subjectively(2)tests a wide range of language skills (e.g., spontaneous speech, verbal auditory discrimination, word repetition, naming, reading of words and sentences) and has been adapted (rather than translated) for use in dozens of languages(16)authors of a study conducted in South Africa with 10 bilingual individuals with aphasia (and 19 controls) found that combining the Comprehensive Aphasia Test (CAT) with a non-verbal  assessment of executive functioning was helpful for determining an appropriate treatment plan. Bilingual individuals with aphasia who have lasting executive functioning deficits often have more severe communication impairment. Additionally, determining the extent of executive functioning impairment will inform the treating SLP\u2019s plan of care(33)Assess vocal quality and other appropriate voice parameters (such as intensity, pitch, and range); neurological impairment can affect vocal quality; if necessary, refer to otolaryngologist (ENT) to rule out laryngeal pathologyDocument the presence of stuttering; neurological impairment can result in stuttering behaviors and has been reported in bilingual patients with aphasia(17) -For detailed information on stuttering and disorders of fluency, see the series of Clinical Reviews on this topicAssess reading skills as part of a comprehensive evaluation of language abilities; assess in both languages and note any differences. Standardized assessments of reading are included in many of the assessments of aphasia -Some bilingual individuals are fluent in more than one spoken language; however, they never learned to read and write in more than one language. It is important to document the patient\u2019s prior abilities in each language with respect to reading and writing before assessing his or her current reading and writing abilities(18) -Some subtests of language tests include a reading or phonological awareness component; for patients who were nonliterate in a specific language prior to the onset of aphasia, performance in these subtests can make a patient appear more impaired than he or she actually is(18)",

            "In an effort to determine the effectiveness of aphasia therapy for the bilingual patient, authors of a review reported on 15 articles (2 of which were systematic reviews) that addressed the topic.(28) Findings from this review were: \u2013Language production in both healthy and aphasic bilingual individuals is affected by cross-linguistic  transfer (i.e., each language in the patient\u2019s system influences the production of the other languages). For this reason, cross-linguistic transfer concepts are incorporated into bilingual aphasia therapy. Although the effects of cross-linguistic  transfer do not appear to be universal, there is some evidence that when cognates and clangs are targeted in one language during bilingual aphasia therapy for word retrieval, there can be generalization to the other language. Cognates are phonologically similar words with the same meaning (e.g., \u201ctiger\u201d in English and \u201ctigre\u201d in French) and clangs are phonologically similar words with different meanings (e.g., \u201cbell\u201d in English is a metal instrument that makes a ringing sound when hit,and \u201cbelle\u201d in French means beautiful).There is conflicting evidence about whether training of noncognates, which are words with the  same meaning but different pronunciation (e.g., \u201cbutterfly\u201d in English is \u201cpapillon\u201d in French), in bilingual persons with aphasia results in cross-linguistic generalization.(28)Review authors also reported evidence for cross-linguistic  transfer effects when there is considerable overlap between syntactic elements (e.g., pronoun and gender agreement) of a bilingual patient\u2019s languages(28) \u2013The evidence for determining in which language therapy should be provided is mixed. In multiple studies reviewed, authors found evidence to support cross-linguistic  therapy effects when aphasia therapy was provided in the language in which the patient was less proficient prior to onset of aphasia (i.e., generalization of therapeutic gains to the more proficient, but untreated, language).(28) In other studies, findings supported targeting the language in which the patient is more proficient after the onset of aphasia (i.e., less severely impaired by aphasia)(28) \u2013Using translation from one of the patient\u2019s languages to the other as a therapy task might enhance the overall effects of bilingual aphasia therapy, especially in cases in which the patient\u2019s cognitive control mechanism is damaged(28) \u2013Semantic Feature Analysis (SFA) and phonological cueing appear to enhance the effects of cross-linguistic  transfer in anomia therapy for bilingual patients with aphasia.(28) For detailed information on anomia therapy, see Clinical Review\u2026 Anomia Associated with Aphasia ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T708611",
            "Aphasia treatment models \u2013Medical model: Treatment focuses on the individual patient\u2019s communication deficits. Therapy activities target recovering, relearning, or compensating for impaired communication abilities(2) \u2013Social model: Intervention focuses on examining the ways in which a patient\u2019s environment facilitates or inhibits his or her ability to communicate. Persons, places, and things typically present in the patient\u2019s environment are incorporated into treatment activities(2) \u2013In order to maximize treatment outcomes, elements of the medical and social models should be combined(2) \u2013Decisions about which language to target in treatment should respect the linguistic context and personal goals of the patient. If it is important that patient maintain bilingual communication abilities, aphasia therapy should incorporate both (or all) languages in which the patient previously communicated(2)",
            "Language-based  intervention \u2013None of the patient\u2019s languages should be excluded from therapy, for several reasons: -Without the ability to use one or more languages, the patient may become isolated from his or her family and home community. Therefore, both the majority language (often spoken by the SLP) and the patient\u2019s home language(s) should be targeted during intervention(2) -Published research indicates that lexical-semantic links between a patient\u2019s two languages can be used to strengthen skills in both languages during aphasia treatment. When treatment incorporates elements shared by both of the patient\u2019s languages (e.g., cognates, word pairs that are similar in form and meaning, such as English \u201ctelephone\u201d and Spanish \u201ctelefono\u201d), treatment gains can be maximized(2) -Bilingual patients with aphasia who unintentionally mix languages might be exhibiting difficulty with the underlying cognitive control of language rather than a linguistic or pragmatic impairment. Therefore, when a patient mixes two languages within an utterance, the utterance should be examined for meaning (rather than analyzed for linguistic form) and recast in a meaningful way(2)",
            "In a study of 3 bilingual patients with aphasia conducted in the United States, researchers found that cross-linguistic generalization occurs following treatment focusing on semantic naming.(4) Patients received semantic training in English or Spanish. Following the period of treatment, patients demonstrated improved naming abilities in both languages; however, the patients showed different patterns of generalization. When patients received treatment in the language they were most proficient in premorbidly, they displayed improvements in naming on tasks in that language but not in the other language. When patients received semantic training in their less proficient language, naming skills improved in that language as well as in their most proficient language 4)",
            "Cognitive-based  treatment approaches \u2013When viewed from a cognitive perspective, the symptoms of aphasia are considered to result from damage to underlying cognitive processes such as attention, perception, pattern detection, categorization, problem solving, and memory. Therefore, it is believed that intervention focused on strengthening these cognitive skills will directly lead to improved language or will strengthen the cognitive underpinnings required for language use(5)  \u2013In a case study based upon a cognitive perspective, researchers studied the effects of nonlinguistic information tasks on gains in language performance in one bilingual English-Spanish  patient (a 62-year-old  man with transcortical motor aphasia and accompanying cognitive weakness). Treatment focusing on nonverbal skills occurred over a 2-month  period; consisted of 14 1-hour  sessions; and included visual scanning, card sorting, and math computation activities. Following treatment, the patient exhibited significant gains on cognitive tasks and modest gains in both languages(5)",
            "Environment-based  treatment approaches \u2013Although informational material on aphasia is widely available in English, it may be difficult to obtain in other languages. Therefore, families who are not proficient in English might have difficulty understanding the patient\u2019s impairment and its effect on communication and/or cognition. Part of the SLP\u2019s role might be finding aphasia resources in the family\u2019s home language or educating a translator/interpreter about aphasia so that they can then communicate this information to the family. The SLP should also ensure that the family is educated about the risk of depression in patients with aphasia and the effect that depression can have on therapy progress(2) \u2013SLPs should educate other healthcare workers on the nature of language mixing in bilingual patients with aphasia. Healthcare providers unfamiliar with bilingual aphasia might at times believe the patient is using jargon when he or she is mixing languages and attempting to convey a meaningful message(2) \u2013A bilingual Ilocano/English-speaking  man with aphasia and his wife participated in \u201cConducting Conversation\u201d (CC) aphasia therapy in a case study. In CC therapy, interactions between the patient and his wife were targeted, rather than interactions between the patient and the SLP. During treatment sessions, the patient and his wife were taught techniques to use to improve communication and activities were conducted in English; however, daily 20-minute  practice sessions were done in Ilocano, a language spoken in the Philippines. Following 8 weeks of treatment and home practice, the patient showed improvements in verbal output and coherence plus decreased need for conversational repair. Although home practice was conducted in Ilocano, results were obtained only on changes in English conversation(26) .

This approach focuses on conversation between the patient and someone other than the SLP. Communication strategies taught through CC include use of gestures, use of circumlocution when experiencing word retrieval difficulty, and use of requests for clarification when misunderstandings occur(26)Persons in the patient\u2019s environment will become more supportive of patient\u2019s communicationTo be implemented in a variety of environments encountered by the"
