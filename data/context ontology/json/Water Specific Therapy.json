            "The Halliwick Concept was first conceived as a strategy to teach swimming to individuals with disabilities.(1,2,14) The concept was devised by a swimming coach and focuses on structuring activities in the water in a progressive way. Emphasis is placed on breath control and control of rotations in the aquatic environment(1,2,16)",
            "When Halliwick was first developed it was called the Halliwick Method. The name has been changed to Halliwick Concept to suggest a broader framework in which Halliwick can be applied(3,14)",
            "The Halliwick Concept is now used for therapeutic activities as well as for traditional swimming instruction(3,16)",
            "The Halliwick Concept emphasizes the benefits of activities in water, including physical, recreational, and social interaction \u2013The participants\u2019 enjoyment of the activity is believed to enhance the learning",
            "The goal is to enable the participant to achieve maximum independence both in the water and on land",
            "Manual assistance from an able-bodied  instructor, requiring a one-on-one  approach, is used. Withdrawal of assistance (disengagement) occurs as the participant progresses. Flotation aids are never used(16)",
            "Many activities take place in groups \u2013Although one-on-one  pairing is the standard, pairs work in groups to provide socialization, peer interaction, and opportunity for development of skills in game activities(4)"
