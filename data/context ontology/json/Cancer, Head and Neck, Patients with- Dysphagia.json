            "Dysphagia refers to a difficulty in swallowing due to an inability to move food efficiently during the oral, pharyngeal, or esophageal phases of swallowing. The oral phase includes sucking, chewing, and moving the food or liquid into the throat. The pharyngeal phase is the initiation of the swallowing reflex, when the food is squeezed down the throat and the airway is closed off to prevent aspiration (food or liquid entering the airway) or choking. In the esophageal phase, the openings at the top and bottom of the esophagus move the food or liquid to the stomach by relaxing and tightening.(1) Dysphagia can occur as a result of the disease itself and after patients have treatment for cancer of the head and/or neck that affects the lips, oral cavity, pharynx, or larynx. Radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and surgery or a combination of these procedures can result in some degree of dysphagia in the oral preparatory and/or the pharyngeal phases of the swallow.(2) Signs and symptoms of dysphagia associated with head and neck cancer vary according to the site and management of cancer",

            "Head and neck cancers usually begin with cells in the mucosal surfaces of the head and/or neck areas. These areas includethe oral cavity, the salivary glands, the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity, the pharynx, the larynx, and the lymph nodesin the upper part of the neck.(3) Treatment for head and neck cancer often leads to dysphagia and its complications.Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube (G-tube) feeding might be required post treatment for the patient to maintainadequate nutrition. Severe mucositis (injury to the oral and/or pharyngeal mucosa), sepsis (severe inflammatory responseby the whole body), malnutrition, and death can occur during or after cancer treatment(5)\u2013In a retrospective review study conducted in the United States with data from 297 patients who were concurrently treatedfor head and neck cancer with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and chemotherapy, researchers found that theoverall risk for a need for a G-tube  (i.e., because of severe to profound dysphagia) was low. Of the patients in this study,128 did not receive a prophylactic G-tube  prior to cancer treatment, and of those 128 only 15 (11.7%) ended up requiringthe G-tube  during or within 3 months of chemoradiation. Researchers found that the following factors increased the riskof needing a G-tube  during or immediately after chemoradiation: BMI of less than 25, accelerated irradiation fractionation(described below), tumor T classification of 3 or higher, and a cumulative cisplatin (a chemotherapy drug) dose of 200mg/m2 or higher(43)\u2013Authors of a systematic review of literature that included 10 articles on swallowing disturbances after radiation treatmentfor head and neck cancer reported that the average dose of radiation to the pharyngeal constrictor muscles is the bestpredictor of late swallowing disturbances.(49)Recommendations for physicians based on the results from this systematicreview were to keep the radiation dose to the pharyngeal constrictor muscles as low as possible given the patient\u2019s cancerand response to radiation and to refrain from overdosage to this area. There were many methodological issues in thestudies included in this review which review authors reported kept them from drawing any further conclusions"

There was no difference in weight loss oroncologic outcomes between the groups(50)-Late dependency on percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG)tubes is associated with poorer overall survival rates.In a study conducted in the United States, patients who were dependent on the PEG for nutrition following curativetreatment for head and neck cancer had lower rates of overall survival as compared to patients who were not dependenton the PEG.

Patients should also be advised on the possibility of impaired swallow function and the rationale for dysphagia therapy after treatment for cancer. A pretreatment swallow assessment is indicated for all patients with head and neck cancer to identify those at high risk of posttreatment dysphagia; this assessment can guide the physician in treatment decisions (such as organ preservation versus resection)(11) Authors of a review of literature regarding the role of an SLP for patients with head and neck cancer reported that best evidence strongly supports an active role for the SLP beginning at the time of cancer diagnosis. With respect to pretreatment role, the SLP should perform a baseline instrumental swallow assessment to determine the most appropriate intervention plan.(40) The best evidence also supports the use of prophylactic swallowing treatment (i.e., before symptoms of dysphagia present) to help prevent dysphagia (or lessen its severity) and improve functional, long-term outcomes after cancer treatment",

Due to its limitations, a CSE should be used as a complement to other instrumental measures rather than in isolation.(17) Ingestion of food or fluid is not routinely included in a CSE; however, if oral intake is considered relatively safe, the patient can be observed swallowing different consistencies of food and water(22) -A comprehensive case history and review of medical records(10) -Assessment of oral structures and motor function.

Study sample included 85 patients with head and neck cancer who received either radiation therapy or chemoradiation therapy (CRT) between 2007 and 2012. The SPP included a pretreatment swallow evaluation and education session in which the researchers explained the rationale for pretreatment/continued swallow exercises and demonstrated the exercises. Protocol consisted of the following:  gargling liquid for 10 seconds 10 times, effortful swallow 10 times, Mendelsohn maneuver 10 times, \u201cchug-a-lug\u201d  3 ounces at once, tongue protrusion 10 times, tongue press 10 times, and Shaker exercise 3 times. The entire protocol was to be performed daily 3 times (except Shaker, which was only included once a day). Subjects were classified into 2 groups: compliant or noncompliant with SPP. Compliance was based on self-report  as documented by a tracking sheet brought to weekly sessions. In the weekly SPP sessions, the researchers documented the diet for each subject as regular (chewable), puree, liquid, or G-tube dependent, and documented compliance with the SPP. Outcome measures were taken at 1 and 2 months posttreatment, during which time subjects were instructed to continue exercises. At the conclusion of cancer treatments, 57 subjects were considered compliant and 28 were noncompliant with the SPP during their cancer treatment. The compliant group had a significantly higher percentage of subjects on a regular diet (54.4% vs 21.4%), a significantly lower rate of dependence on a G-tube  (22.8% vs 53.6%), and a significantly higher rate of maintaining or improving their diet (54.4% vs 25.0%) compared to noncompliant subjects(44) \u2013Shaker exercise (strengthening exercise for the suprahyoid muscle): Instruct the patient to lie flat on the bed or floor and perform 3 sustained head raisings for 1 minute in the supine position, separated by a 1-minute  rest period.(29) Instruct patient to then raise the head 30 consecutive times in the same supine position.

Patient should perform these exercises 3 times a day for 6 weeks \u2013For detailed information on exercises for dysphagia treatment, see Clinical Review\u2026Dysphagia: Swallowing Therapy, Facilitative ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T709080 and Clinical Review\u2026Dysphagia: Swallowing Therapy, Indirect ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T709045",
            "Feeding tubes/enteral feeding:  Patients who have just had treatment for head or neck cancer may be unable to take adequate nutrition and hydration by mouth. In these cases, the use of a G-tube  may be indicated while the patient recovers. The SLP should educate the family or caregivers about the implications of feeding tube use as well as determine how complications should be addressed if they arise. The transition from a G-tube  to oral feeding is best facilitated by a transdisciplinary team that includes at minimum a registered dietician and an SLP \u2013There is a growing body of evidence that suggests placement/use of a prophylactic G-tube  in patients undergoing treatment for head and neck cancer is related to development of more severe dysphagia than in patients who do not receive a G-tube.(8,9)There is also research that indicates no difference in long-term  swallowing outcomes in cases of prophylactic placement of a G-tube.(46) When the medical team is determining if the patient is an appropriate candidate for a G-tube,  the patient\u2019s individual characteristics and risk factors should be considered",
            "Intraoral prosthetics:  A prosthodontist may recommend a prosthetic for a patient who has had surgical resection in the oral cavity. The following are common prosthetics for patients who have had oral resections:(2) \u2013Maxillary reshaping prostheses: To reshape and recontour the palatal vault so that the tongue can make contact with the palate during speech and swallowing \u2013Obturators: To separate the oral and nasal cavities to prevent loss of food or liquid into the nasal cavity",
            "Range of motion exercises:  ROM exercises have been designed to improve impaired swallow function after surgical treatment of cancer or fibrosis (scarring) after radiation. The purpose of these exercises is to extend the motion of the structure (e.g., tongue, jaw, lips) in a target direction as far as possible by holding the posture for 1 to 2 seconds and then releasing it \u2013The patient may experience trismus (restricted mouth opening) after a resection to the jaw or radiation.(36) Exercises include unassisted ROM exercises, finger-assisted jaw exercises, stacked tongue depressors (slowly adding one at a time to increase jaw opening), or a device that assists patient in performing exercises (TheraBite). Examples of unassisted jaw exercises include having the patient open the mouth as wide as possible, extending the jaw to one side as far as possible, and moving the lower jaw in a circular motion \u2013For detailed information on exercises for dysphagia treatment, see Clinical Review\u2026Dysphagia: Swallowing Therapy, Facilitative , referenced above and Clinical Review\u2026Dysphagia: Swallowing Therapy, Indirect , referenced above",
            "Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) : NMES therapy is designed to deliver electrical stimulation to key muscles involved in swallowing for the purpose of retraining and strengthening these muscles, thereby improving swallow function. The electrical stimulation depolarizes the nerve at the neuromuscular junction, resulting in muscle contraction and increased blood flow to the muscles being stimulated. The evidence for NMES in patients with dysphagia is mixed. This therapy might not be appropriate depending on the underlying cause of dysphagia (i.e., stroke versus head and neck cancer). Authors of a 5-year,  16-site,  RCT conducted in the United States with 170 participants who had dysphagia resulting from head and neck cancer investigated the difference in outcomes between an electrical stimulation group and a sham electrical stimulation group. Participants in both groups were also assigned swallowing exercises. Researchers tracked whether the participants were compliant (performing prescribed exercises at least 10/12 times per week) or  noncompliant using checklists. Researchers found that, in the compliant group, participants in the exercise only (sham electrical stimulation) group had significantly better penetration-aspiration  scale (PAS) scores compared to the compliant electrical stimulation + exercise group. Overall, the compliant and noncompliant participants in each group did not have significantly different outcomes and researchers questioned whether exercises in patients with head and neck cancer were indicated as part of dysphagia treatment at all. Electrical stimulation resulted in worse outcomes regardless of compliance status(52)",
            "Combination therapy : In a small RCT conducted in China, researchers found that the combination of traditional exercise therapy, NMES, and balloon dilatation (a procedure in which the physician inserts a ballooning endoscope into the throat to stretch a narrowed esophagus) resulted in superior outcomes compared to traditional exercise therapy alone.(38) Sixty patients who were treated for nasopharyngeal cancer with radiation therapy and in whom radiation-induced  dysphagia was diagnosed were included in the study. All patients were treated with lingual, pharyngeal, and laryngeal exercises performed 15 times each 3 times per day. In the treatment group, patients were also treated with NMES and balloon dilatation according to individual treatment protocols based on individual needs and swallowing abilities. After 4 months of therapy, the patients\u2019 swallowing function was reassessed by a therapist who did not take part in the rehabilitation of these patients. The WST and a VFSS were used as baseline and outcome measures. Outcome measures indicated that the total efficacy rate in the treatment group was significantly higher than in the control group (83.9% vs. 62.1%). However, there were 2 individuals in the treatment group whose swallowing deteriorated after treatment, and none in the control group experienced this. Additionally, because this was a very small study and the head and neck cancer population is so diverse, findings should be interpreted with caution. In order to more definitively determine the efficacy of this type of treatment, larger RCTs should be conducted(38)",
