            "Hamstring strain (HS) is the main reason for posterior thigh musculotendinous pain associated with physical activity. It is among the most common sports-related  injuries, with increased risk in sports that involve sprinting, kicking, or high-speed  skilled movements. HS injuries account for 12\u201326%  of injuries in American football, Australian rules football, soccer, rugby, and track and field. HS is responsible for significant time loss from practice and play for athletes(3,7,19)",
            "The biceps femoris long head is often involved with high-speed injuries.(8,11)The site of injury is usually proximal either at the musculotendinous junction (MTJ) (60\u201385%  of all hamstring injuries)or at the ischial tuberosity attachment. Longer recovery times are associated with proximity to the ischial tuberosity.(9,11,19)However, mid-thigh  or distal HS is not uncommon(7)",
            "Strong evidence supports knee flexor eccentric exercise training for HS rehabilitation and for reducing the risk of HS injury. This type of training is associated with increased biceps femoris long head fascicle length and eccentric hamstring strength(10)"

            "Overstretching with tearing of one or more of the hamstring muscles is the apparent mechanism of injury(9,21)\u2013Sprinting-In sprinters, eccentric activity (contraction that slows lengthening) of the hamstrings during repeated high-speedstrides is part of the etiology. Biceps femoris muscle activity has been measured to be almost twice that of thesemimembranosus and semitendinosus muscles during the terminal swing phase of gait in sprinting. This is likely dueto eccentric loading of the biceps femoris to decelerate the swing leg. Thus it is suspected that HS occurs in sprintersduring this phase due to a lack of eccentric strength,neuromuscular control, or fatigue(9,21)-In sprinters, faulty lumbopelvic muscle coordination might allow excessive hamstring stretch in the late swing phase ofthe stride(21)-Muscle fatigue may reduce compliance to stretch. For example, decreased tendon compliance linked to muscle fatiguehas also been hypothesized(9)-Authors of an observational study (N = 8 male sprinters) in Japan found that forward trunk lean (vs. upright trunkposture) was associated with increased anterior pelvic tilt and that hip flexion in maximal sprinting might increasestretching of the hamstrings and load-bearing  with muscle elongation during the stance phase of running(2)\u2013Dancing and water skiing-In contrast to sprinting, most cases in dancers occur during slow and prolonged hip flexion beyond the normal rangewith the knee fully extended. Deficits in flexibility and strength are associated with both the mechanism of injury andgrade of strain, as is recovery time-Complete avulsion of the proximal hamstring from the ischial tuberosity is most common in waterskiers. This injuryoccurs with forced hip flexion while the knee remains in complete extension(21)"

            "The hemi-pennate  muscle fiber architecture (i.e., muscle fibers on opposite ends of the central tendon are parallel to eachother) of the semimembranosus and biceps femoris long head muscles may contribute to HS. Unlike the semitendinosusand biceps femoris short head, which have a fusiform and trapezoid muscle fiber architecture, respectively, excessiveelongation of the semimembranosus and/or biceps femoris long head is more likely to occur when the knee is extended andthe hip is flexed (8,21)",

        "treatment summary": [
            "Rehabilitation for acute HS \u2013Physical therapy interventions for promoting muscle rehabilitation in patients with HS have traditionally been in the form of protection, management of pain and swelling (cryotherapy), therapeutic exercises, and manual soft-tissue techniques(3) \u2013A rehabilitation protocol for early intervention in grade I and II HS, involving gentle stretching following cryotherapy, is more effective than cryotherapy alone in the improvement of passive knee ROM and function(18) \u2013Evidence is lacking to determine the effectiveness of electrophysical modalities (e.g., ultrasound, electrostimulation) for HS rehabilitation",
            "Stretching and flexibility exercises \u2013Stretching should include quadriceps,glutes, hip flexors, hamstrings, and calves(19)  \u2013Some practitioners prefer dynamic versus static stretching for increasing flexibility prior to activities requiring muscle performance because static stretching reduces muscle force and power(for up to 1 hour)(19,21)",
            "Agility and trunk stabilization exercises \u2013Running and agility drills should incorporate; speed drills, straight leg runs,changes of direction,decelerations, progressive speed exposure, maximum speed, and volume at maximum speed(19)",
            "Eccentric strengthening \u2013Eccentric exercise increases tension force on contracting muscle and, therefore, is indicated for hamstrings (especially the biceps femoris long head) strengthening to prevent overstretching in the terminal swing phase. Athletes with prior HS demonstrate reduced eccentric hamstrings strength and greater knee flexion angle at peak knee flexion torques. Eccentric strengthening of the hamstrings increases the knee flexion angle at which peak torque is achieved. Based on developing research, the growing consensus is that eccentric strengthening of the hamstrings should be integrated into the rehabilitation program to prevent reinjury(19,21) \u2013Authors of a current literature search (level-2  evidence or higher) on eccentric hamstring exercises to reduce hamstring strains in elite adult male soccer players found evidence that eccentric exercises can decrease hamstring strains(12) \u2013In a study, 50 athletes with a previous HS injury underwent a protocol emphasizing eccentric hamstring strength training with the hamstrings in a lengthened position. Four of the 50 athletes who sustained reinjury between 3 and 12 months after return to sport were noncompliant with the rehabilitation. The other 46 athletes had not sustained a reinjury at an average of 24 months after return to sport(16) \u2013The Nordic hamstring exercise is an effective preventive tool in combination with sport-specific  training. This exercise recruits the semitendinosus as well as the greatest activation of biceps femoris muscle compared with other hamstring exercises. A 10-week  program reduced incidence and recurrence of HS by 60% and 85%, respectively(19)",
            "Strengthening of the quadriceps and hamstrings \u2013The hamstring to quadriceps strength ratio is often used as a marker for predicting hamstring injuries. In a cohort study, 614 professional soccer players underwent isokinetic strength testing during preseason screening. During the season, 190 players suffered HS. There was a very small association between lower hamstring eccentric strength and lower quadriceps concentric strength. Authors concluded that hamstring to quadriceps strength ratio is a weak risk factor for HS(14) \u2013Hamstring to quadriceps strength ratio assessed during a fatigue test provided different outcomes than the traditional ratio. In a study in which 35 professional soccer players performed a 30-repetition  isokinetic fatigue test, authors concluded that knee flexion muscle fatigue was significantly greater than quadriceps fatigue(15)",
            "Neuromuscular reeducation exercise \u2013This component of rehabilitation is aimed at improving proprioception, agility, muscle recruitment, and balance",
            "Strength training for return to sport \u2013Evidence-based  strength training should focus on prevention of HS reinjury through eccentric knee flexor conditioning. The selection of exercises should be specific to in-sport muscle activation. Training interventions should also consider the impact on hamstring muscle architecture, morphology, and function(10) \u2013Rehabilitation programs should involve multidimensional exercise progression to create complex activities that are sport specific. Plyometric training will enhance sprinting and jumping performance and may reduce sprinting HS(19)",
