The optimal age for GH treatment as well as its appropriate duration in patients with TS is debated among medical professionals and in medical literature.(27) Per Clinical Guidelines developed at the 2016 Cincinnati International Turner Syndrome Meeting and endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics, recommendation is the early initiation of GH, by ages 4  6 years, if the child exhibits a growth failure or is already considerably short for her age(36,37) Use of GH might increase the risk of otitis media and joint disorders(6) Can be given in combination with androgen replacement(5,6) Multiple studies have found that the combination of androgen replacement therapy and GH replacement therapy will lower the frequency of the voice in patients with TS  In a cross-sectional  study conducted in Sweden of 117 women with TS who were controlled for karyotype and age, researchers found that androgen and GH replacement therapies normalized a highpitched  voice in these patients(8) In a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled,  double-blind  study conducted in the Netherlands including girls with TS aged 812  years, researchers found that the addition of oxandrolone (a synthetic derivative of testosterone) to a treatment regimen of GH lowered the frequency of the voice in girls with TS into the normal range(9) The voice frequency was lowered in a dose-dependent  manner; hence, if the resulting vocal pitch was found to be abnormally low, the dose of oxandrolone was reduced(9)",
