            "The term dementia refers to conditions in which a person gradually develops multiple cognitive deficits, including memory impairment, as a result of physiological changes caused by a general medical condition, persisting effects of a substance, or a combination of these factors.(1,2) Dementia does not refer to low intellectual functioning or intellectual disability (ID) as these are considered static conditions, whereas dementia represents a decline from previous functioning.(23) Dementia is not a normal condition of aging but rather a symptom of a disease process(3)",
            "According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,  fifth edition (DSM -5),dementia falls into the category of neurocognitive disorder (NCD), which is a group of disorders whose primary clinical deficit is decreased cognitive function and that are acquired rather than developmental. Dementia is now included in the entity \u201cmajor NCD.\u201d The term dementia can still be used in identifying subtypes, and may be used in settings in which physicians and patients are accustomed to using the term; however, NCD is the term now being advocated for use in identifying etiology (e.g., NCD due to Alzheimer disease, vascular NCD, NCD with Lewy bodies, NCD due to Parkinson disease, frontotemporal NCD, NCD due to TBI).The term major NCD is also preferable for cognitive impairment caused by conditions affecting younger persons such as TBI or HIV infection(1)",
            "Among persons with dementia 50\u201360%  have dementia of the Alzheimer type, whereas 15\u201330%  have vascular dementia(23)",
            "Some form of dementia is reported in about 1%\u20132%  of patients at age 65 and 30% at age 85(50)",
            "The DSM -5 also recognizes a less severe level of cognitive impairment, mild NCD, which was included in DSM -IV under Cognitive Disorders Not Otherwise Specified(1)",
            "Diagnosis of both major NCD and mild NCD requires evidence of significant cognitive decline from previous levels of performance in one or more cognitive domains\u2014i.e., complex attention, executive function, learning and memory, language, perceptual-motor function, or social cognition\u2014based on both of the following:(1) \u2013Concern of the individual or a family member (a knowledgeable informant) or the clinician that there has been a significant decline  \u2013An impairment in cognitive performance documented by standardized neuropsychological testing (or another quantified clinical assessment)",
            "In addition, for the diagnosis to be made, the cognitive deficits must interfere with independence in everyday activities, the cognitive deficits must not occur exclusively in the context of delirium, and the cognitive deficits cannot be better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., major depressive disorder, schizophrenia)(1)",
            "For purposes of this Clinical Review, the term dementia will be used",
            "Patients with dementia will have significant difficulty learning new information and may forget previously learned information and skills.(1) Initially, the memory impairment results in losing things or getting lost in unfamiliar settings; however, as the dementia progresses, the patient may start to forget his or her occupation, family members, birth date, and name(1)",
