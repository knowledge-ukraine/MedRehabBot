        "description": [
            "A cochlear implant (CI) is a small, partially implanted electronic device that provides a person who has profound hearing loss with a representation of sound from the environment. A CI contains components that are located outside of a person\u2019s body (external portion) as well as parts that are implanted (implanted portion). The external portion includes a microphone, a sound processor, and a transmitter system, which transmits speech signals to the receiver-stimulator.  The external portion is removable and is powered by batteries, much like traditional hearing aids (HAs). The implanted portion includes a receiver-stimulator,  which converts information from the transmitter into electric impulses, and an electrode system. The electrode system, which is threaded through the cochlea, transports the electrical impulses to the auditory nerve. The external and internal systems are held next to each other by an implanted magnet that works through the person\u2019s skin(1,2,3)"
        ],
        "indications": [
            "Adults who are permanently profoundly deaf, have a significant hearing loss, or have another type of severe hearing disorder are candidates for a CI.(1,3,4) This might include adults with sensorineural hearing loss, auditory neuropathy, otosclerosis, or inner ear malformations.(3) Although pure-tone  averages established through audiometric testing indicate a person\u2019s hearing sensitivity at different frequencies, hearing sensitivity levels are not considered in isolation when determining who is or is not a candidate for a CI. More important factors include the person\u2019s previous success with another type of amplification (e.g., HAs) and whether or not a CI would provide greater benefits than the person\u2019s current amplification.(5) Adults who are postlingually deafened (i.e., lose their hearing later in life, after learning spoken language) generally are considered good CI candidates; however, with improvements in CI technology, prelingually deafened adults are also having favorable outcomes following implantation.(1,6) Individuals with a CI who use a HA in the contralateral ear but are not experiencing benefits of the HA should consider implantation of a second CI(43)",
            "Patients must consider the following risks prior to undergoing surgery for CI: \u2013Risks associated with receiving general anesthesia(2) \u2013Facial nerve could become damaged during surgical implantation(2) \u2013Meningitis could occur (especially in patients with inner ear abnormalities)(2) \u2013Cerebrospinal fluid could leak(2) \u2013Perilymph fluid could leak(2) \u2013Skin wound could become infected(2) \u2013Blood or fluid could collect at the site of surgery(2) \u2013Vestibular impairments (e.g., dizziness, vertigo), while rare, could develop(2,48,52) \u2013Tinnitus (ringing in the ears)(2)  \u2013Taste sensation could be disturbed(2) \u2013The ear could become numb(2) \u2013The body could reject the CI, leading to localized inflammation and a reparative granuloma(2) \u2013Sounds might be perceived differently than prior to surgery(2) \u2013Residual hearing will be lost(2) \u2013Long-term  effects are unknown and uncertain(2) \u2013Hearing abilities following surgery vary from person to person; the patient might be disappointed with the results(2) \u2013Language comprehension following surgery varies from person to person; the patient might be disappointed with the results(2) \u2013The following medical procedures cannot be performed following cochlear implantation:(2) -MRI (an MRI could dislodge the CI or cause the internal magnet to demagnetize) -Neurostimulation -Electrical surgery -Electroconvulsive therapy -Ionic radiation therapy \u2013CI might need to be removed if infection occurs(2) \u2013CI might fail(2) \u2013As CI technology improves, patient might not be able to upgrade to a new CI if new external parts are not compatible with existing internal portion(2) \u2013CI requires batteries to function(2) \u2013There is a risk of damaging the CI (e.g., external portions can be damaged if they become wet)(2) \u2013Patient might need to make lifestyle changes(2) \u2013Skin can become irritated due to placement of external portions(2) \u2013Strange sounds might be heard when in the presence of magnetic fields (e.g., near airport passenger screening machines)(2)",
            "There is a large amount of opposition to CI use from the Deaf community. Some members of this community believe that CI use is not culturally responsive in that it prevents CI users from being complete members of the community, implies that deafness is a disability, and implies that Deaf persons are of lesser worth(37,38)",
            "In a study conducted in Denmark with 269 adults who received 308 CIs total, researchers found that 168 patients (62.5%) experienced at least 1 complication of surgery. Of those who experienced at least 1 complication, 23 patients had at least 1 major complication and 159 experienced at least 1 minor complication. The most common major complications were wound infection, permanent chorda tympani syndrome (unilateral sweating on the chin after eating), and electrode migration/misplacement/accidental removal. The most common minor complications were transient chorda tympani syndrome, vertigo/dizziness, and tinnitus(31)"

There are several factors that the CI team will consider when deciding which ear to implant. One consideration is whether or not both ears have received previous amplification and/or if one ear was more consistently amplified. Ears that have received consistent amplification are associated with better outcomes upon receiving a CI; therefore, if only one ear has received auditory input over time, that might be the preferred side to implant.(4) Another consideration is which ear has better hearing acuity; most often the ear with poorer hearing receives the CI.(5) Increasingly, patients have been shown to benefit from receiving bilateral CIs compared to unilateral CI.(8,9,54) Patients can undergo simultaneous bilateral implantation (in which both CIs are implanted in the same surgery) or sequential bilateral implantation (in which the second CI is implanted in a second surgery at a later date)(53) -In a systematic review and meta-analysis  with 42 unique studies, authors reported that unilateral cochlear implantation in adults with or without the supplementary use of HAs was effective in improving both speech perception and health-related  quality of life. Bilateral cochlear implantation provided added benefit and improved ability in speech perception as well as increased quality of life(33) -In a systematic review of English-language  studies published between October 2006 and March 2011, authors found that it was not possible to pool the data because of the heterogeneity of the studies. The level of evidence of the included studies was low, but all studies did show a significant benefit to sound localization from bilateral over unilateral CIs. Bilateral CIs were found to be beneficial for speech perception in noise, but there was no added benefit in quiet environments(36) -In a study conducted in Australia, researchers found that 9 adolescents and young adults benefitted from a second, sequentially implanted CI as evidenced by subjective reports and improved scores on listening tests(10) \u2013Even after the implantation of a CI, patients can benefit from simultaneous use of a hearing aid, FM system, or digital adaptive wireless radio transmission system to improve speech perception, especially in the presence of background noise(11,12,27) \u2013Document if patient wears glasses or uses any other type of assistive or adaptive deviceAudiological testing must be completed by a certified and licensed audiologist. The SLP should review the results of the patient\u2019s audiological testing prior to completion of speech-language  evaluationA patient\u2019s ability to hear calibrated pure tones is measured(13)Open-set spoken word recognition tests are frequently used to determine whether or not a patient is an appropriate CI candidate. In an open-set  spoken word recognition test, a patient is asked to identify a spoken word; there are no parameters for which words might be presented. If a patient is unable to display any word recognition on an open-set  spoken word recognition test, a less difficult closed-set  word recognition test might be administered. Closed-set  word recognition tests provide the patient with a list of words that might be presented. If preoperatively a patient receives an open-set  spoken word recognition score that is below the average score received by persons with CIs, the patient is considered a good CI candidate. At a minimum, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head  and Neck Surgery recommends that one monosyllabic word test and one sentence test be used to determine CI candidacy(4) -Consonant-Nucleus-Consonant  (CNC) words(46) -AzBio Sentence Test in Quiet (AzBioQ)(46) -Hearing in Noise Test (HINT)(46) Does the patient currently use HAs or another form of amplification? How has the patient benefited from his or her current amplification?(4)If the patient has not previously used amplification, a 3- to 6-month  trial period might be recommended(4)As part of an aural rehabilitation program for adults with hearing loss, it is important to assess the ways in which the hearing loss is affecting various areas of his or her life. How does the hearing loss affect the patient socially, emotionally, occupationally, and/or educationally? How does the hearing loss affect the patient\u2019s functional communication skills?(4) Measures that can be used to assess the impact of hearing loss on a patient and his or her quality(15) A questionnaire containing 25 items focusing on two areas hearing loss on the social adjustment and the emotional adjustment of the elderly(16) A questionnaire for use by persons under the age of 65 that contains 25 itemssocial handicap and emotional handicap. Also addresses vocational issues confronted by adults with hearing loss(17) A 12-item  scale that can be used to assess the social and emotional impact of hearing loss. A 5-point  scale is used (almost always, often, sometimes, rarely, never). A more significant handicap is indicated by a higher scoreComplete an oral motor assessment in order to rule out or identify any oral mechanism dysfunctionA patient who receives a CI is not able to hear immediately following surgery. Three to 5 weeks after surgery (when the physical healing has taken place), the patient receives the external components of the CI. At that time, the external processor is programmed by the patient\u2019s audiologist. Programming might require several visits to complete, and reprogramming is sometimes necessary if the patient experiences changes in his or her ability to hear over time. Electrodes are assigned specific sound frequencies. During programming, each electrode is programmed for a threshold level (the lowest level at which the patient responds to a sound sensation 100% of the time) and for the most comfortable level of loudness. Other parameters that can be adjusted during programming include global loudness levels and speed of transmission.(4) The CI will be programmed differently for each person to maximize speech perception depending on the individual patient\u2019s residual hearing abilities and audiogram thresholds and whether or not the person has one or two CIs or a CI and an HA(47) \u2013The technology available in CI processors is constantly improving; current models significantly decrease background noise interference, thereby improving speech perception(18)",

            "Authors of a review of literature on cochlear implantation in older adults (age 65+) found that there is a growing body of evidence that supports the use of CIs versus traditional HAs in older adults with poor speech recognition ability.(20) The authors of this review found that the cumulative or psychosocial effects of a person\u2019s hearing loss, not his or her age, should guide clinical decision making with respect to cochlear implantation. In addition, the authors of this review noted that following implantation, older adults did make improvements; however, they tended to make slower gains in speech perception and had lower scores on quality of life measurements than younger adults(20)",
            "In a multicenter clinical trial conducted in the United States between February 2010 and June 2012 that included 38 adults with CI who were postlingually deafened, researchers reported significant improvements in both speech perception in quiet and noisy environments and quality of life 6 and 12 months after initial activation of the implants(46)",
            "In a retrospective study conducted in Germany with a cohort of postlingually deafened adults(280 men and 358 women) who received CIs between July 1984 and September 2008, researchers found that men performed slightly better than women in speech recognition tests, especially in complex listening situations, such as those with background noise(21)",
            "In a study conducted in the United States with two groups of CI recipients, researchers found differences in outcomes according to the age of the recipients. Participants in the study were divided a priori into older (60 years+) and younger (< 60 years) groups, with 20 participants in each of the two groups. The average length of deafness for the older group was 11.1 years and for the younger group it was 11.3 years; average length of implant use was 3.5 years for the older group and 4.4 years for the younger group. Researchers assessed speech recognition in quiet and noise, music perception, and health-related  quality of life for both groups. Speech recognition in both quiet and noise was significantly lower for the older group when compared to the younger group. Both groups had a significant drop in speech recognition in the noisy condition compared to the quiet condition. In general, music recognition was better for the younger group; however, the only significant difference in perception was with respect to timbre recognition (a complex musical concept that involves recognizing tone and quality of a musical note). In 3 of the 6 subdomains (advanced sound processing, self-esteem, and activity limitations) of health-related  quality of life there was no difference between the older and younger groups with respect to perceived benefit of the CI. In the subdomains of basic sound processing, speech production, and social interaction there were differences that approached significance, with the younger group exhibiting higher scores(45)",
            "In a study involving 13 postlingually deafened adults with CIs ranging in age from 21 to 77 years, researchers in the United States examined the relationship between speech perception and music perception. The researchers found that CI users experience a limited quality and quantity of acoustic information that negatively affects their ability to process music. Results of this study further were 1) at least one third of the subjects found music to be unpleasant, 2) close to 50% of subjects perceived music to sound \u201cunnatural,\u201d 3) less than 50% of the subjects listened to music often, and 4) enjoyment of music was unrelated to the ability to perceive music(39)",
            "Twenty-one  adults with unilateral CIs participated in a study conducted in Denmark that investigated the ability of CI users to perceive differences in prosody that provide a semantic contrast. The authors examined this ability in both quiet and noisy listening environments. Following conclusion of the study, the authors reported that study participants could not distinguish between prosodic differences that marked vowel length, word stress, compound words, or phrase minimal pairs as well as members of a control group with normal hearing (n = 10). Additionally, the ability to make these distinctions decreased in the presence of noise and with age (age range of study participants was 40-82  years). The authors concluded that CI users continue to have difficulty perceiving prosodic distinctions that affect speech comprehension in natural situations and that when considering CI candidacy older adults should be made aware of additional difficulties they might experience following implantation(41) ",
            "In a study conducted in the United States, researchers compared the rate of progress between first ears receiving CIs and second ears (in the same individual) receiving a CI. Subjects included 21 adults who began the study with a single CI but had bilateral sequential CIs at the end of the study. This longitudinal study included testing prior to implantation of the second CI and after 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of bilateral implant use. According to the authors of this study, bilateral performance was better than unilateral performance in sentence recognition in quiet, in sentence recognition in noise at a fixed signal-to-noise  ratio (SNR), and in sentence recognition during varied SNR. Additionally, within 3-6 months of implantation of the second ear, second ear outcomes should be similar to first ear. The authors also found that length of deafness significantly affects outcome performance so that a shorter time between the implantation of the first and second CI is optimal(43)",
            "There is some evidence of cortical reorganization after cochlear implantation. Authors of a review of literature on cortical reorganization in cochlear implant recipients reported that there is some evidence of cortical reorganization in the auditory and visual cortex after cochlear implantation; however, due to limitations in the ability to measure brain activity in patients with cochlear implants (i.e., inability to perform MRI/fMRI), the evidence is limited(49)"

        "treatment summary": [
            "Behavioral speech therapy: Three adults participated in a study conducted in the United States that examined the effectiveness of behavioral speech therapy for improving speech production in prelingually deafened adults. Prior to this study, the speech of each subject contained multiple errors despite being implanted for more than 3 years. The Arizona Articulation Proficiency Scale, Third Revision and the collection of at least 50 utterances per subject were used to test speech sound production before and after speech therapy. Results revealed that all 3 subjects\u2019 production of target sounds improved following treatment. These improvements indicate that implantation alone is not enough to maximize communication and speech production(42)",
            "Focus of aural rehabilitation (AR) for adults with a CI:  Following the placement of a CI, AR might focus on: \u2013improving the patient\u2019s ability to interpret auditory information he or she is receiving through the implant(22) \u2013improving the patient\u2019s ability to recognize individual speech sounds through the auditory channel(22) \u2013improving the patient\u2019s ability to discriminate and identify individual words(22) \u2013improving the patient\u2019s conversational skills(22) \u2013improving the patient\u2019s speech, telephone skills, and ability to recognize music(22) \u2013improving the patient\u2019s self-advocacy  skills(22)",
            "Research support for auditory training following a CI: \u2013Authors of a published review of the literature examining the effectiveness of auditory training following the implantation of a CI in adult patients found that not only did auditory training improve performance of specific, targeted goals, but improvements often generalized to other auditory tasks. For example, training a patient to identify phonetic contrasts led to improvements in the patient\u2019s ability to recognize sentences they heard. In follow-up  testing completed 1-2 months after treatment, patients continued to show improvements(19) \u2013In a pilot study conducted in the United States with 14 postlingually deafened adults with CIs, researchers investigated the effectiveness of an auditory training program in which the members of the experimental group were trained in phoneme identification by listening to multiple speakers. The experimental group consisted of 9 subjects and the remaining 5 subjects served as a pseudocontrol group (this group was highly heterogenous and did not undergo any specific auditory training). In this study, phonemic discrimination between the trained contrasting sounds (/ba/-/da/  and /wa/-/ja/) significantly improved in the experimental group only; however, researchers cautioned against drawing firm conclusions due to the heterogeneity of the group and small study size(51)",
            "Computer-Assisted  Speech Training (CAST)  (23) \u2013CAST is a computer program that allows individuals with CIs to engage in auditory rehabilitation using their home computer. CAST targets the specific needs of individuals with CIs in a cost-effective  manner. Progress can be monitored and shared with the individual\u2019s SLP and/or other professionals \u2013Authors of a published review of the literature reveal that CAST has been shown to improve recognition of phonemes, melodic sequences, and Chinese tones. Improved performance continued to be evidenced 1-2 months after training was completed(23)  \u2013In a study conducted in the United Kingdom involving 11 postlingually deafened adults who had used CIs for at least 3 years, researchers found that after 3 weeks of CAST (1 hour, 5 days per week) there was a significant improvement in consonant discrimination(24)",
            "Computerized speech-in-noise  training : In a study conducted in the United States with 5 postlingually deafened adult CI recipients, researchers found that a short-term  computerized speech-in-noise  training program resulted in significantly improved perception of speech in noisy conditions.(35) Training consisted of four 1-hour sessions over the course of 4 days. Researchers noted that in addition to the small sample size, their study group was very heterogeneous; although the results are promising, the results need to be replicated in a much larger and more controlled study(35)",
            "Visual memory training : In a study conducted in the United States with 10 postlingually deafened adults with 6 months\u2019 or more experience using a CI(s), researchers found that visual memory training improved visual memory scores but not auditory perception skills. Study subjects completed a 10-hour  training program at home on a computer that targeted visual digit span (VDS) memory; after the training was complete, follow-up  measures were completed in the laboratory and indicated significant improvement in VDS tasks but not in auditory digit span or Hearing in Noise Test (HINT) sentence recognition in noise, digit recognition in noise, or phoneme recognition in quiet(30)",
            "Use of a neck-loop  FM receiver with CIs: Four adolescents and 10 adults with unilateral or bilateral CIs (with Freedom sound processors) participated in a study conducted in the United States. The authors of this study examined the effects of using electromagnetically coupled frequency modulation (FM) neck-loop  receivers in listening situations that typically are difficult for CI users (e.g., noisy environments).Subjects completed a scale used to measure their auditory performance in different situations (e.g. home, work/school, social) before and after a 4- to 6-week  trial of FM use. Subjects were asked to use the FM systems for a minimum of 1-2 hours per day and to record their experiences in a journal. Following the study, the authors reported that coupling an FM receiver to the Freedom sound processor component of a CI results in 1) speech recognition in noise that is significantly improved; 2) reports by subjects of significantly improved listening in situations with noise, reverberation, and distance from the speaker; and 3) high satisfaction ratings regarding the use of the FM system. The FM systems were judged to be most useful in noisy situations at home, school, or work and during social communication at locations such as restaurants, theaters, religious services, and parties(40) .
