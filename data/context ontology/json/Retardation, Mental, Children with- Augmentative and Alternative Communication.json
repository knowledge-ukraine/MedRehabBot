            "Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) is a communication system that supplements or replaces verbal communication (speech) and includes four main components: symbols, aids, strategies, and techniques(1) \u2013Symbols can include objects, drawings, photographs, or print (e.g., words, letters, sentences)(1) \u2013Aids can be relatively simple or complex devices (e.g., communication boards, electronic devices) for transmitting or receiving messages(1) \u2013Strategies refer to the methods by which symbols can be conveyed in the easiest and most efficient manner(1) \u2013Techniques refer to the ways in which the messages are selected for transmission (e.g., direct selection, scanning)(1)",
            "ID can be caused by injury, disease, or a brain abnormality \u2013Prenatal causes of ID include:(4) -Genetic conditions (e.g., Down syndrome, fragile X syndrome)(4) -Inborn errors of metabolism (e.g., phenylketonuria [PKU] \u2013 can lead to ID if not treated)(4) -Brain malformations(4) -Maternal disease(4) -Environmental influences (e.g., alcohol, drugs, toxins, teratogens)(4) \u2013Perinatal causes of ID include:(4) -Labor and delivery events that lead to neonatal encephalopathy(4) -Low birth weight(58) \u2013Postnatal causes include:(4) -Hypoxic ischemic injury(4) -Traumatic brain injury (TBI)(4)  -Infections(4) -Demyelinating disorders(4) -Seizure disorders(4) -Poverty and cultural deprivation(4,58) -Toxic metabolic syndromes and intoxications (e.g., lead, mercury)(4) \u2013Researchers in the United States studied prenatal and perinatal risk factors associated with ID in a large cohort of 8-year-old  children in Utah (N = 26,108) using information from birth records.(58) Risk factors that were identified were poly/oligohydramnios (too much or too little amniotic fluid), advanced paternal/maternal age, prematurity, fetal distress, premature rupture of membranes, primary/repeat cesarean sections, low birth weight, assisted ventilation greater than 20 minutes, small-for-gestational age, low Apgar scores, and congenital infections. Socioeconomic disadvantage maintained a prominent association with increased ID risk when underlying genetic disorders were excluded \u2013In approximately half of patients with ID, the cause is unknown(2) \u2013For detailed information on communication disorders in children with ID, see Clinical Review\u2026Communication Disorders: School-Aged  Children with Intellectual Disability ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T709139",
            "The terms global developmental delay and developmental delay are often used instead of ID to describe children under the age of 5 years but have also been used to describe children over the age of 5 years(3) \u2013Global developmental delay refers to a significant delay (two or more standard deviations) across at least two or more developmental domains(3)",
            "For individuals who are school-aged  and older, the term intellectual disability is now preferred over the term mental retardation by the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (AAIDD). The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5 ) diagnostic criteria for ID are as follows: \u2013Significantly below average intellectual functioning confirmed by clinical assessment and individualized, standardized intelligence testing(4) \u2013Deficits or impairments in adaptive functioning. Adaptive deficits negatively affect functioning in one more ADLs (e.g., communication, social participation, independent living) across multiple environments(4) \u2013Deficits in intellectual and adaptive functioning are evident during the \u201cdevelopmental period\u201d(4)",
            "The DSM-5  specifies degrees of severity of ID (mild, moderate, severe, profound) based on adaptive functioning, not based on IQ, because adaptive functioning determines how much support is needed.(4) According to the DSM-5 , adaptive functioning should be assessed with both clinical evaluation as well as individualized, culturally appropriate, psychometrically sound assessments(4)",
            "The AAIDD also classifies severity in terms of support needed for adaptive skills areas (intermittent, limited, extensive, or pervasive support needed)(5)",
            "Prevalence of ID in the United States is approximately 1%(5)",
            "The symptoms of a communication disorder in children with ID vary considerably between children and are influenced by the child\u2019s age, the severity of accompanying motor or cognitive impairments, the child\u2019s medical status, the child\u2019s home environment, and/or the presence or absence of hearing and/or vision loss.(6,54) Children with ID can exhibit problems in the areas of producing vocalizations and/or speech, receptive language, expressive language (including the use of gesture), and/or social language (pragmatics)(6)",

A copy of the scale and instructions can be retrieved at dart-gbg.org/public/anpassningar/RAACS%20Version%203_130108.doc -Researchers in Sweden developed the RAACS scale to assess the communicative style of parents as they engaged in play interactions (videotaped) with their children using AAC. The researchers found that the scale showed acceptable inter-  and intra-coder  reliability and excellent internal consistency. Used pre- and postintervention, the measure  indicated changes in the communication behavior of a treatment group but not in the control group. Treatment focused on improving the responsiveness of parent communication and the modeling of AAC use by parentsMany standardized language tests include separate standardized scores for children with mild ID. However, a review of standardized tests found that many do not include a large normative sample and that most do not measure a student\u2019s pragmatic communication.(22) No tests included students with more severe ID in the normative sample.(22) Children with ID often have impairment of receptive and expressive language skills; for some children, receptive language skills will be more impaired than expressive language skills, whereas in others expressive is more impaired relative to receptive.(46) SLPs should always supplement standardized tests with informal language assessment procedures to assess students\u2019 pragmatic, social, and functional communication abilities.

            "aac assessment": "The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) recommends that AAC assessment adhere to the participation model, which is based on the fact that all persons with disabilities can enhance communication ability.(1,16) The goal of an AAC assessment within the participation model is to match the child with optimal communication strategies and systems so that he or she can participate in meaningful events in daily life.(1) Assessment must consider the skills of the child as well as the setting and prospective conversational partners. A team approach is recommended in the implementation of AAC; team members typically include SLPs, teachers, the AAC user, and parents/ caregivers. To the greatest extent possible, assessment procedures should be applicable to everyday life(1,7)The purpose of an environmental assessment is to determine the extent of the child\u2019s communication repertoire and social functions with respect to the child\u2019s peers.(16) The following -A peer can be observed in a particular setting (e.g., classroom)(16) -The communication abilities of the child being considered for AAC are compared to those of his or her peers (e.g., asking questions, answering yes/no questions, greeting others, requesting objects or activities)(16) -The child is then provided the AAC support and taught the skills necessary to participate in the activity(16) -Positioning and location for each activity should be considered when selecting an AAC system(18) -Communication functions and specific messages (e.g., sharing information with classmates, asking for assistance) should be considered when selecting and programming an AAC device(18)A child\u2019s knowledge of symbols is typically assessed through dynamic assessment, in which the symbols are taught to the child and then assessed. Symbols include gestures, line drawings, photographs, pictures, traditional orthography, and manual signs. Before assessment, a range of concepts that are functional and meaningful for the child are selected to be tested. Language tasks that can be used to test symbol(16,18)The evaluator says, \u201cShow me\u2026\u201d while presenting multiple symbols in front of the childThe evaluator asks, \u201cIs this a\u2026?\u201d while presenting a symbolThe child is asked to match a symbol to its referent The child is asked to answer questions using symbols that are availableThe child is given an opportunity to request an item by using a symbolThe organization of symbols in an aided system should reflect how the child organizes the symbols rather than how the SLP may organize them. Symbols can be arranged taxonomically, alphabetically, schematically, or idiosyncratically (e.g., the child puts \u201cbaseball\u201d with \u201cdad\u201d because he plays baseball(18)The child groups individual vocabulary on different pages or in different boxesThe child is required to match words togetherThe child may trial one organizational system and changes may be made based on the child\u2019s speed, accuracy, and preference in selecting itemsInterviews with the child\u2019s caregivers, teachers, and other communicative partners might identify possible communication barriers that can be resolved. In addition, systematic observation of the child\u2019s interactions, with focus on the communicative partners, can yield information on barriers that may limit the child\u2019s opportunity to communicate. Sample barriers include lack of sufficient response time allowed for child, lack of child attention during communicative interactions, and environmental barriers such as presence of loud noises in the classroom(16,18)Note any difficulties the child has with motor control that interfere with social interaction and communication.

Many individuals with ID have multiple disabilities(54) \u2013The child has socially unacceptable or harmful ways of communicating (e.g., hitting)(1) \u2013Existing methods of communication are tiring or inefficient for the child(1) \u2013Existing methods of communication are understood only by a limited number of familiar conversational partners(1)",

            "Effective and efficient use of AAC occurs with a coordinated effort on the part of teachers, the SLP, the family, and the AAC user(7,29)",
            "When implementing intervention, the SLP/teacher should consider the child\u2019s preferences and functional motivations(30)",
            "Rather than a single system of communication, the assessment team should identify multiple methods of communication that the child can use in different situations.(29) Some forms of AAC (e.g., manual signs) are more easily accessed but understood by only some communication partners; voice output communication aids (VOCAs) are more widely understood but may not be available at the moment that the child wants to communicate",
            "Monitoring of the device or system should be ongoing due to the changing needs of the child and the level of required external support(7,29)",
            "Treatment should be functional and family-centered  and/or school-centered  when possible. The child should be taught to use the AAC system functionally in diverse settings with different partners.(1) The SLP might be involved in providing direct coaching to parents and siblings regarding the use of the AAC device. Families should always have the opportunity to provide information on the children\u2019s greatest communication needs(29)",
            "The SLP will typically be involved in instructing teachers, paraeducators, and parents on how to use the AAC system with the child. Instruction will vary with the individual\u2019s knowledge but might include providing information on the importance of communication, the relationship between behavior and communication, prompting students to use AAC, and how to respond to the student\u2019s communicative attempts(31) ",
            "Modeling of the use of the device/system is an essential part of the instructional process. The teacher/SLP/caregiver models using the AAC system and integrates the system into his or her own communication during naturalistic and motivating situations. Modeling allows input experience for the child(32) \u2013Enhanced milieu teaching (EMT): Features of EMT include: a) following the child\u2019s attentional lead and establishing joint attention; b) using teaching episodes that are brief, positive, rewarding, and embedded within natural activities that occur throughout the child\u2019s day; c) simultaneous teaching of form (syntax), content (vocabulary), and function (pragmatics); d) targeting general communication forms and functions that are on the boundary of the child\u2019s productive communicative competence; and e) using mands (adult questions, commands, or directives)and models to elicit production of targets that are related to the child\u2019s focus of attention.(51) The principles of EMT can be used as a means of modeling AAC",
            "V ocabulary/symbol considerations \u2013Target vocabulary used with the AAC system should be salient to the child and modeled in naturalistic, routine, and motivating situations(32) \u2013It is important to include symbols to allow the child to communicate basic needs (e.g., food, drink, pain, toilet) but not to limit communication to basic needs and to also include symbols that assist the child in fostering social relationships(32) \u2013When introducing new symbols, routine situations should be used so that the child\u2019s attention can be focused on learning the new word rather than understanding a novel situation(32) \u2013When choosing vocabulary to use with AAC, it is important to include people\u2019s names to encourage social closeness(32) \u2013Emotion labels are important for the child to talk about school and other past events. They also allow the child to communicate when he or she is frustrated(32) \u2013Inclusion of action words will help foster more complex syntactic development or symbol combinations(31)",
            "Access considerations \u2013There are two ways of indicating symbols with aided AAC systems, direct selection and scanning. Direct selection involves the child directly selecting the symbol (e.g., using a finger, using eye gaze). For those who have difficulty with motor control, scanning may be used(32) \u2013There are two kinds of scanning: electronic and partner-assisted: -In electronic scanning, the AAC device presents the choices electronically. For example, a light may go on next to each symbol one-by-one.  When a light indicates the desired symbol, the child selects it by hitting a switch.(32) Some devices allow for either direct selection or scanning -In partner-assisted  scanning, the communication partner scans through symbols one-by-one  (i.e., by pointing). When the partner arrives at the desired choice, the child indicates by vocalizing, moving an arm, or eye-blink(32)",
            "Display presentation considerations: Presentation refers to the organization and layout of the concepts within a display. Variables in presentation include the permanence of the display (i.e., static vs. dynamic display), layout of the display (i.e., grid or visual scene displays), number of representations on the display, size of the symbols, and color organization(33) \u2013In a static display, all symbols can be viewed simultaneously but are limited in number. In a dynamic display, the person can navigate different electronic or nonelectronic pages to find other symbols(33) \u2013Symbols can be displayed on a grid (rows and columns of pictures) or as a visual scene display. A visual scene display contains a drawing or photograph with hot spots that allow the user to select items within the scene. For example, a scene may be a kitchen and the user can select an item of food. It is theorized that visual scene displays might reduce cognitive demands in finding and using correct symbols because the symbols are displayed in a contextually meaningful context(33) \u2013Recent AAC applications developed for use on mainstream devices (mobile phones with texting, iPads, iPod Touch) have made AAC more affordable and more available, and have also given the users an opportunity to \u201cblend in.\u201d(52,53) There is some evidence that AAC users have a preference for an iPad-based  speech-generating  device over the traditional Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS).(17) For example, in a study in Sweden, researchers found that texting with picture symbols and speech increased independence and participation in communication exchanges in adults with complex communication needs and ID.(53) However, researchers caution that only minimal research has focused on improving the design and display of AAC technologies to maximize outcomes for children. Most of the available mobile technology apps have replicated traditional AAC interfaces that were developed in the early years of AAC and most are not based on research evidence. There is a need to develop new generation AAC systems that are responsive to the needs of children who use them(52) ",
            "AAC should be used with evidence-based  instructional procedures such as naturalistic teaching strategies.(32) For detailed information on assessment and treatment of communication disorders associated with developmental and intellectual disabilities, please see the series of Clinical Reviews on this topic",
            "Types of AAC:  AAC is typically categorized into unaided systems of communication and aided systems of communication \u2013Unaided communication:  Unaided approaches to AAC involve using the child\u2019s body to communicate by means of manual signs, gestures, vocalizations, facial expressions, or body movements(34) -Sign language/manual signs: Manual signs may be a primary method of communication or part of a multimodal method of communicating. Even children who may usually use an aided method of communicating may need other methods, such as manual signs, when their electronic or nonelectronic aid is absent or malfunctions(36) -Advantages of sign language/gestures include portability, speed of message preparation, and access to an unlimited number of potential messages. Limitations include the requirement of sufficient fine motor skills to produce the signs; in addition, the signs/gestures need to be recognizable to the communication partner(37) -Use of manual signs is more effective when staff (e.g., teachers, aides, therapists) utilize the signs throughout the day across a variety of activities.(62) Simultaneous use of speech and signs has been shown to increase mean length of utterance in children with ID(63) \u2013Aided communication: Aided communication approaches include light-technology  devices and high-tech devices -Light-technology  (low-tech)  systems:Light-technology AAC refers to nonelectronic external systems such as alphabet boards, symbol-based  topic boards, dry-erase  boards, and programs such as the PECS (see below for description)(37) -In all cases, patients who use AAC for communication should have a light-tech  component to their AAC system.(60) Because batteries and computers fail, no patient should only be trained in the use of an electronic device to communicate.(60) In addition to technology failures, the clinician must consider that one AAC device or method cannot meet all of a patient\u2019s communication needs for all possible situations and speakers; hence, a low-tech  option (or multiple low-tech  options) should always be provided.(60) There is no one low-tech  option that works best for all patients; it is important to trial several different speech supplementation methods to determine which type increases functional communication the most(61) -Advantages of methods such as drawing and a dry-erase board over fixed communication systems such as a communication board are that they can be used in dynamic situations, allowing for expansion and modification of messages(37) -Because light-technology  systems do not have speech output, they require the active participation of the communication partner in interpreting and speaking the words that the child selects; thus, conversations can be highly interactive(37) -Light-technology  systems also allow frequent opportunities for the communication partner to model when he or she supplements spoken output by pointing to the corresponding symbol(37) -The success of the interaction depends on the communication partner\u2019s knowledge of the topic, knowledge of the AAC system, and comfort in interacting with the system; thus, it is crucial that communication partners are trained in the use of the particular system with the child(37) -The most intervention research on light-technology systems for children with ID has been with PECS -PECS is a program that teaches the child to request and comment by giving picture cards to a communication partner.(38) The communication partner responds by modeling the verbal request and providing the requested item. The child is taught to use PECS by a series of shaping and prompting procedures. Single cards can be used, or cards can be combined into a sequence on a sentence strip and exchanged with the communication partner.(38) For detailed information on the strategies and the sequence of instructional steps for PECS, see Frost & Bondy, 1996(39) -In a multiple baseline study conducted in the United States across behaviors, PECS with peers was used to increase social interactions (greetings, requests, and responses) for two children (ages 6 years and 14 years) with severe developmental disabilities.(40) The peers were trained in how to respond to the child by taking the PECS icon and giving the requested item. Social interactions took place during group activities such as coloring, puzzles, and art projects. Results indicated that the two children both demonstrated a modest increase in social behaviors by using PECS as well as other forms of communication, such as spoken language and American Sign Language. The authors noted that the participants preferred the use of other forms of communication in combination with or as an alternative to PECS but that PECS provided a place to start when interacting with peers(40)  -In a multiple baseline study conducted in the United States, researchers provided preliminary evidence that a 9-year-old  boy with multiple disabilities, including severe ID and deaf-blindness,  could learn to use contextually referenced words (more, new, done) in a modified PECS procedure with tactile symbols.(57) The subject in this study was able to use conceptually referenced symbols to communicate about 12 different stimuli \u2013High-technology  systems: High-technology  systems are electronic devices such as speech-generating  devices. Speech-generating  devices have been classified into two main types: devices that allow for formation of new messages and devices that use word or whole-phrase  retrieval of prerecorded messages. Caregivers and patients should be involved in selecting the device. Factors to consider when selecting a device include: -Appearance: The assessment team and patient should consider the size, type of pictures (symbolic, photographs), and hardware required. For example, a person who is mobile might want a smaller device for portability, whereas a person who is in a wheelchair may want a larger display for ease of use -Symbols should be culturally and individually relevant (e.g., if the patient participates in religious activities, options to allow for communication in these situations should be included) -Accessibility and ease of use: Many patients have paralysis or hemiparesis and portability should be considered. Can the patient use the device while holding it at the same time? Can the patient carry the device? -V oice quality: Is the voice quality clear? Does the patient have any difficulty perceiving the voice? -Effectiveness: Does the device meet the person\u2019s communication needs? -Dynamic screen technology or static display? -Language demands: How are messages composed? Letters, single words, text plus symbols, phrases, sentences, visual scenes .
