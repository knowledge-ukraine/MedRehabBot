For the study, 3 groups of children (11 PWS, 12 lean, 12 obese) with mean ages 10.9, 9.2, and 9.2, respectively, completed ten 2-minute  bouts of cycling exercise, with blood sampling completed pre-exercise,  immediately post-exercise,  and at 15, 30, and 60 minutes after completion. These samples were analyzed for levels of both metabolites and hormones(13) \u2013Utilizing a supervised home exercise program has been shown to effectively improve physical activity in women with PWS(21) -Based on a study conducted in France involving 10 women with PWS -Patients participated in an hour of exercise training twice weekly for 16 weeks -Exercise sessions consisted of 10 minutes of light warm-up  endurance activities, 15 minutes of strength training exercises, and 30 minutes of moderate-intensity  endurance exercises. Activities consisted of Nordic walking, running, step/stair climbing, ball sport games (e.g., football, basketball, volleyball) -Results show that women with PWS had an improvement in walking endurance and were more willing to participate in moderate-to-vigorous  physical activities after starting the program.No changes were found in general body composition .
