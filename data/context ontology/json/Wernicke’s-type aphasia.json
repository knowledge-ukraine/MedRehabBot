            "Aphasia is a disorder that results from damage to the parts of the brain that control language abilities.(2) Aphasia can impair any or all of the following: speaking, listening, reading, and writing.(2) Wernicke\u2019s aphasia is a primary, or central, aphasia that affects the lexical (i.e., related to words and word choice) and semantic (i.e., related to the meanings of words) aspects of language.(3) It is hypothesized that patients with Wernicke\u2019s aphasia might not be able to fully discriminate the acoustic information contained within speech; this results in impaired auditory comprehension.(3,4) Although patients with Wernicke\u2019s aphasia have significantly impaired word and phoneme selection, the syntax of language often is preserved and sometimes even overused (paragrammatism)(3)",

Patients with Wernicke\u2019s aphasia also have difficulty with naming (anomia) and with repetition of words, phrases, and sentences.(1) Additionally, these patients often are unaware of their communication difficulties. Accompanying impairments can include mood disorders (e.g., anxiety/depression, agitation), short-term  memory deficits, hemisensory deficits, swallowing difficulties (dysphagia), apraxia of speech, and dysarthria(1,5)",

            "It is unclear if the type of aphasia influences prognosis for language recovery \u2013Authors of an RCT conducted in Sweden with 118 individuals with aphasia following stroke found that a greater percentage of the patients with Wernicke\u2019s aphasia (78%) exhibited significant improvement in language abilities following intensive speech-language  therapy during the first 3 weeks after the initial stroke as compared to those patients with Broca\u2019s aphasia. Additionally, smaller infarct size was associated with better recovery of language abilities in the first 6 months after stroke(67) \u2013In a prospective, longitudinal study conducted in the United Kingdom with 75 patients, researchers compared the relative outcomes of patients with different types of aphasia and found that patients with Wernicke\u2019s aphasia improved less on the WAB during the first year of recovery than those with Broca\u2019s aphasia(31)",

In this study, there were two groups of patients, experimental (who received the very early aphasia rehabilitation as soon as possible after a stroke, mean of 6.1 days poststroke) and a historical control group from a previous study. There were patients in this study in both groups with mild to severe aphasia of varying types. At the conclusion of the study, the researchers controlled the data for initial aphasia and stroke disability and found that participants who underwent the very early aphasia rehabilitation achieved 18% greater recovery on the Aphasia Quotient (AQ) and 1.5% higher scores on the Discourse Analysis (DA) than those in the historical control cohort. At 6 months postintervention, the experimental participants maintained a 16% higher score on the AQ and a 0.6% (not statistically significant) higher score on the DA over the control group(56) \u2013In a pilot study conducted in Italy with 12 patients who had mild-moderate aphasia poststroke, researchers randomly assigned these patients to the experimental group (daily therapy for 2 weeks beginning an average of 2.2 days poststroke) or no therapy. The patients in the experimental group performed significantly better than the control group in naming abilities, writing, and reading aloud as measured by the Aachen Aphasia Test (AAT) at the conclusion of the study.

            "Treatment for communication deficits associated with a variety of types of aphasia  \u2013Authors of a systematic review published in 2016 that included RCTs for aphasia therapy up to 2015 found that research indicated significant and clinical improvements in functional language abilities following speech-language  therapy for persons with aphasia following stroke when compared to having no therapy(34) -Authors noted that the results indicated better functional communication outcomes associated with intensive speech-language  therapy (i.e., higher frequency, higher dose, longer period of time) versus less intense speech-language therapy(34) -Significantly more patients withdrew from intensive programs as compared to the less intense programs(34) -There was not enough evidence to support the effectiveness of one speech-language  therapy approach over another(34) \u2013At present, no pharmacological treatment has been shown to be adequately effective for general use for patients with aphasia.(37) Authors of a review of pharmacological treatments for poststroke aphasia advocated more research on the effects of intensive speech-language  therapy in conjunction with pharmacological agents. The following are some pharmacological treatments that have been investigated:(38) -Piracetam: Placebo-controlled  trials have found this drug to be effective in aphasia recovery immediately post stroke but not effective in patients with chronic aphasia(37) -Bromocriptine/dexamphetamine: These drugs act on the catecholamine systems and have shown varying efficacy in case series, open-label  studies, and placebo-controlled  trials. Bromocriptine has been shown to be useful only in patients with nonfluent aphasia who have reduced initiation of output(38) -Donepezil: Donepezil acts on the cholinergic system and has shown promise in patients with chronic poststroke aphasia in single-case  series, case series, and an open-label  study(38) -Another review of 10 pharmacological RCTs involving patients with aphasia concluded that there was weak evidence that piracetam improved language recovery and that researchers should further examine the harmful effects as well as the long-term  effects of pharmacological treatment. The reviewers could not conclude if drug therapy was more effective than speech-language therapy or if one drug was more effective than another(39) \u2013Group therapy: Group therapy typically includes pragmatic objectives such as improving ability to convey a message and initiating conversational exchanges. In addition, group therapy provides support for the individual, information about aphasia, and increases the patient\u2019s confidence in communicative situations -The effects of group therapy on patients with chronic aphasia were investigated in an RCT conducted by researchers in the United States with two groups, immediate treatment and delayed treatment(40) -Group therapy was provided by an SLP for 5 hours/week (2.5-hour periods/2 days a week) for 4 months. The control group participated in social activities (support, performance, movement groups) to control for the effects of social interaction -The first part of group therapy involved discussions of interest for the patients. Information exchange was facilitated by communicative drawing, role-playing,  natural gestures, maps, pictures, personal notebooks, conversational prompting, and scripting. A break for refreshments included family members. The last part of the group session was spent wrapping up the initial discussion or talking about news events -Dependent measures included standardized tests: WAB AQ, CADL, SPICA. Results indicated that the immediate treatment group had significantly higher scores on the measures than the group not receiving treatment. Within-group performance revealed significant increases after 2 months of treatment and after 4 months of treatment. No significant declines were noted at 1 month post treatment(40) \u2013Supported conversation: In a single-blind  RCT conducted in Canada, researchers investigated the effects of training of volunteers (N = 40 volunteers, 40 patients) on the conversational interaction of patients with aphasia(41) -Training included a 1-day  workshop and 1.5 hours of hands-on  experience to teach volunteers topics such as keeping talk natural and avoiding being patronizing. They were also taught to support comprehension of the patient and use techniques such as gesture, drawing, pictographic resources, and writing keywords -Measures were researcher-developed  and designed to assess the skill of the conversational partner in \u201cacknowledging and revealing the competence of adults with aphasia.\u201d Another researcher-developed  measure assessed the level of interaction of the patient -Trained volunteers scored higher than untrained volunteers on ratings of acknowledging competence and revealing competence. Patients with aphasia showed change in social and message exchange skills(41)  -Other intervention studies support direct training of family members and other partners to improve communication between both participants(42,43) \u2013Promoting Aphasics\u2019 Communicative Awareness (PACE): PACE has been described as a functional therapy approach that promotes more realistic conversations to assist patients with aphasia to improve their communication skills.(44)Features of PACE include free choice of communicative modality (gesture, speech), equal opportunity for the patient and the therapist to send and receive messages, the use of novel (rather than known) information, and natural feedback used to figure out the sender\u2019s message. The patient and therapist take turns communicating the content represented on a picture card. Picture cards are drawn from a stack so that only the \u201cmessage sender\u201d knows the content (novel information). The turn ends when the message is conveyed successfully. The clinician\u2019s role is to model effective communicative behaviors that are within the patient\u2019s capabilities and to give the patient opportunities for successful communication. Other conversational partners (spouse) can take part in therapy to learn strategies -Although several treatment studies have examined the efficacy of PACE, the evidence is mixed due to methodological reasons (e.g., use of a modified version of PACE, comparison with an unequal type of treatment, lack of control of other factors influencing recovery). See references below for further review of PACE treatment procedures and efficacy studies(44,45) \u2013Bilingual patients with aphasia: For bilingual patients with aphasia, there is preliminary evidence that treatment in the nondominant language might better facilitate cross-linguistic  generalization than treatment in the dominant language(15) -For detailed information on assessment and treatment of bilingual adults with aphasia, see Clinical Review\u2026Language Disorders: Aphasia in Bilingual Adults ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T708880",
            "Specific treatment for patients with Wernicke\u2019s aphasia: A commonly occurring symptom in patients with Wernicke\u2019s aphasia is a lack of awareness of their speech and semantic errors and the use of jargon.(46) Therapy with patients with Wernicke\u2019s aphasia might focus on increasing the patient\u2019s awareness of his or her jargon and using self-monitoring strategies. No treatment research on the effectiveness of self-monitoring  strategies with patients with Wernicke\u2019s aphasia is currently available \u2013Constraint-Induced  Language Therapy (CILT): based on the principles of Constraint-Induced  Movement Therapy (CIMT) for motor rehabilitation following stroke(47) -Principles of CILT include: -Constraint: not allowing the patient to use compensatory strategies for communication (e.g., drawing, writing, gesturing)(47) -Forced use: forcing the use of speech during communicative exchanges(47) -Massed practice: participating in therapy in high, concentrated doses (such as 2\u20134 hours per day, 4\u20135 days per week)(47) -In a small randomized study conducted in Belgium with 9 patients, researchers compared the effectiveness of CILT (referred to as constraint-induced  aphasia therapy [CIAT]) to BOX (a Dutch drill-based, lexical-semantic  therapy approach) for patients with fluent aphasia. BOX focuses on explanations of written words, sentences, and paragraphs as well as various semantic exercises with the goal of strengthening semantic language networks. Both groups participated in intensive treatment, receiving 30 hours of therapy over the course of 9 or 10 weekdays. At the conclusion of therapy, both groups exhibited significant improvements in language abilities as measured by the Amsterdam Nijmegen Everyday Language Test, the Communicative Effectiveness Index, and the Aachen Aphasia Test. Researchers recommended additional studies with larger study populations to confirm treatment efficacy(36) -Authors of a case study reported neuroplasticity in a patient with chronic Wernicke\u2019s aphasia following intense language therapy including both CILT and PACE(47) -Patient was a 55-year-old,  right-handed  man who was 3 years status post single left hemisphere stroke; MRI revealed large left temporoparietal lesion(47) -Single-participant  multiple baseline design was utilized; researchers took both standardized language measures (including auditory comprehension) and informal measures of the patient\u2019s naming abilities on the same set of pictures pretreatment, post CILT, post PACE, and 6 months post CILT; additionally, a functional MRI overt naming task was administered pre and post treatment(47) -Improved naming and auditory comprehension was seen following both phases of therapy(47)  -With respect to neuroplasticity and the results of the functional MRI (fMRI) post treatment, the patient did not seem to have functional reorganization per se; however, the frontal network of his brain that had been overactive in the pretreatment fMRI study was less intense, with seemingly more efficient use of the neural networks post treatment(47) -For detailed information on CILT, see Clinical Review\u2026Aphasia: Constraint-Induced  Language Therapy ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T902529 \u2013Verb tense/aspect training -The authors of a research study conducted in Germany with 4 German-speaking patients with aphasia (2 with Broca\u2019s and 2 with Wernicke\u2019s) found that a therapy program specifically focused on elicitation of inflected verbs improved verb production in all patients(48) -Treatment consisted of 10 30-minute  sessions conducted over the course of 2 weeks(48) -At the start of each session, patients were asked to put groups of drawings in the correct order (e.g., \u201cThe boy is going to eat the sandwich,\u201d \u201cThe boy is eating the sandwich,\u201d \u201cThe boy ate the sandwich\u201d)(48) -For each picture in the groups, the following four steps were used: -Sentence completion tasks with cues related to each picture; patient was provided with different forms of each verb and asked to select the correct one for a given picture(48) -Grammaticality judgment task; using the verb in the form that the patient selected in the previous step, the clinician read the entire sentence to the patient and asked him or her to judge whether it was correct or not (when it was not correct, the procedure started over at the first step)(48) -Reading aloud; patient was asked to read the complete sentence aloud given cues as needed. Once the patient was able to read the sentence aloud with cues, the cues were removed and the patient was asked to read it aloud independently(48) -Sentence production; with all cues/pictures/words removed, the patient was asked to produce a sentence about the activity in his or her own words(48) -Patients were also given homework exercises to complete with a computer program specifically designed for this study(48) -At the conclusion of the study, 3 of the 4 study participants demonstrated significant improvement in the sentence production tasks with the trained verbs; the fourth participant improved on the tasks and approached statistical significance(48) -Two of the 4 patients (1 with Broca\u2019s and 1 with Wernicke\u2019s) showed significant improvement on untrained verbs as well(48) \u2013Attentive Reading and Constrained Summarization (ARCS) -ARCS is a cognitive-linguistic  discourse therapy in which participants are required to read aloud and verbally summarize a reading passage without using nonspecific language (e.g., \u201cthing\u201d or \u201cstuff\u201d).(62) In the original ARCS protocol, there are 3 steps: -Read two to three sentences out loud with the goal of later summarizing the information(62) -Re-read  the information silently to ensure comprehension(62) -Summarize the information in the passage while maintaining topic and using only meaningful words (no noninformational words [\u201cstuff\u201d], no opinion words, and no pronouns)(62) -In a case study with two participants with chronic moderate and severe Wernicke\u2019s aphasia (females aged 63 and 83), researchers documented improvements in naming and quality of life in one of the two participants (63-year-old  with moderate Wernicke\u2019s aphasia) after 18 sessions of ARCS therapy over the course of 10 weeks(62) \u2013Therapy to decrease perseveration -The authors of a case study investigated the effects of semantic treatment to reduce perseveration in one patient with Wernicke\u2019s aphasia. The patient exhibited fluent but empty speech (devoid of communicative value) and impaired naming ability. When unable to give the correct name for an object, he exhibited perseverations. Treatment focused on improving the semantic system rather than targeting perseverations directly. Results indicated perseveration reduction and eventual disappearance of perseverations(49)  \u2013Therapy for short-term  memory -There is evidence that patients with Wernicke\u2019s aphasia fail to understand because they forget what has been said.(50) Therapy to target short-term  memory may consist of exercises requiring the patient to recall sentences of increasing length.(50,51) Results of case studies suggest that patients can improve short-term  memory, but effects on comprehension ability may be limited.(50,51) Further research is needed -For detailed information on assessment and treatment of memory deficits, see Clinical Review\u2026Memory Impairment: Speech Therapy ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T708911 \u2013Situational therapy with gesture: Situational therapy consists of training the patient to use gesture and other means of nonverbal communication in daily situations (e.g., going to the grocery store) -This therapy is hypothesized to be effective because patients with Wernicke\u2019s aphasia often have better nonverbal communication than verbal communication; however, no case studies have trialed this method of therapy(52) \u2013Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)(53) -Involves constant, low-intensity  current being passed through two electrodes placed on the head. There are two types of stimulation with tDCS: anodal stimulation and cathodal stimulation. Anodal stimulation is used to excite neuronal activity, and cathodal stimulation inhibits or reduces neuronal activity(53) -In a double-blind,  sham-controlled  study conducted in the United States, researchers used anodal tDCS to improve naming reaction time in patents with fluent aphasia(53) -Eight participants with aphasia resulting from stroke (patients ranged from 10 to 150 months poststroke)(53) -All patients received language therapy in combination with either anodal or sham tDCS(53) -Changes in reaction time during naming tasks were measured after anodal tDCS and sham tDCS; significantly better reaction time was found for the anodal tDCS(53) -At this time tDCS is used only in research and is not available for clinical use; however, the promising findings in research studies with both tDCS and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) warrant further research into clinical applicability(53) .
