            "The onset of focal hand dystonia (FHD) usually is idiopathic, progressing in severity over months and often years. Symptoms include involuntary contractions and cramping of the muscles of the digits, hand, and wrist, as well as abnormal posturing. Co-contractions  of opposing muscles often occur. The contractions result in loss of control of the hand and often are present only during performance of a specific task (e.g., playing an instrument, typing, writing). In later stages, the symptoms may progress and become more generalized, occurring with any use of the hand. Typically there is no pain, although muscle aches may occur with prolonged contractions. There is controversy regarding the classification of FHD, but one approach is to classify FHD as simple dystonia, which involves only the hand or impacts a single task; dystonic dystonia, in which abnormal movements impact multiple tasks; or progressive dystonia, which involves more than just the hand (e.g., involves hand and arm). The initial presentation of FHD varies, and may include vague complaints of pain, decreased motor control, fatigue or a sense of weakness, or decreased performance (e.g., decreased sound quality from a musical instrument)(14) Causes, Pathogenesis, & Risk Factors"

            "Three main areas of abnormality have been identified: reduced inhibition of the motor system at cortical, subcortical, andspinal levels; reduced sensory perception and integration; and impaired sensorimotor integration(14)",
            "Abnormal functional brain connectivity(11,14) and disordered or maladaptive plasticity of intracortical neurons in theprimary somatosensory cortex are thought to contribute to the psychophysiology of focal hand dystonia(1,13)",
            "It is hypothesized that a task repeatedly performed by the hand(s), often at a rapid pace, may exceed the body\u2019s neuroplasticability over time, resulting in an inability of the digits to act separately. Therefore, the loss of motor control is dueto overstimulation caused by rapid and repeated input. The thought is that this causes the individual to experiencesomatosensory de-differentiation,  with the normally separate digits being generalized into one receptive area of the braininstead of being processed by the brain as individual units(14)",
            "Extreme task specificity, such that musicians may experience symptoms only while playing specific musical passages andnot others, suggests a defect in organization of motor programs, not simply movements"

            "The risk of FHD increases significantly for individuals who participate in activities requiring repetitive hand movementsfor prolonged periods of time.

Genetics and a history of trauma to the involved hand may also contribute. 1\u20132%of professional musicians develop FHD",
            "Authors of a study designed to assess the presence of interhemispheric inhibition (IHI) in family members without dystoniawithin a cluster of individuals with musician\u2019s dystonia found that reduced IHI may be an endophenotypic marker forFHD(17)"

The patient is then slowly reintroduced to the causative task, attempting to perform the task without any FHD symptomsIt is generally recommended that patients undergoing sensory retraining participate in stimulation activities in a variety of scenarios and in different positions(35) Increased neural tensionNormal neural mobility Manual therapy _ Upper limb neurodynamic test gliding to decrease neural tension, based on evaluation findings. Depending on which nerve (medial, radial, ulnar) is identified as having increased tension, the appropriate gliding sequence and position should be used, gliding only to the point at which discomfort begins, and gradually progressing as symptoms allowProgress each unique patient as appropriate and indicatedRecommend neural glides for home as appropriate  Reduced hand, finger, forearm, and shoulder ROMImprove mobility of the shoulder, wrist, and hand, with correction of muscle imbalancesTherapeutic exercises _ Internal rotation stretches (towel stretch, sleeper stretch), pectoralis stretches (door/corner stretch), and manual stretching may all be utilized to address common areas of tightness. Any other tight musculature should be similarly addressed _ _ Physical agents/ mechanical modalities _ Moist heat pack to increase tissue elasticity prior to manual therapy and stretching exercises _ _ Manual therapy _ Massage and myofascial release may be used to reduce tightness and spasm of the upper trapezius, levator, scalenes, and other muscles, as appropriateProgress each unique patient as appropriate and indicatedRecommend a ROM and self-stretching program for home as appropriate Hand and forearm weakness/atrophy (also shoulder/scapular muscles)Increase strength of hand muscles and other identified weak musclesTherapeutic exercises _ Weakened muscles should be strengthened using a generalized fitness program, emphasizing progressive resistive exercises targeting the weaker muscles (external rotation, hand intrinsics, supination, etc.). Free weights, resistance tubing, grip ball, finger webs, therapy putty, and weighted sticks may be used, as appropriate for each patientProgress each patient as appropriate and indicatedRecommend a strengthening program for home as indicated  Restrictions in participation in causative task, which may be essential to patient's occupationRestore prior functional capacity in daily activities and occupational activities, as ableFunctional training _ Functional strengthening and scapular stabilization exercises for UE movements in daily activities. These exercises should be performed to address weakened musculature of the UE identified in the evaluation, and should be performed in later stages of recovery by simulating functional and occupational tasks (as well as the causative task) _ _ Constraint-induced movement therapy _ Termed sensory motor retuning (SMR) in FHD patients, this intervention has recently been studied primarily in case and pilot studies. In this therapy, the unaffected or compensating digit(s) are immobilized in a normal resting position during the activity to promote appropriate and functional use of the affected portions of the extremity. This may be done for several hours at a time, but not to excessive fatigue(14) _ _ Correction of faulty postureProgress each patient as appropriate and indicatedRecommend functional training at home as indicated ."
