            "Hypertension (HTN) is defined as two or more readings of elevated arterial blood pressure (BP). It commonly goes undetected for years until diagnosed by repeated routine medical screening. Systolic BP and diastolic BP are usually both elevated, although older adults often have isolated systolic HTN(1)",
            "According to the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Health Information Center, a service of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, BP in adults is classified as follows: \u2013Optimal BP: < 120/ < 80(1) \u2013Pre-HTN:  defined as a range of 120\u2013139/80\u201389  mmHg; indicates increased risk of developing hypertension.(1) Isolated high-normal  diastolic BP (80\u201389  mmHg) in adults younger than 50 years of age is associated with increased risk of developing stage 1 HTN(23) \u2013Stage 1 HTN: when systolic BP is 140\u2013159  mmHg or diastolic BP is 90\u201399  mmHg (i.e., 140\u2013159/90\u201399  mmHg)(1) \u2013Stage 2 HTN: when \u2265 160/\u2265 100mmHg(1)",
            "The 2014 Evidence-based  guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: Report from the panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee  recommends initiating pharmacological treatment to lower BP in the general population as follows:(7) \u2013Patients > 60 years of age with systolic BP > 150 mmHg or diastolic BP > 90 mmHg: treat to a goal of systolic BP < 150 mmHg and diastolic BP < 90 mmHg \u2013In the general adult population younger than 60 years, start pharmacologic treatment when diastolic BP is > 90 mmHg and/or systolic BP is > 140 mmHg and treat to a goal of diastolic BP < 90 mmHg and systolic BP < 140 mmHg \u2013The preferred pharmacological agents initially for the non-Black  population are thiazide-type  diuretics, angiotensin-converting  enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), or angiotensin-receptor  blockers (ARBs). ACE inhibitors or ARBs are preferred in persons with diabetes and patients with chronic kidney disease, whereas the preferred initial agents for the Black population are thiazide-type  diuretics or CCBs",
            "Approximately 1 in 3 adults in the United States has HTN. Only about half of these persons (52%) have their elevated BP under control(9)",
            "HTN is a common, interrelated, and modifiable factor that increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Complications associated with HTN include  coronary artery disease, left ventricular hypertrophy, myocardial infarction, heart failure, peripheral artery disease, chronic kidney disease, cerebrovascular disease, cerebral hemorrhage, transient ischemic attack, and retinal changes(1)",
            "Nonpharmacological interventions (e.g., lifestyle modifications) and annual monitoring are recommended for everyone with BP > 120/ > 80 mmHg(1,24) \u2013Health-promoting  lifestyle modifications to prevent the progressive rise in BP with age include weight loss, limiting alcohol intake, reducing sodium intake and maintaining potassium intake, exercise, and smoking cessation(14)",

            "MAP is also determined by the product of CO times SVR, plus the central venous pressure (CVP)\u2013MAP = (CO x SVR) + CVP\u2013Under normal conditions CVP is zero, but in pulmonary HTN it increases and cannot be ignored\u2013CO is the product of heart rate (HR) times cardiac stroke volume\u2013SVR is directly related to vascular tone, which increases acutely with vasoconstriction and chronically with arterialstiffening and endothelial dysfunction",
            "Pharmacological management of HTN is aimed at reducing the factors that increase MAP\u2013Beta-receptor  (beta) blockers and some CCBs lower HR, and thus CO, at rest as well as during physical activity\u2013Diuretics lower BP by reducing blood plasma volume and CO\u2013Vasodilators lower SVR. Among these drugs are the ACE inhibitors, (ARBs, alpha-adrenoreceptor  antagonists (alphablockers), some CCBs, and some beta blockers (e.g., carvedilol, nebivolol)\u2013Combination therapy (prescription of two or more antihypertensive agents) is often used to manage BP in patients withHTN",

            "Aerobic exercise training \u2013The 2014 guidelines of the American College of Sports Medicine for exercise testing and prescription suggest the following components for aerobic and resistance exercise programs for patients with HTN:(2) -Frequency: Light aerobic exercise on most days of the week, preferably all; low-intensity  resistance exercise 2\u20133 times per week -Intensity: Light to moderate aerobic exercise (i.e., 40% to less than 60% of VO 2reserve or heart rate reserve). The RPE should be 9 to 11 (on Borg 6\u201320  scale), supplemented by light resistance training at 40\u201360%  of 1-repetition  maximum  -Time: 30\u201360  minutes per day of continuous or intermittent aerobic exercise. If intermittent, a minimum of 10-minute bouts for a total of 30\u201360 minutes. Resistance training should consist of 8\u201312 repetitions for each major muscle group -Type: The emphasis should be on aerobic activities such as walking, jogging, cycling, and swimming. Free weights or machine weights for resistance training \u2013Authors of a 2019 systematic review (17 meta-analyses  and one systematic review involving 594,129 adults over 17 years of age) examining the use of physical activity (PA) to prevent and treat HTN concluded the following:(29) -Strong evidence supports: -An inverse dose-response  relationship between PA and incident HTN in adults without HTN -In adults with HTN, PA reduces the progression of CVD -In adults with pre-HTN,  HTN, and normal BP, PA reduces BP -The response of BP to PA is dependent on resting BP, with adults with pre-HTN  seeing more benefit than normotensives -Insufficient evidence was found for the factors of age, sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and weight status -Insufficient evidence was found on the frequency, intensity, time, and duration of PA -The authors suggest that future research adhere to standard BP measurement protocols and classification schemes for clearer answers to questions that remain regarding PA and BP \u2013Authors of a 2017 meta-analysis  of the effect of aerobic exercise on BP in hypertensive patients concluded that significant reductions in systolic BP were seen but not in diastolic BP in patients who did aerobic exercise when compared to controls(30) -Based on 13 studies involving 802 participants \u2013Authors of a 2018 systematic review and meta-analysis comparing the effect of high-intensity  (HI) versus moderate-intensity  (MOD) aerobic training on BP of adults with pre- to established HTN concluded that HI and MOD aerobic training caused similar reductions in BP but HI aerobic training had greater improvements in VO 2max(31) -Based on 7 studies with 245 participants",
            "Resistance exercise (RE) training and concurrent exercise training (CET) \u2013RE training might lower BP in persons with HTN. General guidelines recommend light-to-moderate  intensity dynamic weight lifting, preferably on machines, two or more nonconsecutive days per week(2) \u2013Authors of a 2016 meta-analysis  examining the effect of CET (i.e., combining aerobic and dynamic resistance training) as a hypertensive therapy concluded that the benefits of CET were similar to what is seen with aerobic exercise(32) -Based on 68 trials with 4,110 participants -The authors felt that the quality of the evidence limited their ability to make conclusions and they encouraged further RCTs",
            "Isometric handgrip (IHG) exercise training \u2013Authors of a meta-analysis  evaluating the effect of IHG exercise training on resting BP in healthy adults concluded that IHG lowers resting systolic BP and diastolic BP and may be effective in the prevention of HTN(33) -Based on 7 trials including 157 subjects -Systolic BP, diastolic BP, and HR in prehypertensive subjects were all significantly decreased by IHG training -Systolic BP and diastolic BP in medicated hypertensive group and normotensive group were significantly decreased by IHG training \u2013The intensity of the IHG training appears to make a difference in the benefit(34) -Based on an Australian study involving 40 hypertensive individuals between the ages of 36 and 65 -Groups were at 30% maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) and 5% MVC. Treatment was for 8 weeks, 3 days a week -Positive benefits (7 mmHg reduction in systolic BP and a 4mmHg reduction in MAP) were seen with exercise at 30%MVC but not with 5% MVC. No changes in DBP were seen with either group",
            "Aquatic therapy \u2013Aquatic exercise therapy and dry-land  aerobic training are equally effective in the reduction of systolic BP over 12 weeks of training(8) -Based on an RCT in Brazil involving 52 postmenopausal hypertensive women -Exercise sessions were 50 minutes 3 times per week. After 12 weeks the average decrease in systolic BP was 12 mmHg for both the dry-land  exercise group and the aquatic exercise group when compared to the nonintervention control group  .
