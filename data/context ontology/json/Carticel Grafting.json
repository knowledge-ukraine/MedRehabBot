            "Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) is a technique for resurfacing a chronic, symptomatic, full-thickness  articular cartilage defect, most commonly in the knee.(9) This tissue-engineered approach is mainly for a single tibiofemoral or patellofemoral osteochondral lesion, although its potential role in treating ankle (talus) joint defects is under investigation; a 2017 systematic review of studies of ACI for talar cartilage defects indicated the need for well-designed  randomized trials(10)",
            "ACI is a two-stage  procedure: 1) chondrocytes are first obtained arthroscopically from the patient\u2019s healthy articular cartilage and cultured in vitro for several weeks; and 2) the cultured chondrocytes are then implanted under a sealed periosteal flap or matrix at the prepared site. The original procedure (ACI1) involves implantation during open knee surgery(9)",
            "The second-generation  method (ACI2) uses a bilayer collagen membrane. The third-generation  method (ACI3) uses cell carriers, a cell-seeded matrix, or a polymer scaffold matrix to hold the chondrocytes;this is also called matrix-applied  chondrocyte implantation (MACI) and autologous matrix-induced  chondrogenesis (AMIC).Some third-generation  methods also are described by the type of membrane used to form the matrix; e.g., autologous cultured chondrocytes on porcine collagen membrane.(11) ACI2 and ACI3 do not require arthrotomy at the time of implantation.(9) They might reduce complications and rehabilitation time associated with open implantation(9)",
            "Strict adherence to a guided rehabilitation protocol is required for optimal outcomes. Most protocolsinvolve continuous passive motion (CPM), progressive partial weight-bearing  (PWB), full ROM, electrotherapeutic modalities, and controlled therapeutic exercises",
            "Current rehabilitation protocols after tibiofemoral resurfacing aim to achieve full WB by 11\u201312  weeks postoperatively following the original ACI or ACI2 methods, and by 6\u20139 weeks after ACI3(2,11). Protocols for patellofemoral are not as well-defined  but single patellofemoral defect repairs can WB immediately after surgery(11)",
            "(This review was originally about ACI, but this technique has evolved with the second and third generations. More current research refers to the MACI procedure and this is noted when it is specific to MACI) "

        "pathogenesis": [
            "Hyaline cartilage degeneration is chronic because its limited vascularity mostly prevents intrinsic repair. Consequently,operative solutions have evolved for cartilage repair(9)",
            "The natural progression of articular cartilage defects is unclear. Symptomatic defects are associated with full-thicknessosteochondral damage, sclerosis, fragmentation, ischemia, and the development of cartilage flaps and loose bodies.Advanced signs include synovitis with persistent effusion(9)",
            "Damaged articular cartilage has a very limited capacity for self-regeneration  due in large part to its acellular structure.Consequently, current opinion is that untreated defects tend to progressively degenerate and increase the risk ofearly-onset osteoarthritis(9)",
            "There is no accepted uniform approach to surgical management of articular cartilage defects of the knee\u2013Microfracture had been the gold standard against which other articular cartilage repair techniques were evaluated.Microfracture involves drilling small holes into the bone under the area that is damaged, with the scar tissue fromthe resulting clots eventually becoming fibrocartilage.(9) The majority of articles compare microfracture to ACI (SeePrognosis , below)\u2013ACI is one of the numerous methods used. The goal of ACI is to resurface a full-thickness,  moderately large (2.5\u20134.0 cm2)defect with hyaline-like  cartilage and is distinct from techniques that promote the growth of fibrocartilage (e.g., abrasionarthroplasty, subchondral drilling, microfracture). Fibrocartilage has biomechanical properties inferior to those of hyalinecartilage(9)",
            "The two-stage  ACI procedure involves arthroscopic harvesting of the patient\u2019s healthy articular cartilage and extractionof chondrocytes, which are cultured in vitro for several weeks. The second stage varies according to the generation of thesurgical technique used to complete the implantation(9)\u2013The first-generation  procedure utilizes an open-knee  surgery that assesses the defective portion of the knee, followedby harvesting of the periosteum. Suturesare then applied to the periosteal cover. The surgeon assesses the suture line forwater-tightness,  applies a fibrin-glue  sealant, and implants the cultured chondrocytes followed by closure of the wound\u2013The ACI2 procedure uses a monolayer membrane of porcine-type collagen to patch the lesion with the culturedchondrocytes instead of the periosteal cover\u2013The cultivation of chondrocytes in the ACI3 procedure includes the addition of transforming growth factor-\u03b2  and otherspecific growth factors. This helps prevent the cultured chondrocytes from expressing fibroblast-specific type I collagen(vs. the cartilage-specific  type II collagen), and it also produces an extracellular matrix for implanting the chondrocytes.Hence, it is referred to as matrix-applied  chondrocyte implantation or as autologous matrix-induced  chondrogenesis(11)",

However, patients in the AR group used crutches for less time and had outcomes comparable to those of the CR group at up to 24 months without damaging the graft integrity \u2013Authors of a 2018 systematic review looking at outcomes after MACI with FWB at 6weeks, 8weeks, and 11\u201312  weeks concluded that there were no significant differences in outcomes or adverse effects of the various protocols(16) \u2013Authors examining the 10-year  clinical and radiological outcomes of an RCT(8) comparing FWB by 8 and 12 weeks after MACI concluded that 8weeks to FWB was safe and that MACI was associated with high satisfaction levels and tissue durability beyond 10 years(17) -Based on an Australian RCT in which 60 of the original 70 patients were available for follow-up  at 10 years -Clinical outcomes: patient-reported  outcomes, maximal isokinetic knee extensor and flexor strength, and functional hop capacity -Radiological outcomes: high-resolution  MRI with MOCART.

            "Tibiofemoral/patellofemoral ACI is usually followed by a lengthy, guided rehabilitation protocol. Patient education and compliance are necessary to achieve maximum benefits. The exact protocol varies slightly among cartilage repair centers. General postoperative guidelines involve(2)  \u2013Maximum protection of the repair site during the first 3 months -Restricted/controlled WB, with the goal of FWB at 6\u201312  weeks, depending on the ACI procedure and restrictions -Avoidance of shearing forces at the knee using an orthosis (e.g., unloader brace) for 3\u20138 weeks \u2013Progressive restoration of active and passive ROM -CPM for 2 hours/day while inpatient (3\u20135 days), then 6\u20138 hours/day for 6 weeks -ROM goal for 6 weeks: 90\u00b0 to 130\u00b0 -Patellar mobilizations started immediately, or according to physician if patellofemoral ACI \u2013Hydrotherapy beginning at 2\u20134 weeks (after wound is healed without infection) \u2013Progressive muscle activation and strengthening -Closed kinetic-chain  (CKC) exercises initially -Program depends in part on location of graft \u2013Proprioceptive (neuromuscular) reeducation, with biofeedback as needed \u2013Electrotherapeutic/physical modalities \u2013Progressive therapeutic aerobic exercise (with emphasis on cycling or rowing ergometry vs. treadmill)",
