Furthermore, children who have poor phonological andphonemic awareness have difficulty recognizing, identifying, and manipulating soundswithin spoken language, placing them at risk for having reading difficulties(4,5)\u2013Authors of a meta-analysis  in Norway of the relationship between three measures of children's phonological skills(phonemic awareness, rime awareness, and verbal short-term  memory) and children's word-reading  skills found thatphonemic awareness was the strongest correlate of individual differences in word-reading ability.(6) Phonemic awarenessrefers to the ability to hear, identify, and manipulate individual sounds in spoken words.

The child's independent performance on a task is compared with the child's performance on the same task after scaffolding or instruction -The use of dynamic screening measures for phonological awareness has been suggested for identifying kindergarten students who are at risk for reading difficulties.(13) Because kindergarten students often lack literacy experience at the beginning of kindergarten, static measures can demonstrate floor effects and limit the ability to predict future reading disabilities in this population. Research in the United States comparing a static measure with a dynamic measure of phonological awareness with kindergarten students (N = 186) showed that a dynamic screening measure more accurately predicted end-of-year  reading achievement than static measures, providing preliminary support for the usefulness of a dynamic screening measure(13) -Authors of a study conducted in the United States investigating the use of a dynamic assessment measure to evaluate inference-making  skills in second-grade  students (N = 100) found that the researcher-developed measures correlated significantly with standardized measures of reading and explained a significant amount of unique variance in reading comprehension above and beyond vocabulary and word-identification skills(14)(15) An individually administered test designed to measure phonemic awareness, phonological memory, and rapid naming for children from the age of 5 years(16) The WJ-III  DRB includes 10 individually administered, norm-referenced  subtests for reading (Letter-Word Identification, Passage Comprehension, Word Attack, Reading V ocabulary, Reading Fluency, Spelling of Sounds, Sound Awareness, Sound Blending, Oral V ocabulary, Oral Comprehension) for children from the age of 2 years(17) The TOWRE contains two subtests that measure individual phonemic decoding and sight-word  reading skills for children from the age of 6 years(37) A measure of early reading abilities for children from the age of 3 years, 6 months to 8 years, 6 months",

            "Phonemic awareness instruction: Phonemic awareness is the ability to hear and manipulate phonemes (i.e., the smallest phonetic unit that is capable of distinguishing words in a language) in syllables and words. Phonemic awareness is one aspect of phonological awareness, which refers to awareness of larger spoken units of language such as syllables and rhyming words. The NRP reported that explicit phonemic awareness instruction (which differs from phonics instruction) is highly effective in improving phonemic awareness, reading, and spelling. For most children, phonemic awareness instruction does not need to be long (more than 20 hours); however, students with reading disabilities might need additional instruction. Phonemic awareness activities include:(18) \u2013identifying the individual sounds in words. Example: \"What is the first sound in dog?\" (/d/) \u2013recognizing common sounds in different words. Example: \"Tell me the sound that is the same in bike, boy, and bus\" (/b/) \u2013categorizing phonemes. Example: \"Which word does not belong? Dog, dish, bus\" (bus) \u2013phoneme blending. Example: \"What is the word /s/ /k/ /u/ /l/?\" (school) \u2013phoneme deletion. Example. \"What is street  without the /s/?\" (treet) \u2013phoneme segmentation: \"How many phonemes (sounds) in keep?\" (3. /k/ /i/ /p/)",
            "Phonics instruction: Phonics instruction focuses on teaching letter-sound correspondences and letter pattern\u2013sound correspondences and how to use them in spelling and reading.(18) The NRP found that systematic phonics instruction is beneficial for students in kindergarten through sixth grade as well as for children having difficulty learning to read. Systematic phonics instruction differs from incidental phonics instruction in that a scope and sequence of phonics elements are taught in a systematic way rather than highlighting phonics elements incidentally as they appear in text. The NRP emphasized that phonics instruction needs to include practice in automatic application of phonics skills to text and be integrated with the development of phonemic, fluency, text reading, and comprehension skills(18) \u2013In a study conducted in Australia, researchers compared sight-word  training to phonics instruction for children with dyslexia. In this study, a group of 36 children with dyslexia received 8 weeks of phonics instruction followed by 8 weeks of sight-word  training, another group of 36 children did sight-word training first, followed by phonics training, and a third group of 32 children received both types of therapies simultaneously over the course of 16 weeks. At the conclusion of the 16 weeks, researchers assessed the effects of the interventions on sight-word  reading (as measured by number of trained and untrained irregular words read correctly), phonics reading ability (as measured by fluency of nonword reading and number of nonwords read correctly), and general reading ability (as measured by single-word  reading fluency and accuracy in reading comprehension tasks). Researchers reported that sight-word  training resulted in significantly higher  accuracy in sight-word  reading tasks and phonics training resulted in significantly higher scores in phonics reading tasks, as expected. Additionally, simultaneously training in phonics and sight words significantly improved overall reading ability to a similar degree. Researchers noted that, in terms of overall reading ability, having the children do phonics instruction prior to sight-word  training appeared to be slightly more beneficial than doing the training in the opposite order(51)",
            "Morphological awareness instruction: Morphological awareness refers to the ability to recognize and manipulate the smallest units of meaning in a language, including base words, prefixes, and suffixes. Recent studies have indicated that morphological awareness intervention can improve reading skills \u2013Researchers in the United States examined the effectiveness of a multilinguistic intervention to improve reading and spelling in 22 second-grade students who struggled with literacy.(32) Participants were randomly assigned to a treatment with a phonological and orthographic emphasis or a treatment with an additional morphological awareness focus. The orthographic treatment included word sorts, word building, and applied orthographic pattern activities. The morphological intervention group included word sorts, word building, and applied activities to learn morphological patterns (e.g., plural \u2013s, past tense \u2013ed, \u2013tion).  After 9 consecutive days with 90-minute  treatment sessions at a literacy camp, both groups performed better on standardized measures of word identification and word attack and on a nonstandardized spelling test of orthographic patterns. The morphological intervention group performed better on standardized measures of reading comprehension and spelling and on a nonstandardized spelling test of morphological patterns. The researchers concluded that the findings support the use of a multilinguistic approach for primary grade students with language and literacy deficits \u2013Researchers in the United States implemented a 9-week  morphological awareness intervention with kindergarten\u2013second-grade  students from low socioeconomic status homes (N = 61).(33) Intervention was delivered within the school setting 4 days/week in 25-minute sessions in groups of 4\u20135. Students were taught to analyze, recognize, orally produce, and determine the spelling patterns of multimorphemic words. Results indicated that the most significant gains were on morphological awareness tasks. Students also made gains on other literacy tasks (word reading, reading comprehension, and spelling)",

There are two main approaches that have been used for building fluency, guided repeated oral reading and independent silent reading \u2013Guided repeated oral reading: Children who have poor reading fluency are often asked to repeatedly read passages with guidance from a teacher, clinician, parent, or peer to have multiple exposures to the same words and to increase their speed and accuracy during text reading -The NRP concluded that guided repeated reading improves word recognition, fluency, and comprehension across a range of grade levels(18) -Authors of a synthesis of research examining fluency interventions specifically for students with learning disabilities evaluated 24 studies and concluded that repeated reading interventions for students with LD were associated with improvements in reading rate, accuracy, and comprehension.(2) In addition, repeated reading with a model (teacher reading with students) was found to be more effective than repeated reading without a model. In addition, fluency developed more quickly when students were aware of their fluency goals and were given corrective feedback and information on their progress -Authors of a more recent review of research regarding repeated reading with children with LD found that this practice is lacking a strong evidence base due to the lack of studies meeting methodological criteria for quality research based on standards set by Horner et al. and Gersten et al.(19,20) The authors proposed that even in the absence of firm evidence, teachers and clinicians can continue to implement repeated reading practice because 1) it is aligned with multiple theoretical frameworks that suggest its use for students who need to improve fluency and 2) effect sizes in meta-analyses of fluency interventions have indicated that repeated reading is likely to positively affect fluency outcomes for those who need to improve fluency(21) \u2013Independent silent reading: In this approach, students are asked to read independently and silently with limited guidance or feedback. The NRP concluded that there is not sufficient research evidence of high methodological quality to support the practice of independent silent reading.(18) Authors of a synthesis of fluency interventions for students with LD confirmed that there is little evidence to suggest that independent silent reading builds fluency for these students(2) \u2013Video self-modeling  and peer modeling: Researchers in the United States compared the effects of video self-modeling and peer modeling on reading fluency for 6 children with learning disabilities in a multiple baseline design study. In the self-modeling  treatment group (n = 3), students watched a video of themselves reading fluently once a day  for 2 weeks.(31) The peer modeling group (n = 3) watched a peer read fluently once a day for 2 weeks. Each group was administered twice-weekly curriculum-based  measures of reading fluency at baseline, during intervention, and at follow-up  (up to 24 probes dependent on student attendance). A comparison group (n = 3) also received the curriculum-based  measures to distinguish the effects of the probes/researchers\u2019 presence from the treatment itself. Students in both experimental groups improved their fluency, with 2 students in the self-modeling  group making substantial and immediate gains beyond the other students. Positive changes in attitude were also seen in both experimental groups",
            "V ocabulary instruction: V ocabulary knowledge has long been recognized as an important component of reading instruction. For most students who struggle with language and reading, vocabulary instruction is an essential part of comprehensive reading intervention \u2013The NRP found that there is some evidence that vocabulary instruction leads to gains in reading comprehension and that the following methods may be useful: previewing words before text reading, repeated exposure to words in various contexts, using computer technology to review words, and actively engaging the student in word learning.(18) The NRP concluded that vocabulary instruction was important for improving reading comprehension but found little research to specify the best methods of vocabulary instruction and the measurement of vocabulary growth(18) \u2013Authors of a study conducted in the United States examining vocabulary instruction within an RTI model (see below for full description of RTI model) used shared story-book  reading to teach new vocabulary words to students who were at risk for reading difficulties and to students who were not at risk for reading difficulties.(22) Participants included 224 1st first-grade  students, with 98 identified as being at risk for reading difficulty. In a quasi-experimental  design, all students were provided with whole-class  vocabulary instruction (Tier 1) and 49 of the at-risk  students were provided with additional, more intensive instruction (20-minute,  small-group  instruction/2 x week). Intervention took place over 2 weeks (2 books/8 target words). Results indicated that the at-risk  students who received intensive instruction scored significantly higher on posttest measures of target word knowledge than the control group of at-risk  students immediately after intervention; however, these gains were not maintained at 4 weeks postintervention.(22) The researchers suggested that vocabulary intervention might need to be lengthened so that the at-risk  children can maintain their gains in word knowledge(22)",
            "Text comprehension instruction: Students can be taught specific cognitive strategies or reasoning skills with the goal of improving their comprehension \u2013The NRP found that teaching a combination of reading comprehension techniques is most effective. Types of strategies/ techniques include:(18) -comprehension monitoring: Students are taught to be more aware of their understanding (or lack thereof) -cooperative learning: Students work together to use reading strategies -graphic and semantic organizers: Students make visual or graphic representations of what they read -question answering: The teacher/SLP poses comprehension questions before, during, or after reading -question generation: Students are taught to ask themselves questions about what they read -story structure: Students are taught to use story mapping to help them recall the details and parts of a story -summarization: After reading a text, students are asked to summarize (orally or in writing) what they have just read \u2013Authors of a meta-analysis  of 40 reading comprehension intervention studies published between 1995 and 2006 found that effect sizes were high for criterion-referenced  measures (0.69 for treatment effects; 0.75 for generalization effects) and moderate for standardized measures (0.52).(23) The authors concluded that these outcomes were similar to, though slightly lower than, those of previously published meta-analyses.  A wide variety of treatment methods were found to be effective, including text enhancements, questioning, and cognitive strategies. Most of the treatment approaches included strategies to assist students in attending to and thinking more systematically about what they had just read. Examples of strategies include highlighting, outlining, illustrating, organization of text, summarizing the text, predicting outcomes, proving main ideas, analyzing text structure, and providing explanations. The authors concluded that students with reading difficulties did not spontaneously employ such strategies and that any instruction to help them systematically employ these techniques would improve their ability to construct meaning from text \u2013Authors of a meta-analysis  conducted in Germany analyzed the results of 22 RCTs of reading interventions for children and adolescents with reading disabilities (date range of publication of reviewed RCTs was unspecified).(30) Findings include: -Phonics instruction was the most investigated approach and the only approach that had statistically confirmed efficacy for reading and spelling performance  -Mean effect sizes of other reading treatment approaches were not significant -Subgroup analyses did not yield definitive conclusions about specific factors that contributed to an intervention\u2019s efficacy \u2013A research synthesis of 18 studies on interventions designed to improve learning from informational text for students with learning disabilities in elementary school (K\u20135)  was conducted.(35) Findings included moderate to large effect sizes on researcher-developed  measures for cognitive strategy instruction. Researchers also found that social studies interventions utilizing graphic organizers were associated with improved outcomes; however, improvements using graphic organizers for science content were not statistically significant. Researchers also found that more than 90% of interventions focused on basic skills (fact recall, generating the main idea) rather than more advanced textual analysis as proposed by recent Common Core State Standards (CCSS)",
            "Computer technology and reading instruction: The NRP reported positive findings from the limited research studies on computer use in reading instruction.(18) Two promising trends include the use of hypertexts to link to definitions or supporting material and the use of computers for word processing(18) \u2013In a longitudinal study, researchers in Sweden examined the effects of three computerized interventions on reading skills of 130 children with reading disabilities in second grade.(29) Participants were randomly assigned to4treatment groups and received 1 of 4 interventions: 1) a phonologicallyoriented computerized program, 2) a reading-comprehension-oriented  computerized program, 3) a combination of the two programs, 4) traditional specialized reading instruction. All participants received 25one-on-one  instruction sessions of 15\u201320minutes,  with their special education teacher. All groups improved their reading skills. The group that received combined computerized training showed more improvement than the group with traditional special instruction. At 1-year  follow-up,  the group with the combined training had the least number of students requiring special education services (7 out of 25)",
            "Early intervention: Early intervention for reading (kindergarten\u2013third  grade) is supported not only by treatment effects in multiple research studies, but also by fMRI studies indicating that systematic, evidence-based  reading intervention can lead to significant and lasting changes in brain organization.(5) Specifically, fMRI studies have measured activation of the left occipito-temporal  area in poor readers before intervention and found the activation to differ from that of typical readers. After intervention, the subjects improved in reading fluency and showed more typical activation patterns in this area as well as other areas in both hemispheres(5)",
            "Parent training in shared book reading: Shared book reading between a parent and child has the potential for bolstering language development and emergent literacy(34) \u2013Researchers in the United States conducted a methodological review of studies investigating Reach Out and Read (ROR), a program that teaches parents strategies to incorporate while sharing books with children.(34) ROR is a national initiative aimed at improving literacy skills of children from economically disadvantaged backgrounds by distributing books and by supporting medical professionals to provide details about the importance of reading and strategies to incorporate into shared book reading. The review found variable quality and methodological limitations among some of the 11 studies investigating ROR. They also found that none of the studies followed children after school entry to determine if the effects of shared book reading led to academic success. They recommended further studies with more robust experimental designs to assess the effects of ROR",
            "RTI: The RTI approach is a multitiered framework that involves universal screening to identify students at risk for reading difficulties, systematic evidence-based classroom instruction, ongoing progress monitoring, and implementation of effective interventions for students who require more intensive instruction.(7,24) Tier 1 of the model involves providing high-quality, evidence-based  instruction in a general education classroom. All students are screened at the beginning of the school year with a criterion-referenced  or norm-referenced  instrument to determine which students may benefit from additional instruction (e.g., students who fall below the 25th percentile on a screening measure). Tier 2 consists of small-group  instruction and is directed towards students who continue to have difficulties despite the high-quality intervention. Their responsiveness to more intensive intervention is monitored after relatively short periods of time (e.g., 8 weeks). Tier 3 is provided for students who respond minimally to the second tier intervention and require specialized, more intensive instruction. When students fail to respond or respond minimally to the most intensive tier of instruction, they receive a comprehensive evaluation to determine their eligibility for special education services and may receive a diagnosis of LD or reading disability. Multiple research studies on RTI have indicated promising gains for children who receive early, evidence-based  intervention.(25,26,27) SLPs work in collaboration with general and special education teachers within an RTI model in roles such as the following: \u2013Collaborate with school professionals to design interventions to improve Tier 1 instruction(28)  \u2013Administer progress monitoring measures to determine if the children are meeting benchmarks and to identify those who need additional instruction(28) \u2013Deliver Tier 2 and Tier 3 support for at-risk  students(28)",
