            "The elbow joint is stabilized by bony articulations and ligaments and stabilized dynamically by attached muscles. A strong force is required to disrupt the joint. Although the elbow joint is relatively stable, posterior elbow dislocations are fairly common, ranking second in major dislocations after the shoulder(8)",
            "The most common simple elbow dislocations are posterolateral and progress from medial ligament tears. Dislocations are considered simple when there is no fracture beyond small avulsion fractures (1\u20132 mm)(10)",
            "Elbow dislocation is classified by the direction of displacement of the proximal ulna (i.e., whether posterior or anterior) relative to the distal humerus. Posterolateral dislocation is the most common displacement direction. Rarely, the humerus may separate the radius and ulna, producing a divergent dislocation; these are typically pediatric injuries(8)",
            "Severe ligament tears (e.g., resulting in joint instability) and periarticular fractures often complicate elbow dislocation in adults (For more information on elbow fractures, see Clinical Review\u2026Fracture, Elbow  ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T708543)",
            "Surgical treatment usually is required for unstable dislocation; i.e., one that cannot be reduced externally. Following open reduction and soft tissue repair, if the elbow remains unstable an external fixator (static or hinged) may be used to maintain the reduction. If a hinged fixator is used, then early mobilization may be allowed(7)",
            "After a standard of 3 to 10 days immobilization,rehabilitation therapists attempt to minimize the development of contracture and chronic elbow stiffness with gentle ROM exercises while maintaining elbow joint stability(1) or application of equipment . Desired Outcomes/Outcome Measures"

Following immobilization, use of an articulating brace allowing progressive degrees of mobilization over time may be initiated.A major goal of rehabilitation is to restore elbow mobility in a safe arc of ROM while optimizing joint stability(8,12)",
