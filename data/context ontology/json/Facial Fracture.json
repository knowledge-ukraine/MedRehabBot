There is an inferior displacement ofthe orbital roof without involvement of the supraorbital rim or frontal sinus(20)\u2013Two theories exist on the mechanism of injury: buckling mechanism and hydraulic mechanism. In the buckling theory, theforce is transmitted from the thick orbital rim to the weaker walls, resulting in the fracture.
