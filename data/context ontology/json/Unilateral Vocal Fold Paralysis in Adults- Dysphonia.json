In addition, the laryngeal examination serves to determine the position of the larynx (e.g., high, low) and any other characteristics of the vocal folds, including vocal fold closure and physical aspects of the folds (e.g., swollen, tense). Patient should be referred for a follow-up  biopsy when growths are identified.(15) Laryngeal examinations may involveA mirror examination involves placing a mirror in the back of the throat of the patient. V ocal folds can be visualized by reflecting light down to the voice box(19)Rigid endoscopy is performed with a rigid tube placed into the oral or pharyngeal cavity. A rigid laryngoscope provides the clearest view of the larynx; however, the tongue needs to be held by the examiner, and normal speech production cannot be performed during the examination. A flexible laryngoscope uses fiberoptic technology and can be passed through the nose to the back of the throat and allows for examination of the larynx during voicing(20)Videostroboscopic examination allows the examiner to see the vocal folds vibrating in slow motion and provides information on any abnormalities present during voice production (e.g., abnormal closure). It is performed with instrumentation used for oral endoscopy or nasendoscopy and is combined with a strobe light correlated to vocal fold vibration.(20) The examiner can view aspects of vibratory function such as the mucosal wave, vibratory amplitude, periodicity, and symmetry.(8) Vibratory parameters usually are rated on a Likert scale (e.g., 1-5)Electroglottography is diagnostic procedure that provides information on vocal fold closure by measuring the electrical resistance of two electrodes placed around the neck(20) LEMG is an electrophysiologic evaluation of the laryngeal musculature, allowing the physician to differentiate between vocal fold immobility caused by cricoarytenoid joint pathology and immobility caused by vocal fold paralysis(31)The SLP can informally evaluate the patient\u2019s vocal quality and breathing patterns during an interview.

Improvements were maintained at 1 year and 5 years after operation. In addition, improvements in acoustic measurements of shimmer and jitter were evident at 6 months after the operation and were maintained to a significant extent at 5 years postoperation(29)",
            "Speech-language  therapy for dysphonia \u2013Authors of a systematic review that included articles published between 1980 and 2006 reported on three main types of voice therapy for dysphonia: -Hygienic voice therapy: based in the theory that functional voice disorders arise from and are maintained by harmful or traumatic patient behaviors (e.g., repeated throat clearing, dehydration) and that the elimination of these behaviors will resolve dysphonia and prevent recurrence.(35) Researchers found that the evidence to support the use of hygienic voice therapy in isolation was lacking. Review authors stated that unless scientific evidence provides evidence to support the role of hygienic voice therapy as the primary therapeutic intervention, this type of therapy should be used only as one part of a larger voice program.(35) The outcomes of the group-based hygienic voice therapy studies included in the review indicated that there were significant changes in knowledge about traumatic vocal behaviors; however, this did not necessarily equate to a change in behaviors(35) -Symptomatic voice therapy: based on the principles of symptom modification; clinicians attempt to remediate specific abnormal vocal symptoms (e.g., pitch, vocal quality, volume) with individualized, facilitative techniques (e.g., humming, yawn-sigh technique, chewing, vocal fold adduction exercises).(35) The majority of studies reviewed for symptomatic voice therapy were found to have methodological problems, resulting in doubts about the strength of the evidence. Review authors reported that the evidence was preliminary and promising, but could not be used to draw firm conclusions about the efficacy of symptomatic voice therapy.(35) Additionally, review authors noted that most studies investigated the effects of comprehensive symptomatic voice therapy programs, which makes it difficult to determine the effect of any single therapeutic technique(35) -Physiologic voice therapy: based in the theory that the best way to remediate voice disorders is to modify the underlying physiology of voice production.(35) In physiologic voice therapy, clinicians aim to 1) improve the patient\u2019s balance of respiration, phonation, and resonance to produce voice; 2) increase the strength, health, and endurance of the patient\u2019s laryngeal musculature; and 3) help the patient develop and maintain healthy mucosa of the true vocal folds.(35) Review authors found that the evidence for physiologic voice therapy was the strongest and was supported both clinically and theoretically(35) \u2013Patient education about voice function and voice care -The SLP should educate the patient and/or caregiver on normal vocal fold function, the effect of UVFP, therapy techniques, and vocal hygiene. Pictures and models of the larynx are helpful in assisting patients and caregivers to understand why they cannot speak loudly and why their voice is breathy(3) \u2013Compensatory strategies -The SLP can use the first few sessions for diagnostic therapy. Strategies to achieve a stronger voice can be trialed. Strategies include:(3) -patient applies digital pressure to one side of the thyroid cartilage (side with the paralysis) while voicing -patient turns head to one side and then the other while voicing to determine if turning to one side results in a stronger voice -amplification: The patient can use a microphone to amplify the voice if it is inaudible. In a study conducted in the United States of 18 patients with vocal fold paralysis, Parkinson disease, and/or COPD, researchers compared the use  of a fiberoptic microphone to an electret microphone. The fiberoptic microphone was found to have better acoustic performance and was associated with better patient satisfaction than the electret microphone(33) -Undesirable, hyperfunctional vocal behaviors (e.g., speaking too loudly, using too high or too low pitch) should be identified and eliminated during the first sessions \u2013V ocal fold adduction exercises -Half-swallow  boom(3) -The steps to this technique include:(3) -the patient is instructed to take a breath and start to swallow. At the point of the half-swallow (at the peak of laryngeal elevation), the patient should say \u201cboom\u201d(21) -the patient produces boom in a low-pitched voice using the same technique(21) -the patient produces \u201cboom\u201d louder and with less breathiness(21) -the patient is instructed to turn head to each side and say \u201cboom\u201d each time using the same technique(21) -This technique is used to expand \u201cboom\u201d into words and phrases(21) -NOTE: This technique should be used sparingly and cautiously to avoid the development of vocal hyperfunction. There is little empirical evidence to support the use of this technique for UVFP(21) -Pushing exercises might be useful for patients with recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis who have a high pitch of voice production. However, for many patients, pushing/pulling/adduction exercises are contraindicated because they increase the effort needed to produce voice and can lead to compensatory patterns such as supraglottic hypofunction.(32) Steps include: -the patient is instructed to breathe in and posture on a vowel (as if about to say a vowel) without letting the air out(3) -the patient releases the vowel (vocalizes)(3) -the patient is instructed to glide down to a lower pitch as the vowel is released(3) -the patient can push hands together in front of the body or push down on the arms of a chair as the vowel is released. Another way to achieve isometric pressure is to lean into a door with elbows bent(3) -the patient can use the pushing exercise in conjunction with counting to 50 or reciting poetry(3) -The patient should maintain a constant pressure but not excessive effort(3) -the falsetto voice should be extinguished over a 3-week  period(3) -suggested frequency of this exercise is 3 times a day for the first week, 2 times day for the next 2 weeks, and then once a week. Schedule will vary depending on patient\u2019s progress(3) -NOTE: The patient must be observed carefully for signs of supraglottic hyperfunction or excessive vocal strain. If these are present, discontinue these techniques(3) \u2013V ocal function exercises -Steps of vocal function exercises include: -the patient is instructed to sustain the vowel /i/ for as long as possible (for pitch, use F above middle C for women and F below middle C for men)(3) -the patient should glide from the lowest pitch to the highest pitch on the word \u201cknoll\u201d(3) -the patient should glide from the highest pitch to the lowest pitch on the word \u201cknoll\u201d(3) -the patient should sustain the vowel /o/ on the notes C, D, E, F, and G for as long as possible (female patients start on middle C; males start one octave below middle C)(3) -The patient should produce vowels as gently and softly as possible without hard glottal attack(3) \u2013Lip and tongue trills: practicing lip trills (raspberries) and tongue trills assists the patient to achieve normal laryngeal tension(3) -The patient should master the lip or tongue trill at a comfortable pitch. The lip trill can be facilitated if the patient presses cheeks in with 2 fingers -The patient can practice trills with a variety of vowel sounds and pitch progressions",
            "In a prospective study involving 74 patients with UVFP, researchers in Italy found that early voice therapy resulted in recovery of paralyzed vocal fold motility in 51/74 patients (68.9%)(27)  \u2013V oice therapy program included pushing exercises, vocal function exercises, and laryngeal manipulations by the SLP(27) \u2013Frequency of therapy was twice per week with a mean number of 16.8 sessions; patients were all instructed to repeat the exercises daily at home during the treatment period(27)",
            "Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES): NMES is a therapeutic modality in which surface electrical stimulation is used to elicit muscle contraction through depolarization of the nerves that innervate that muscle.(34) At the time of publication, NMES is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) only for the treatment of dysphagia; however, researchers have explored the use of NMES for treatment of dysphonia as well. Authors of a case study with two adult female patients with dysphonia related to suspected superior laryngeal nerve damage reported positive outcomes from a program of combined voice therapy (i.e., vocal exercises) and NMES.(34) For both of these patients, the NMES was applied to the cricothyroid muscle in order to stimulate the superior laryngeal nerve(34) .
