            "Acquired acalculia is the loss of numerical knowledge and calculation ability caused by injury to the brain and characterized by an inability to execute mathematical operations.(1) The ability to perform arithmetical operations and understand mathematical concepts requires multiple conceptual abilities and cognitive skills, including language, calculation abilities, spatial knowledge, memory, perceptual abilities, and executive functioning.(2) Therefore, brain damage that affects any one of these aspects of a person\u2019s cognition can result in acalculia(2)",
            "Acalculia that results from a primary deficit of mathematical/computational skills in isolation is called anarithmetria or anarithmia(2)",
            "Acalculia often coexists with an acquired language disorder such as Broca\u2019s aphasia or Wernicke\u2019s aphasia or with acquired cognitive deficits such as a spatial disorder; however, it can also occur in isolation.(1,3,4) Despite the frequent co-occurrence  of aphasia and acalculia, the impairments of both receptive and expressive number processing and mathematical calculation are not necessarily due to language deficits(1,3,4)",
            "Gerstmann syndrome is a specific collection of impairments that result from damage to the left angular gyrus and results in acalculia, written language impairment (agraphia), an inability to distinguish right from left, and finger agnosia.(1,5) In Gerstmann syndrome, acalculia occurs without aphasia(1)"
