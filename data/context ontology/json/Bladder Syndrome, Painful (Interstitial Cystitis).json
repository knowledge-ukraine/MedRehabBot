Multimodal treatment often is needed to control patients\u2019 symptoms(10) Laser ablation, fulguration, or resection to treat Hunner\u2019s ulcers(1) Augmentation cystoplasty is performed to increase bladder capacity and decrease pressure, with or without partial cystectomy (bladder removal). It is generally not recommended(1) Partial cystectomy in severe cases, total cystectomy if completely refractory to medical therapy(2) Urinary diversion with total cystectomy only if disease is completely refractory to medical therapy(2)",

Instilled medications are injected directly into the bladder. This typically involves a mixture of heparin or pentosan polysulfate sodium, with lidocaine and sodium bicarbonate.(1) Lidocaine, heparin, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) may be administered in this manner(1) DMSO is the only FDA-approved  intravesical treatment; however, it is used less often now because of its side effects, specifically a garliclike  odor or taste on breath or skin that lasts 72 hours after treatment(1) Intravesical instillation of bacillus Calmette-Guerin  should not be offered outside of investigational study settings. Intravesical instillation of resiniferatoxin should not be offered(4) Some patients may try an OTC food additive known as Prelief for symptom control(1)",

SNS is generally first tried on an outpatient basis in the doctor's office with the implantation of a test lead.

            "The Interstitial Cystitis Guidelines Panel of the AUA conducted a systematic review of the literature published through 2009. The panel lists manual physical therapy techniques by appropriately trained clinicians as a second-line  treatment for IC.(4) First-line treatments include patient education, self-care  practices and behavior modification, and stress-management practices to manage stress-induced  symptom exacerbations.(4) Maneuvers that resolve pelvic, abdominal, and/or hip muscular trigger points, lengthen muscle contractures, and release painful scars and other connective tissue restrictions should be offered.(4)Pelvic-floor  strengthening exercises (e.g., Kegel exercises) should be avoided(4)",
            "Myofascial physical therapy has been reported to have potential benefit for women with IC(3) \u2013Authors of a U.S. multicenter RCT compared pelvic floor myofascial physical therapy to global therapeutic massage(3) -Eighty-one  women with similar symptoms at baseline, of less than 3 years\u2019 duration, were randomized to the 2 treatment groups -Participants had demonstrable pelvic-floor  tenderness on physical examination -Primary outcome was response on a 7-point  global assessment scale. Secondary outcomes included pain, urgency, and frequency -Myofascial physical therapy consisted of targeted internal and external tissue manipulation, focusing on the muscles and connective tissue of the pelvic floor, hip girdle, and abdomen. Global therapeutic massage was a full-body-massage program -Nearly 60% of the women receiving myofascial physical therapy experienced moderate or marked improvement in overall symptoms, compared to only 26% of the global therapeutic massage group  -Lack of follow-up  prevented any conclusions about the durability of the response to this therapy beyond the 12-week treatment program \u2013Authors of a narrative review of physical therapy interventions in IC came to the following conclusions:(14) -Physiotherapy can improve patient care through bladder training techniques along with stress reduction methods. In addition, certain types of manual techniques, when administered by an experienced physiotherapist, may alleviate symptoms \u2013Use of modalities for pain (local heat, cold packs, TENS), biofeedback bladder retraining,(2) and guided imagery(2) have been reported to help alleviate symptoms of IC. Gentle exercises such as low-impact  aerobics, walking, yoga, and swimming may be useful in reducing symptoms(1) \u2013There is a void in the literature of RCTs on the effectiveness of therapy for IC(8) -In a U.S. study, 1,982 subjects with IC completed a survey on the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies -84.2% reported trying diet or physical therapy; 69.2% reported trying other therapies. Of 49 possible CAM therapies, 22 were rated as having a positive effect, 20 were rated as having a negative effect, and 7 were rated as inconclusive -Therapies perceived as helpful were dietary management, pain management, physical therapy, stress reduction, acupuncture, exercise, sleep hygiene, heat, cold, meditation, and relaxation -Subjects with acute cases reported better effects of therapies compared to those with a chronic history of IC .
