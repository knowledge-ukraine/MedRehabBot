        "title": "Language Disorders  Toddlers -interventions lasting longer than 8 weeks might be more effective than shorter interventions -intervention for children with expressive language difficulties only might be more effective than therapy for children with combined receptive-expressive  language difficulties (however, many studies exclude children with receptive language difficulties, so the results are inconclusive) \u2022AAC: The goal of AAC for a toddler with a language disorder is to increase total vocabulary (with spoken and augmented words combined), increase opportunities for communication exchanges, and improve the overall effectiveness of communication \u2013In a study conducted in the United States, researchers randomly assigned 62 toddlers (mean chronological age of 29.60 months) with both developmental and language delays to one of three different parent-coached  intervention groups(24) -Augmented communication input (AC-I):  intervention focused on language input from the parent who used AAC(24) -Augmented communication output (AC-O):  intervention focused on the child\u2019s language production abilities using AAC(24) -Both AC interventions utilized commercially available speech generating devices (SGDs) that were modestly priced and used the method of direct selection(24) -Spoken communication (SC) interaction: intervention focused on verbal communication skills without the use of any augmented communication(24) \u2013All children included in the study scored within normal limits on hearing and vision assessments(24) \u2013All intervention groups were 24 sessions in length (18 occurred in the laboratory setting, final 6 sessions in the home); each session was 30 minutes long(24) -The goals of all of the different interventions were to: -increase the child\u2019s use of 10 targeted vocabulary words -coach the parents to conduct the sessions independently at home -train the parent and child in the specific mode of communication (augmented or speech only) -Parents received a protocol manual with weekly goals for the parent, the child, and the interventionist (a non-SLP clinician who carried out the treatment plan with the child) -For the first 8 sessions the parent, along with an SLP who provided real-time  education about the nature of the child\u2019s communicative interactions, observed the interventionist with the child -The parent was introduced to the sessions in the 9th session and increased the time of participation each session until the last 6 sessions were completely parent-led  and conducted in the home of the child \u2013At the conclusion of the study: -expressive vocabulary size was the largest for the AC-O  group and smallest for the SC group(24) -children in the AC-I  and AC-O  groups produced more spoken target words than the children in the SC group(24) -children in the AC-I  and AC-O  groups maintained the gains they had made in the initial 18 sessions of therapy with a trained interventionist across the final 6 sessions that were 100% parent-coached(24) \u2013Researchers noted that this study supported conclusions of previous studies indicating that use of AAC does not hinder development of spoken language in children with developmental and language delays(24) \u2022Parent-training  intervention approaches \u2013Several language intervention programs have been designed with the goal of having parents serve as the primary interventionist in order to improve generalization of newly acquired language skills, incorporate the family into therapy, and address language and pragmatic skills simultaneously(4) \u2013Although research supports the effectiveness of training parents to provide intervention services, there is some question as to whether parent-led  intervention is more effective and which parents/families benefit most from this type of intervention(19) \u2013In a study conducted in the United Kingdom involving 37 children between the ages of 2 years 6 months and 3 years 6 months with moderate-severe  language impairments and their parents, researchers compared the effects of training parents to provide direct intervention (using the Hanen Parent Programme) and the effects of clinic-based intervention (in which parents attended therapy sessions but interactions occurred primarily between the clinician and child). The Hanen Parent Programme includes a combination of parent group meetings and individual therapy sessions with the parent    and child. Parents are taught to become more responsive to their child\u2019s communication attempts through observing their child, waiting and listening to the child\u2019s communication, and following the child\u2019s lead.(25) Researchers found no statistically significant difference in mean child language scores between the two treatment groups either prior to therapy, 6 months after therapy was completed, or 12 months after therapy was completed. The majority of children in both groups improved their language performance over the course of the study. Interestingly, parents from both treatment groups displayed changes in the dynamics of parent-child  interactions (e.g., use of expansions and imitations, equal ratio of parent-child  utterances), but there was no significant difference between groups. The children and parents involved in the Hanen Parent Programme received intervention that was twice as intensive as those receiving clinic-based  therapy. Therefore, resource allocation should be considered when making treatment plans(26) \u2013In a study conducted in the United States, researchers randomly assigned 53 pairs of parents and toddlers (mean chronological age of 30 months) with both developmental and language delays to one of three different intervention groups(27) -Prior to the intervention phase of the study, researchers asked the parents to complete a parent perception of language development measure -The three intervention groups were AC-I,  AC-O,  and SC interventions (described above) -All intervention groups were 24 sessions in length (18 occurred in the laboratory setting, final 6 sessions in the home); each session was 30 minutes long -The goal of all of the interventions was to increase the child\u2019s use of 10 targeted vocabulary words -Parents received a protocol manual with weekly goals for the parent, the child, and the interventionist -For the first 8 sessions the parent, along with an SLP who provided real-time  education about the nature of the child\u2019s communicative interactions, observed the interventionist with the child -The parent was introduced to the sessions in the 9th session and increased the time of participation each session until the last 6 sessions were completely parent-led  and conducted in the home of the child -After the intervention phase of the study, the parents were asked to complete the parent perception of language development measure again -Following the intervention phase of the study, the parents\u2019 perceptions about how to successfully communicate with their children were more positive; however, the change did not reach a level of statistical significance(27) -The parents\u2019 perceptions of the severity of their child\u2019s language difficulty decreased for both groups that used augmented communication (AC-I  and AC-O)  but increased for the group that used only spoken communication -Researchers concluded that the use of AAC, regardless of the type, might be as beneficial to the child for communication as it is to the parent in terms of perceptions of the child\u2019s success with language development \u2013Because parent-child  interaction training is widely used to improve language abilities in toddlers with language delay, but the evidence is lacking, researchers in the United Kingdom conducted a study with 18 parent/child dyads to investigate the effectiveness of a parent-child  interaction training intervention for improving language abilities in the children. The average child age was 29.6 months and the range was 1 year 9 months to 3 years 6 months. The intervention program consisted of 4 weeks of hour-long, clinic-based  sessions, 5 weeks of home-based  practice sessions without a therapist present, and a final session in which speech and language skills were reassessed and outcomes were discussed with the child\u2019s parents. During the first clinic session the parent and child were videotaped and the therapist reviewed the video with the parent to teach the parent about different interaction strategies that can improve child language skills. Throughout the rest of the clinic-based  sessions therapists trained and cued parents in strategy use, and during the home-based  sessions parents were instructed to practice and generalize use of strategies. Outcome measures were parent rating score, child\u2019s MLU, and ratio of child to parent speech. At the conclusion of the study, all three measurements improved significantly, each with a large effect size. Researchers concluded that this study was a promising start towards establishing efficacy and recommended further, larger-scale studies on parent-child  interaction training(43) \u2022RE \u2013In RE, parents/caregivers are taught to:(22) -recognize nonverbal communication attempts from their child -respond to their child\u2019s nonverbal communication in meaningful ways in order to provide positive reinforcement for the child\u2019s efforts -teach their child more conventional and complex ways of communicating \u2022PMT \u2013Milieu teaching (MT): Features of milieu teaching include following the child\u2019s attentional lead and establishing joint attention; using teaching episodes that are brief, positive, and rewarding and that are included within natural activities    that occur throughout the child\u2019s day; simultaneous teaching of form (syntax), content (vocabulary), and function (pragmatics); targeting general communication forms and function that are on the boundary of the child\u2019s productive communicative competence; and using mands (requests), questions, and models to elicit production of targets that are related to the child\u2019s focus of attention.(48) MT often is described in the literature as an intervention for children with developmental delay and disabilities; however, the exact intervention protocols, including frequency and length of sessions, are not well-defined.  The effectiveness of MT for improving communication abilities in children with developmental delay is unknown. In a 2012 What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) Intervention Report published by the United States Department of Education, many studies on MT were found in the literature; however, only one study from 1991 met the WWC standards to be included as part of the Intervention Report. According to this study, there was no apparent effect of MT on communication abilities.(48) Additional, well-designed  studies are necessary to determine the effectiveness of MT \u2013The purpose of PMT is to facilitate emergence of intentional communication and prelinguistic skills such as vocalization and gesture in children with intellectual disability and/or severe language delays. The components of intervention are very similar to those of MT. PMT has been used with children to increase their initiation of joint attention, to make requests, to make requests clearer, and to increase nonverbal and vocal commenting. PMT can also be used with children who have limited communication to expand the language forms and functions they express. While research has indicated that not all children benefit equally, there is some evidence that participants demonstrate more child-initiated  comments and requests as well as imitations and increased vocabulary following interventions(49) \u2013In PMT, clinicians provide direct intervention to children with language delays in a play-based  setting(22) \u2013Children are taught:(22) -to use alternating eye gaze to communicate more effectively (e.g., shifting his or her eye gaze from an object of interest to the communication partner) -to couple gestures and vocalizations with these shifts in eye gaze to increase clarity of communication \u2013Key components include:(22) -paying attention to the child\u2019s object of interest and attention -building social play routines (e.g., rolling a ball back and forth to establish turn-taking) -using prompts, such as time delay (e.g., holding up a bubble wand but not blowing bubbles until the child requests them) -providing natural consequences to the child\u2019s communication (e.g., bubbles are blown when child makes an appropriate request) \u2013In a study conducted in the United States involving 58 children with developmental delays between the ages of 17 months and 32 months and one of their parents, researchers determined that treatment outcome is affected by parental characteristics (pretreatment maternal responsivity and education level)(21) -Children were randomly assigned to either a prelinguistic milieu teaching (PMT) group or a modified responsive small group (RSG) -PMT involved establishing play routines, using communication prompts to elicit requests for objects or actions, and modeling -Modified RSG involved small-group  therapy in which the clinician responded to children\u2019s communication without making any demands on the children. Clinicians did not imitate the children\u2019s motor or nonword vocal behavior -Results showed that children with mothers who had high pretreatment scores of responsivity and high levels of formal education benefited the most from PMT treatment, while children with mothers with low responsivity scores and lower levels of formal education benefited the most from modified RSG -Other published research has found no interaction between maternal education and the effects of responsivity education(RE)/PMT(22) \u2013In a published research study conducted in the United States involving 51 children aged 24\u201333  months with developmental disabilities, researchers examined the longitudinal effects of a 6-month  course of responsivity education(RE)/PMT on the children\u2019s communication and language development(22) -Although previous research indicated increases in the use of intentional communication 6 months after implementing this treatment approach, the current study did not find any effects of treatment at 6 and 12 months after initial treatment(23) -In conclusion, the study\u2019s authors suggest that this intervention technique might be effective in the short term; however, no long-term  benefits have been established    \u2022Language and Play Everyday (LAPE): a parent education program developed by researchers in the United States. In a study conducted by the researchers who developed LAPE, 13 parent-toddler  dyads participated in the program. Each of the toddlers had expressive communication delays. All 13 parent-toddler  dyads participated in the intervention program over the course of 1 year; however, only 8 pairs finished all of the necessary sessions and assessments needed to be included in the data analysis. The LAPE program involved both group and individual sessions. The goal of the sessions was to train parents to use naturalistic language teaching strategies with their toddlers (e.g., wait and respond; repeat and add; environmental arrangement). Parents were also instructed to practice the strategies outside of the sessions for 15 minutes per day during play and routine activities. At the conclusion of the study, researchers found that all of the children included for data analysis increased their expressive vocabulary immediately after LAPE and at a 3-month  follow-up.  The extent of the increase varied by diagnosis: 2 children with specific expressive language delay increased by the most (501\u2013502 words) and the 4 children with developmental delay increased by the least (33\u2013194  words; average of 130). MLU for the group increased from an average of 0.9 during play and 1.0 during routines to 1.7 for play and 1.5 for routines (typically developing toddlers\u2019 MLU ranged from 1.8 to 3.1)(37) \u2022Combined RE/PMT: Techniques of both RE and PMT are combined in an effort to facilitate communication by making changes in both the child\u2019s communication and the responsivity of the child\u2019s environment (i.e., parent/caregiver). The goal is to create a self-perpetuating  transactional cycle based on the premise that parents/caregivers are more likely to respond to clear communication from their child and such responses teach the child to communicate more clearly(22) \u2022Focused stimulation: In focused stimulation, treatment is provided in the format of natural conversation. The SLP or parent/ caregiver provides multiple models of the language target (e.g., two-word combinations) but does not require the child to produce the target. Although the child is not required to produce targeted structures, the environment is manipulated to encourage productions by the child(28) \u2022Imitation therapy: Around 12 months of age, typically developing children begin to watch and imitate the communicative actions of the adults around them.(29) Simple communicative gestures such as pointing allow the child to engage in joint attention with an adult and language develops naturally.(29) There is substantial evidence to suggest that lack of joint attention and/or imitative behaviors in young children contributes to delayed language acquisition.(29) Imitation therapy is an intervention technique based on the idea that improved imitation ability and joint attention in a child with delayed language skills will promote language acquisition(29) \u2013Imitation therapy consists of four distinct stages: (29) -Initially, the SLP imitates all of the child\u2019s actions and verbalizations exactly until the child is able to realize that he or she is controlling the actions of the SLP -Next, the SLP imitates most of the child\u2019s actions and verbalizations, but begins to have the child imitate for short periods of time -At the next stage of imitation therapy, the SLP is the only imitator once again; however, the SLP imitates only the child\u2019s speech behavior involving phonation and movements involving the face and/or articulators -Finally, the SLP and child alternate imitating each other\u2019s speech/voice and movements of the face and articulators \u2013In a study conducted in the United States, researchers examined the effect of imitation therapy on the language skills of 5 children aged 18\u201320  months of age who were identified as minimally imitative and scored below the second percentile on a formal measure of language(29) -Each of the 5 children participated in one-on-one sessions with an SLP or an SLP graduate clinician; the clinicians followed the same protocol according to the four stages of imitation therapy -All children participated in 16 to 18 sessions, each 50 minutes long -Imitation therapy was discontinued when the child spontaneously imitated verbalizations of the clinician at least 8 times across two consecutive sessions -Prior to the study, all 5 children were minimally verbal and scores on the Preschool Language Scale (PLS) were in either the 1st or 2nd percentile -At the conclusion of the study: -All 5 children acquired at least 19 new phonemes over the course of the intervention -All 5 children met the goal of spontaneous imitation of adult behaviors -All 5 children were beginning to pair phonetically consistent forms of CV or CVCV syllables with a meaningful gesture (e.g., saying \u201cbye-bye\u201d  while gesturing with a toy phone) -The PLS was not repeated at the conclusion of the study    \u2022Specific intervention strategies: Paul (2007) recommends the following techniques to address goals in specific language domains: (4) \u2013Improve child\u2019s ability to engage in symbolic play and use gesture to communicate -Early forms of conventional and symbolic play and gestures are modeled by the parent/caregiver and/or clinician -Child is provided with toys that promote symbolic play, such as bottle, bed, spoon, cup, comb -Pretend play scripts involving daily routines (e.g., getting ready for bed) are modeled by the parent/caregiver and/or clinician \u2013Improve child\u2019s use of intentional communication -Initially any form of intentional communication (e.g., eye gaze, gesture) is accepted and responded to by parent/ caregiver and/or clinician. Gradually, expectations are increased so that a response/feedback is withheld until vocalizations and words are produced -Set up communication temptations: The parent or clinician structures the situation and provides models and opportunities for the child to communicate. Clinician and parent/caregiver might model expected response in front of child -Playfully violate known routines in order to elicit a protest or correction from the child (e.g., while rolling a ball back and forth with the child, withhold the ball during the child\u2019s turn) \u2013Improve receptive language skills -Indirect language stimulation (ILS) -Clinician and/or parent/guardian uses expansion, extension, recast, and open-ended  and verbal reflective questions when interacting with the child -One-word  labels are provided for whatever the child is focusing on or referring to with preverbal communication \u2013Improve expressive language skills -Focus on expanding the repertoire of sounds and syllable shapes the child produces rather than on correcting errors relative to adult target words -To increase expressive vocabulary -When choosing words to teach, consider typical language development so that goals include the production of nouns, pronouns, function words, verbs, relational words, and socially useful words -Consider whether the words being taught match the child\u2019s phonological system (i.e., is child able to produce the sounds in the target vocabulary?) -To increase the use of word combinations -When the child produces a one-word  utterance, the adult expands it into a two-word  utterance but does not expect the child to repeat the longer utterance -Clinician and/or parent/caregiver imitates the child\u2019s two-word  productions as reinforcement .

Observing a child\u2019s use of gesture can provide information on his or her ability to regulate social interactions, display signs of affection, and request activities or objects.(3) However, the SLP must be aware of typical ways in which gesture is used in the child\u2019s family, since representational gestures (gestures that establish reference and convey semantic content) in particular have been found to be reflective of a family\u2019s cultural beliefs and influenced by parental/caregiver modeling(15)A child\u2019s speech production can be assessed through either direct observation or a combination of observation, parental report, and speech sample analysis. A child\u2019s vocalizations can be compared to developmental checklists to determine whether or not the child\u2019s vocalizations are age appropriate.(4) Questions to consider when assessing toddler -What is the child\u2019s phonetic inventory of vowels and consonants? -Does the child produce a limited number of syllable shapes in word production and in nonverbal vocalizations?Childhood Apraxia of Speech , referenced above; Clinical Review\u2026Phonological , referenced above; Clinical Review\u2026Speech Sound DisordersArticulation, Functional , referenced above \u2013LanguageLanguage skills might be assessed using formal measures or informal observations. Although parents might report strong language comprehension skills, it is important for the SLP to discriminate between a child\u2019s ability to comprehend language versus a child\u2019s ability to use nonverbal cues (e.g., gestures, eye gaze, context) to aid in following instructions and responding to a speaker appropriately.(4) Questions to consider when evaluating  -Does the child understand words without nonlinguistic/nonverbal cues? What words does the child understand without nonverbal support? Does the child consistently display an understanding of a variety of nouns and verbs?(4) -Does the child understand semantic relation, such as action-object  (e.g., throw the ball)? Does the child understand this relationship even when unexpected vocabulary is used (e.g., kiss the book)?(4) -Does the child understand agent-action-object sentences and commands (e.g., the baby drank the milk) even when unexpected vocabulary is used?(4)Language skills might be assessed using formal measures (e.g., standardized tests, parent-completed  questionnaires, and language sampling) or informal observations. Questions to consider when -How is the toddler communicating (communicative means/communicative form), what types of messages is he or she communicating (communicative function), and how frequently is the child using intentional communication?(3,4) -Measures of expressive language for toddlers include mean length of utterance (MLU), Index of Productive Syntax (IPSyn), and the Test of Early Grammatical Impairment (TEGI); for each of these measures there are norms for children ages 18 to 36 months and they can be used to measure developing syntax and grammar(41) -Could the child\u2019s limited expressive language be the result of an underlying motor speech disorder? Is there a history of delays in babbling and/or problems with feeding?(4) -What is the size and range of vocabulary used expressively by the toddler? What semantic classes are represented in the child\u2019s expressive vocabulary?(4) -If the child has an expressive vocabulary of 50 words or more, has he or she begun to combine words (e.g., \u201cBobby ball\u201d)? If the toddler has begun to combine words, how frequently does he or she use word combinations and what meanings are they used to convey (e.g., possession)?(4)Pragmatics includes the social use of language and the often implicit rules that dictate the ways language is used to communicate.(3) The three levels of pragmatics are intentions (why a child communicates), conversational discourse (turn-taking, topic-changing  rules), and role taking (the ability to take the listener\u2019s perspective during conversation).(3) Strong pragmatic skills are essential to being able to engage socially and linguistically, while weak pragmatic skills might indicate the risk of or presence of a language disorder. Parent report might be an especially useful means of assessing pragmatic skills, as parents are able to observe their child\u2019s skills in a variety of settings(16)Assess vocal function, including vocal quality, loudness, pitch, and endurance; if there are specific concerns regarding voice, refer to otolaryngologist for complete workup to rule out laryngeal pathologies prior to completing a full",
