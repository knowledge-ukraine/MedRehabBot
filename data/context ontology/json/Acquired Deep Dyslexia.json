For example, one subject used his wife\u2019s name (\u201cCarole\u201d) to link the /k/ sound to the letter \u201cc.\u201d After practice associating the link word with the grapheme, the patient is then taught to produce the initial phoneme alone and then sound out each letter of the word. Results of a study conducted in the United Kingdom indicated that a subject with deep dyslexia was able to learn how to read simple words and to improve oral naming ability by self-cueing  by producing the initial sound of the word.(38) However, this subject and subjects in two other studies had difficulty blending phonemes into syllables and words(3) \u2013Grapheme-to-phoneme  and bigraphs/syllables:  The Wilson Reading System, a reading approach that trains GPC and blending, was trialed in one patient with deep dyslexia.(39) Syllable shapes (consonant-vowel-consonant  [CVC]) were taught in conjunction with individual letter sounds. A multiple-baseline  design using control and treatment probes was used to evaluate treatment effects. The subject was trained only on CVC syllabic structure and was able to reacquire blending skills for CVC words but not for other structures. In addition, there was a reduction in semantic errors. Results suggest that improvement was directly related to treatment but that generalization to untrained syllable structures did not occur(39) \u2013In a study conducted in the United States, researchers examined the effectiveness of a similar bigraph approach (training of CV and VC shapes). Results indicated that two subjects with deep dyslexia were able to blend trained bigraphs to read trained and untrained words. Results did not generalize to untrained bigraphs.(33) Results of a later case study with a patient with Broca\u2019s aphasia and deep dyslexia also indicated that the bigraph approach improved reading accuracy and comprehension. In addition, the approach improved reading of low-imageability words(40) \u2013In a case study involving a 38-year-old  Spanish-speaking female patient with deep dyslexia following resection of a left hemisphere brain tumor, an SLP trained simple CV and CVC and V-only  syllables to improve reading skills(23) -Additional therapy techniques included exercises aimed at increasing phonological awareness, improving word reading, and developing word-semantic correspondences(23) -Following 2 years of therapy for 30 minutes 3 times per week, the patient recovered near-normal  reading skills with improved, but still impaired, reading of nonwords(23) ",
            "Semantically based approaches \u2013Lexical priming:  Lexical priming trains the patient to recognize the written form of a word by associating it with its picture. In a case study, a subject with deep dyslexia was presented with an index card with the word written on one side and the picture and the word on the other (10\u201315  words per session).(2) The SLP read the word and the subject was encouraged to construct a mental association between the word and its image. Between sessions, the subject was required to read the words twice a day. Post-test  and follow-up  sessions indicated that the patient was able to read treatment words more correctly than the control (untreated) words(2)",
            "Instruction for increasing reading fluency and comprehension \u2013Oral Reading for Language in Aphasia (ORLA):  ORLA involves the patient repeatedly reading aloud sentences and short paragraphs, first in unison with the clinician and then independently.(3) The approach is based upon learning principles, including active participation by the learner, repetitive practice, over-learning  of skills, use of meaningful materials, and opportunities for success. Authors of a case study of a patient with deep dyslexia examined the effects of ORLA on oral reading ability. The treatment included a total of 24 one-hour  sessions over 7 weeks. Results indicated the ORLA was effective in improving oral reading of trained sentences, and improvements in reading comprehension were seen in subtests of the WAB and the RCBA-2(3) . Problem Goal Intervention Expected Progression Home Program Deep dyslexia Increase understanding of rule-based spelling to assist in word readingGPC _ Provide systematic instruction of GPC rules. Patients practice specific rules to assist them in decoding unfamiliar words (e.g., \u201cc\u201d before \u201ca,\u201d \u201co\u201d and \u201cu\u201d is pronounced /k/). Effects of this approach are mixed due to difficulties in blending phonemes(30,36) _ _ See Treatment summary , aboveSLP introduces each rule individually and provides opportunities for the patient to practice the new rule; once the rule is mastered at accepted level (generally 80% or higher), another rule will be introduced and practiced until mastery is achievedLearning GPC rules can be practiced at home  Deep dyslexia Increase ability to sound out wordsLink-word technique _ Patient can be taught to use his or her own link word for every letter of the alphabet. For example, a patient can use a friend\u2019s name (e.g., \u201cBen\u201d) to link the beginning sound (/ b/) to the specific letter \u201cb\u201d(38) _ _ Patient will: 1) associate a link word with each sound, 2) produce the link word after seeing the letter, 3) produce the sound (without the link word) after seeing the letter, 4) blend sounds together to produce simple words(38) _ _ Results of studies have indicated mixed success in blending phonemes(3) _ _ See Treatment summary , aboveAfter practice associating the link word with the grapheme, the patient is then taught to produce the initial phoneme alone and then sound out the word. Another objective may be to increase the patient\u2019s ability to self-cue by writing the word and then producing the initial phoneme (effective for patients with better written than spoken naming skills)(38)Patient can practice sound-word associations at home with assistance  Deep dyslexia Increase ability to sound out words by learning GPC and syllable shapesGrapheme-to- phoneme and bigraphs/syllables _ The Wilson Reading System is an adolescent/adult reading program that focuses on improving the use of GPC through learning bigraphs and syllables, as well as improving blending and phonological awareness using multisensory presentation and hierarchical instruction. This program is distinguished from other GPC programs in that it specifically trains recognition of syllables and syllable shapes. Case studies using a bigraph/ syllable training approach suggest that this approach assists individuals with deep dyslexia in reducing semantic errors in oral reading and improve accuracy of oral reading for the targeted syllable structure(33,39) _ _ See Treatment summary , aboveThe Wilson Program indicates a hierarchy of treatment with specific consonants, vowels, and syllable shapes. The criteria for introduction of new phonemes is 90% accuracy(39)Patient can practice GPC and syllable shapes at home with assistance  Deep dyslexia Increase ability to read specific wordsLexical priming _ Lexical priming trains the patient to recognize the written form of a word by associating it with its picture.

The SLP reads the word and patient is encouraged to construct a mental association between the word and its image. Between sessions, the patient should practice reading the words twice a day(2) _ _ See Treatment summary , above1.
