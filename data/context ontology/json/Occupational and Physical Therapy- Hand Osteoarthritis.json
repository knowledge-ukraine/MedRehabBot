            "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a progressive and degenerative joint disease. It is the most common cause of joint impairment in persons over age 50 and increases in prevalence with age.(1,6) There is X-ray  evidence of some OA in nearly all persons over age 65, even if not clinically evident(1,6)",
            "OA is characterized by the loss of articular cartilage and reactive changes in the joint margins and the subchondral bone.(1) It is a spectrum of disease, caused by a combination of genetic, metabolic, mechanical, and biochemical factors that impact the joint and surrounding tissue(5)",
