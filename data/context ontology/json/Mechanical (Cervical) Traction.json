            "Traction is the application of tensile forces to the long axis of the spine.(1) Cervical traction is a conservative treatment for neck pain and symptoms associated with mechanical neck pathology such as disc herniation or muscle spasm. Traction may be applied mechanically or manually. Mechanical cervical traction generally makes use of a hydraulic or motorized pulley system with weights, as well as a harness or other device to attach to the patient\u2019s head. Pneumatic traction units are also available. Manual traction is a manual therapy technique in which the therapist uses his/her hands to pull a patient\u2019s head in a cephalad direction. This clinical review focuses on mechanical cervical traction"

            "Studies of intermittent cervical traction for cervical radiculopathy suggest that it is beneficial for reducing pain and improving function as an adjunct to other treatment(1) \u2013In a 2014 RCT conducted in the United States involving 86 patients with signs of cervical radiculopathy, the addition of intermittent mechanical traction to exercise resulted in lower disability and pain scores(9) -In this study, the benefits of traction were noted at longer-term  follow-ups  but there was no placebo intervention, so it is hard to rule out the placebo effect -The above study included manual therapy as a component of standard treatment \u2013Results of an RCT comparing manual and mechanical cervical traction in which all patients received mobilization and exercise therapy indicated that mechanical traction was more effective than manual therapy in managing the pain and disability of cervical radiculopathy(18) -Based in Pakistan, this study involved 36 patients -Patients received treatment 3x/week for 6 weeks -Outcome measures were NDI and the numeric pain rating scale",
            "There is no consensus about whether mechanical cervical traction is beneficial for nonspecific neck pain without radiculopathy  \u2013Results of an RCT conducted in India indicate that intermittent mechanical cervical traction provides additional benefits when included along with conventional physiotherapy treatment for mechanical neck pain(10) -Forty patients with mechanical neck pain, defined as pain aggravated by movement, relieved by rest, and not associated with underlying pathology, were randomly assigned to receive conventional physical therapy only or mechanical traction in addition to conventional physical therapy -Conventional physical therapy consisted of ultrasound and isometric neck exercises -Intermittent manual traction was prescribed for 20 minutes with 40-second  hold time, 10-second rest in supine in 15-degree  neck flexion. Pull of traction was 1/10th patient\u2019s body weight -Outcome measures included the NDI, cervical goniometry, and the numeric pain rating scale -Both groups showed improvements in cervical mobility, pain reduction, and disability perception.
