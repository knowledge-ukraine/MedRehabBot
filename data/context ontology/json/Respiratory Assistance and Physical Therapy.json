            "Mechanical ventilation is a method to replace or assist spontaneous breathing when patients are unable to breathe sufficiently on their own. Current practice generally uses positive pressure ventilation to push air or oxygenated air into the trachea and lungs. Positive pressure ventilation can be administered invasively via oral intubation or tracheotomy or noninvasively through the patient\u2019s upper airway using a mask or similar device.

            "The mode of ventilation used depends on the patient\u2019s need. The description of the mode of ventilation refers to the method of inspiratory support and is defined by three components: the control variable (volume or pressure), the breath sequencing (mandatory, triggered, or both), and the targeting scheme (how the ventilator is set to respond to variables such as patient\u2019s lung compliance and airway resistance) ",

            "Diaphragmatic pacing \u2013Authors of a multicenter retrospective review of the use of diaphragmatic pacing in the initial hospitalization after SCI found that early laparoscopic diaphragm mapping and electrode implantation can successfully wean patients with traumatic cervical SCI from ventilator support, and is also diagnostic in that a diaphragm that cannot be stimulated indicates an inability to wean. Early implementation of long-term  ventilator management strategies can then be started(7) -Records of 29 patients with SCI were reviewed -Seven of the 29 patients had nonstimulative diaphragms from either phrenic nerve damage or infarction to the phrenic motor neurons -Sixteen of the remaining 22 patients (72%) were completely free of ventilator support in an average of 10.2 days. Two patients had delayed weans and three had partial weans. One patient elected to have life support withdrawn"

        "treatment summary": [
            "An 8-weekhome-based  physical therapy program that includes progressive resistance training and aerobic interval training was determined to be feasible and safe for a patient who was undergoing home mechanical ventilation treatment and resulted in improvements in ADLs that were maintained for up to 1-year  post treatment(19)",
            "Chest physical therapy: The goals of chest physical therapy in mechanically ventilated patients are to optimize oxygen transport and ventilation-perfusion matching, increase lung volumes, decrease the work of breathing, and enhance secretion clearance \u2013Manual hyperinflation -Manual hyperinflation is a technique used to provide a greater than baseline tidal volume to the lungs to mobilize secretions and re-expand atelectasis \u2013Airway clearance techniques -Might include percussion, vibration, deep breathing, and coughing as indicated -Expiratory rib cage compression can increase expiratory flow; however, there was no clinically relevant improvement in sputum production and respiratory function in patients receiving mechanical ventilation(21) \u2013Researchers in the United Kingdom found that there are significant disparities in treatment outcomes when ventilated patients are treated by non-respiratory on-call  physiotherapists compared to when patients are treated by specialist respiratory physiotherapists(11) -Based on a prospective randomized crossover trial that involved 22 physiotherapists (10 non-respiratory)  and 93 mechanically ventilated children -Children requiring two physiotherapy interventions during a single day were eligible to participate -Patients received one treatment from a non-respiratory  physiotherapist and one from a respiratory physiotherapist in random order -Treatments were individualized to meet patients\u2019 needs and included re-positioning,  manual lung inflations, chest wall vibrations, and endotracheal suction -The main outcome measure was respiratory compliance. Secondary measures included adverse physiological events and clinically important respiratory changes -There were fewer clinically important improvements following non-respiratory  physiotherapists\u2019 treatments compared with respiratory physiotherapists\u2019 treatments -The authors suggest that targeted training strategies or alternative service delivery models should be explored to address the quality of respiratory physiotherapy services during and outside of normal working hours",
            "Physical training/mobility : Overall, there is support for the ability of mobility interventions to improve outcomes in mechanically ventilated patients but limited evidence of techniques and protocols to use(2,3) \u2013Early mobilization -In European and Australian ICUs daily physiotherapy has been a standard of care for a number of years(12) -Researchers in the United Kingdom investigated the effect of a quality-improvement  strategy to promote early and enhanced rehabilitation for mechanically ventilated patients in a large tertiary referral ICU(12) -Baseline data on all patients invasively ventilated for at least 5 days in the previous 12 months (n = 290) were compared with patients ventilated for at least 5 days with the introduction of the ICU rehabilitation team during that time (n = 292) -Introduction of the rehabilitation team was associated with a significant increase in mobility at ICU discharge and significant reductions in ICU length of stay, ventilator days, total hospital length of stay, and in-hospital  mortality -Patients\u2019 ratios of respiratory rate to tidal volume, maximum inspiratory and expiratory pressure, and O 2 saturation were no different in a control group than in a group that was transferred from bed to chair for at least 30 minutes daily for 6 days -In a randomized crossover trial comparing exercise response between passive and active sitting, researchers in the United Kingdom found that sitting on the edge of the bed was associated with a significant increase in VO 2 in comparison to passive chair sitting(13) -Ten ventilated patients receiving physiotherapy in an intensive care unit were randomly allocated to one of two treatments on day one -Transfer to a lateral transfer chair using a slide and then passively moved into an upright seated position -Sitting on the edge of the bed with assistance from lying to upright sitting by treating physiotherapist, support in the sitting position by the therapist, and then return to lying on the bed -Patients received the other treatment on day two  -Outcome measures were VO 2, VCO 2, minute ventilation, mean arterial pressure, and heart rate -Sitting on the edge of the bed was a more metabolically demanding activity than a passive chair transfer in stable mechanically ventilated critically ill patients, which likely reflects the increased demand on the muscles to maintain active sitting -Despite evidence supporting early mobilization, current routine clinical practice patterns do not appear to apply this evidence(8) -In a study conducted in Germany, 116 ICUs provided data for 783 mechanically ventilated patients for a 24-hour period -Overall, only 24% of patients were mobilized out of bed (i.e., sitting on edge of bed or higher level of mobilization) -Perceived barriers to mobilizing patients were cardiovascular instability and deep sedation -Mobilization out of bed was not associated with more complications, and no falls or extubations occurred in mobilized patients \u2013Inspiratory muscle strengthening \u2013Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) -NMES applied to the quadriceps and tibialis anterior muscles of ICU patients on mechanical ventilation resulted in an increase in dorsiflexion AROM in the stimulated limb compared to the unstimulated limb serving as a control in a study conducted in Brazil(9) -In a sham-controlled  pilot trial with blinded outcome assessment, researchers in the United States found that NMES did not significantly improve leg strength at hospital discharge in mechanically ventilated patients(14) -NMES or sham was applied to three bilateral lower extremity muscle groups for 60 minutes daily in the ICU -Providing electrical stimulation to enhance muscle strength is considered a well-tolerated  preventive strategy for improving muscle weakness in patients who receive prolonged mechanical ventilation(20) -Thirty-three  patients participated in this study and were randomized to either the e-stim  group (n = 16) or control group (n = 17) -The e-stim  group received daily 30-minute  sessions for 10 days -Use of TENS on acupuncture points has been shown to decrease pain levels and opioid consumption in intubated patients who are also using a mechanical ventilator(23) \u2013Hydrotherapy -Researchers from the Netherlands report that hydrotherapy appears to be a feasible and safe intervention in selected critically ill ventilated patients(15) -Ventilated patients admitted to the medical, surgical, or thoracic, but not neuro, ICU were eligible for hydrotherapy if they were severely weak (unable to stand upright despite support by physiotherapist) and were able to respond to verbal commands. Exclusion criteria included high ventilator support, large wounds, severe agitation, and some bacterial infections -In a 15-month  period, 25 ICU patients received at least one hydrotherapy session in addition to the regular early-mobilization program -Before hydrotherapy, any central venous and arterial catheters were disconnected and covered with a dressing. During transfer and hydrotherapy, patients were ventilated with a portable ventilator using pressure support mode -For each patient an individualized program was designed, which might include standing, walking, upper extremity movement, and swimming backstroke -No patients reported discomfort or experienced severe oxygen desaturation or hemodynamic instability",
