            "Expressive language disorder signifies an impairment in language production rather than language comprehension, and is a term recognized by the ICD-9  and ICD-10; however, the existence of an expressive disorder in the absence of a receptive language disorder has been questioned by experts(3)",
            "Language impairment/disorder, or language learning disorder, has been used in research studies to describe children who score below the average range on language tests and who have normal nonverbal intelligence quotient (IQ) as well as those who score in the mild intellectual disability range or whose exact IQ score is unknown.(4) The rationale for including children who have mild intellectual disability is based on evidence that these children perform similarly in language therapy to those who score within the normal range and that many children are identified as having a language impairment without receiving IQ testing(5)",
            "This summary will employ this broader definition, using the term \"LI\" to refer to children who have a language disorder from a very young age as a primary disability and who do not necessarily show a significant discrepancy between language ability and nonverbal IQ. For detailed information on language disorders as a result of secondary disabilities, see Clinical Reviews on hearing loss, vision loss, intellectual disability, childhood aphasia, and traumatic brain injury. A child with LI might have difficulty with one or more aspects of language, including comprehension and expression of complex syntax, semantics, or pragmatics, and often presents with problems in attention, speech perception, working memory, and phonological awareness(4) "

In this sample, all of the children participated in school-based  speech therapy services for LI throughout the school year. Language skills were measured with the CELF-4  (4th edition) and the Picture V ocabulary subtest of the Woodcock-Johnson  Tests of Achievement\u2013III.  Literacy skills (specifically letter/word identification and phonological awareness) were assessed using the Letter-Word Identification subtest of the Woodcock-Johnson  Tests of Achievement\u2013III and with the Catts Deletion task (e.g., \u201cSay mailbox without the mail\u201d). Researchers found that there were four distinct language profiles in this sample of children: low language and literacy skills, average language skills/low PA skills, average language skills/high PA skills, and high language and literacy skills. At the end of the school year, the same four profiles were found in this sample of children; however, over half of the children improved language skills, moving them to a higher language profile group (e.g., a child having average language skills/low PA skills at the start of the school year had average language skills/high PA skills at the end). Researchers found that those children who made improvements came from significantly higher socioeconomic backgrounds, had significantly higher language composite scores, and had a significantly greater number of therapy sessions than did those children whose language profile remained stable over the course of the year(9)"

Several service delivery models are used to deliver language intervention in the U.S. public school system: individual therapy, small-group  therapy, collaboration with the teacher to deliver intervention within the classroom, and consultation with the teacher or teacher\u2019s aide to assist them in delivering language intervention. At this time, there is no evidence to support one method over another; however, it is recognized that language goals should be linked to the curriculum when possible to provide multiple exposures to targeted language concepts (e.g., vocabulary that is specific to content area classes)(4)",
            "Models of service delivery \u2013Classroom-based  vs. pull-out  intervention: Authors of a systematic literature review in the United States compared pull-out  models of language intervention with classroom-based  models of language intervention.(24) Studies included in the review were randomized clinical trials, quasi-experimental  designs, or regression discontinuity designs. Other criteria included participants' age range (2\u20138years) and disability (SLI; receptive and/or expressive language disorder). Only 3 studies met inclusion criteria (91 participants). Fifty-three  of the children received language intervention in a classroom-based  setting. Thirty-eight children received pull-out  intervention in individual or small-group  sessions. Duration of intervention ranged from 3 to 6 months with 1\u20132 treatment sessions weekly. Authors of a systematic review of all 3 studies found that classroom-based  inclusive models in which the SLP and classroom teacher team-taught  the language lessons had an advantage over the pull-out  model and SLP-led  classroom lessons (without collaboration from teacher). Reviewers interpreted these findings with caution due to the lack of studies and the lack of rigorous design features \u2013Indirect language therapy: In a cohort study in the United Kingdom, researchers investigated whether language therapy was equally efficacious when delivered by school staff rather than by SLPs or SLP assistants.(25) Participants were aged 6\u201311  years with a diagnosis of language impairment (N = 38). Teachers met with the research-affiliated SLP before the 4-month  intervention period to discuss individual child language goals and a plan for delivery of language-learning activities. They met again at mid-intervention  to discuss each child's goals and to monitor progress. A language support model was published by the researchers and can be found at https://www.strath.ac.uk/media/faculties/ hass/slt/languagesupportmodel/lsm_doc1_intro.pdf . Outcomes were compared to those of a previous randomized controlled trial in the United Kingdom in which SLPs delivered therapy and the intervention group made significant gains in expressive language as compared to the control group.(26) Results indicated the participants did not make significant gains in expressive language. In addition, fewer language-learning  activities were delivered than in a previous randomized controlled trial in which the program was delivered by SLPs. At present, the more efficacious therapy is that delivered by speech and language therapists or speech and language therapy assistants to children individually or in groups. This might be related to more faithful adherence to the interventions schedule, and to a probably greater amount of language-learning  activity undertaken.(25) Researchers concluded that intervention delivered by the consultancy approach needs to be carefully monitored \u2013Response to Intervention (RTI): The RTI approach is a multi-tiered  framework that involves universal screening to identify students who are at risk for language and reading difficulties, systematic evidence-based  classroom instruction, ongoing progress monitoring, and implementation of effective interventions for students who require more intensive instruction.(27) The first level (Tier 1) of the model involves providing high-quality,  evidence-based  instruction in a general education classroom. All students are screened at the beginning of the school year with a criterion-referenced  or norm-referenced  instrument to determine which students might benefit from additional instruction (e.g., students who fall below the 25th percentile on a screening measure). The second stage of the model (Tier 2) consists of small-group instruction and is directed toward students who continue to have difficulties despite the high-quality intervention. Their responsiveness to more intensive intervention is monitored after relatively short periods of time (e.g., 8 weeks). Tier 3 is provided for students who respond minimally to the second tier intervention and require specialized, more intensive instruction. When students fail to respond or respond minimally to the most intensive tier of instruction (Tier 3), they receive a comprehensive evaluation to determine their eligibility for special education services \u2013Cited advantages of the RTI approach include identification of students with language difficulties before they experience extensive academic failure, decreased numbers of students placed in special education, increased accountability for student performance in general and special education, reduced number of comprehensive evaluations, and increased time for collaboration among school professionals(28) \u2013Multiple research studies on the RTI approach have indicated promising gains for children who receive early, evidence-based  intervention for reading difficulties.(29,30,31) One study has explored using RTI for students with mild speech-sound  disorders; however, there is limited research regarding language intervention for children with LI -The need for early and intensive multi-tiered  intervention programs is proven by scientific literature, showing that the reading difficulties of a large majority of pupils can be prevented if early and intensive interventions are provided. Accumulated literature shows that intense and systematic supplemental interventions are needed to accelerate the reading growth of struggling learners. SLPs can best serve their pupils, and a more general population of at-risk students within their schools, by helping to design and deliver multi-tiered  preventive reading programs from preschool onward(32) -SLPs might work in collaboration with general and special education teachers within an RTI model in roles such as the following: -Collaborating with school professionals to design interventions to improve Tier 1 instruction(32) -Administering progress monitoring measures to determine if the children are meeting benchmarks and to identify those who need additional intervention(32) -Delivering Tier 2 and Tier 3 support for at-risk  students(32) \u2013For detailed information on RTI, see Clinical Review\u2026Response to Intervention (RTI) ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T709175",

The second part of the program includes a small-group  language intervention. In an intervention study in the United Kingdom, researchers investigated the effects of the Let\u2019s Talk Programme delivered by trained education practitioners on expressive and receptive language of 12 children (mean age = 6 years, 9 months) with listening, attention, and expressive language difficulties (according to teacher report). The comparison group was a delayed treatment group that included 12 children who were similarly identified. Treatment sessions were 1/2 hour once a week for 8 weeks. Pre- and postintervention measures included the Bus Story Test, a narrative assessment, and the British Picture V ocabulary Scale (BPVS), a measure of receptive vocabulary. Results indicated that the treatment group had a significant increase in mean length of utterance (MLU) and use of subordinate clauses. The comparison group did not show significant gains in MLU or subordinate clause use. No change in either group was found on a measure of receptive vocabulary",

Authors of a systematic review of language  interventions for elementary school-aged  children concluded that there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions regarding therapy targeted at syntax difficulties.(4) Two Level 2 studies (nonrandomized comparison studies or multiple single-subject  design studies) have shown moderately large to large effects from intervention that employs imitation, modeling, or modeling plus evoked production \u2013Intervention for semantics/vocabulary deficits: Authors of a review of language intervention studies for elementary school-aged  children reported that there is a lack of strong evidence regarding the effectiveness of vocabulary interventions, but that SLPs should have some confidence in interventions that involve collaborating with classroom teachers to provide systematic vocabulary instruction.(4) V ocabulary intervention is particularly important in the early grades to prepare students for more complex reading material in the later grades. Some principles of vocabulary intervention include:(34) -Provide a rich context for students to learn new words. New words should not be encountered in isolation but in contexts that enforce their meaning, such as dialogic reading (clinician or teacher reads while the child actively participates in the book reading experience by answering questions, commenting, and making predictions), hands-on  activities, expository texts, and visuals -Collaborate with the regular and special education teachers to provide students with multiple exposures to new words. Students need opportunities to hear the new word, read it, and use it in speaking and writing. Computerized instruction can also be used to reinforce vocabulary concepts -Teach students to use semantic organizers (visual representations of how words are related to each other) to teach clusters of words and to assist in forming links between words -Teach students independent word-learning  strategies so that they can determine meanings of words they encounter in spoken or written language on their own \u2013Interventions for phonological awareness (PA)/meta-linguistics: Elementary-school-age  students with LI often have difficulty with PA skills. PA skills can be targeted by the SLP or in collaboration with the teacher. Authors of a systematic review found that phonological interventions targeting the skills of rhyming, sound identification, phoneme segmentation, phoneme manipulation, and grapheme-phoneme  correspondence were associated with moderately large to large effects and that these effects were maintained over time.(4) For most children, PA instruction does not need to be long (20 hours or less); however, students with reading disabilities might need additional instruction. PA activities include:(35) -identifying the individual sounds in words. Example: \"What is the first sound in dog?\" (/d/) -recognizing common sounds in different words. Example: \"Tell me the sound that is the same in bike, boy, and bus\" (/b/) -categorizing phonemes. Example: \"Which word does not belong? Dog, dish, bus\" (bus) -phoneme blending. Example: \"What is the word /s/ /k/ /u/ /l/?\" (school) -phoneme deletion. Example: \"What is street without the /s/?\" (treet) -phoneme segmentation: \"How many phonemes in keep?\" (3: /k/ /i/ /p/) \u2013Interventions for pragmatic deficits: Authors of a systematic review of language interventions for elementary-school-aged children found that 2 studies found moderately large to large effects for interventions that included direct instruction on topic initiation and group entry procedures (e.g., how to join a group of children playing a game or with toys).(4) Other pragmatic targets include telling narratives, describing past events, asking questions, requesting help, interpreting people's emotions, taking another's perspective, and maintaining a topic. Activities to address these targets might include:(36) -Storybooks can be used to practice retelling narratives as well as to discuss the characters' actions and intentions for specific social discourse goals -Story structure can be illustrated by examples as well as explicit instruction on narrative components (e.g., introduction, setting, characters). Cue cards with the components can be used to prompt children as they tell or retell narratives -Videos of social interactions can be used to discuss and evaluate others' social discourse -Puppets or role playing can be used to practice social discourse goals -Multiple opportunities should be provided to use behaviors in different contexts to allow for generalization -Narrative intervention: Literature-based  interventions are commonly used to target multiple linguistic goals as well as narration abilities -Contextualized vs. de-contextualized  language intervention: Researchers in the United States explored the relative effects of a contextualized (literature-based)  language invention (CLI), a de-contextualized  language intervention (DLI), and a control group on sentence and discourse-level measures. Sixteen children (aged 6\u20139 years) were randomly assigned to a DLI or CLI group. Eight children from a no-treatment  phase of a separate study acted as a control group. In the CLI condition, children were given opportunities to listen to stories, answer comprehension questions, compare/contrast  characters and stories, discuss and define meanings of words, generate inferences, and solve problems related to the stories. Children in the DLI condition answered questions and played games from commercially packaged language materials. Intervention was delivered by an SLP in small groups (3\u20134 students) in a public school 3 times per week for 6 weeks (50-minute  sessions). Results indicated significant gains on sentence-level  and discourse-level  measures for both treatment groups as compared to the control group. Effect size analysis indicated that the CLI group outperformed the DLI group on all measures. The authors interpret these preliminary results with caution and advise a larger, more internally valid efficacy study to confirm the effects(54) -Explicit instruction of story grammar components: The effects of explicit instruction in story grammar components (setting, initiating event, attempt/action, internal response, consequence, ending) and story organization were investigated in a pilot study of 24 children (aged 6\u20139years) in the United States with specific language learning difficulties.(37)Dependent measures included T-unit  analysis (T-unit  = smallest word group that can be considered a grammatical sentence) and grammar component analysis of stories told by participants pre- and post-intervention.  In addition, a control measure of identification of parts of speech (not addressed in intervention) was administered. The intervention utilized a program entitled  The Expression Connection: A Structured Approach to Teaching Storytelling to School-Age Children .(38)Small-group  intervention was provided for 30 minutes/2 times weekly for 13 weeks. Upon posttest, significant gains were found on mean number of T-units  and developmental story level but not on parts-of-speech  identification measures",
            "Dialogic reading intervention \u2013The effects of dialogic reading (shared book reading in which an adult creates a dialogue with the child) between adults and 5 to 6 year olds on expressive vocabulary and narrative abilities were investigated in a Canadian study of 40 English-speaking  children in kindergarten classrooms with a high concentration of low-income  households.(39) Children were randomly assigned to a dialogic reading treatment group or an alternative treatment group (phoneme awareness program). In a dialogic reading technique described by Whitehurst et al., the adult encourages the child's oral language by using elaborative \"wh-\"  and open-ended questions, repetition of good responses, and expansion of incomplete responses.(40) In this study, \"interveners\" (not described in the study) were taught how to do dialogic reading by watching a video that depicted teachers using dialogic reading prompts, and then were given a standard list of prompts and opportunities to role-play.  Intervention took place over 8 weeks/2 times per week for 20-minute sessions in groups of 1 to 4 children. At posttest, the children in the dialogic reading group produced narratives that were better structured and more appropriately de-contextualized  than the narratives of the children who were in the alternative treatment group. In addition, the narratives of the children in the treatment group included more structural components. The authors report that results should be interpreted with caution due to modest effect sizes and the absence of a variety of narrative types examined in this study \u2013In a phase I/II preliminary clinical trial conducted in the United States that included 27 kindergarten students with SLI, researchers investigated the effects of interactive book reading on word learning. Treatment materials were 10 commercially available, age-appropriate  books with color illustrations. From these books, 60 target words were selected due to the repetition of the words throughout the books. In this study, the children were randomized into four groups with varying treatment intensities: children received either 12, 24, 36, or 48 exposures to each of the target words. Researchers found that word knowledge increased with increasing number of sessions, with a maximum effect reached at 36 sessions. There was no increased performance on outcome measures (definition task and naming task) for the group that received 48 exposures to the words(53)",
            "Intervention for comprehension and auditory processing: \u2013Comprehension monitoring instruction: Comprehension monitoring refers to recognizing and reacting appropriately when one does not understand. Instruction in comprehension monitoring might involve: -teaching good listening skills (sitting still, looking at the speaker, thinking about what the speaker is saying)(41) -teaching children to recognize how messages are hard to follow (too soft, too garbled, confusing, too long)(41) -teaching children how to react when they do not understand (ask a person to repeat the message slowly, ask a person about an unfamiliar word)(41)",
            "Computer-directed  intervention/training in rapid auditory processing: Fast ForWord Language (FFW-L)  is a computer program that was developed with the objective of increasing a child's ability to perceive fast-changing  acoustic input to allow for improvement in overall language ability \u2013In a randomized controlled trial (N = 216; ages 6\u20139 years) in the United States, researchers investigated the efficacy of FFW-L  by comparing 4 treatment interventions, each lasting 1 hour and 40 minutes, 5 days a week for 6 weeks(42)  -FFW-L:  Children played 7 different types of computer games that targeted tone discrimination, detection of individual phonemes, phoneme matching, identifying matched syllable pairs, discrimination between minimal pair words, comprehending grammatical morphemes, and comprehending complex sentence structure(42) -Computer-assisted  language intervention (CALI): Children used 7 computerized instructional models from other educational commercial software during treatment sessions. The modules targeted discrimination and memory of non-speech  sounds, detection of individual phoneme changes, phoneme discrimination, identifying matched syllable pairs, and comprehending grammatical morphemes and complex sentence structures(42) -Individualized language intervention (ILI): Children participated in individualized language therapy provided by an SLP targeting specific language skills related to the topic and content of children's books: semantics, syntax, narration, and PA(42) -Language facilitation strategies used by the SLP included slower speech rate, emphatic stress on target forms, recasts, focused stimulation, incidental teaching, scaffolding, and mediation(42) -Academic enrichment (AE): Children played with computer games targeting mathematics, science, and geography(42) \u2013Participants in all 4 intervention conditions improved significantly from pretest to posttest on global language measures and measures of backward masking(42) \u2013FFW-L  was not more effective than the nonspecific comparison treatment (AE) in improving general language skills(42) \u2013Children in the FFW-L  and CALI interventions made greater gains in PA than the children in the other two groups(42) \u2013The authors hypothesized that successful language intervention might include the following components that were common to all 4 interventions: intensive intervention that requires the child to attend carefully and respond immediately and includes opportunities for socialization with same-ability  peers and attention from positive and caring adults(42) . Problem Goal Intervention Expected Progression Home Program  Difficulty understanding and using correct or complex syntax or morphologyThe child will improve syntax and/or morphology understanding and use (goals might specify particular syntax objectives)Intervention for syntax and morphology difficulties _ Techniques for teaching oral syntax include: _ 1.Modeling the correct syntactic forms repeatedly during activities that stress the use of that form (e.g., book reading activity with a book that repeatedly uses a grammatical structure) 2.Modeling the correct grammatical form and prompting the child to imitate the correct form 3.Modeling the form and providing opportunities for the child to produce the form spontaneously 4.Teaching the correct form explicitly to the child (\"We say \u2018are\u2019 because we are talking about more than one person. They are going to the store.\") 5.Providing written assignments that allow the child to practice the correct syntactic formProgression will depend on the syntactic and morphological forms that the child currently knows and will progress according to developmental expectationsTo generalize the use of specific syntactic forms, it is important to provide activities for the child to do at home with caregivers Word-finding difficulties and low vocabulary levelIncrease the child's vocabularyIntervention for vocabulary deficits _ In a school, the SLP will often work with the regular education or special education teacher to deliver vocabulary instruction.
