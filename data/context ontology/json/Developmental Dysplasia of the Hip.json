            "Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) encompasses a wide range of anatomic abnormalities in which the femoral head and acetabulum grow abnormally or are not aligned correctly, resulting in a subluxed or dislocated femoral head.(1,4) DDH is divided into four categories \u2013Isolated dysplasia: Abnormal development of the proximal femoral head or acetabulum, either in the size or shape \u2013Subluxable: Refers to a femoral head that is not centered within the acetabulum; usually due to ligamentous laxity.(9) The hip joint has increased mobility; however, at rest it is correctly located in the acetabulum \u2013Dislocatable: Manual manipulation (i.e., provocation test) can dislocate the head of the femur from the acetabulum(8) \u2013Dislocation: Refers to a femoral head that is positioned completely outside of the acetabulum. This is not the same as a dislocatable hip, in which the femoral head is easily dislocated but can be reduced during physical exam(9) -Dislocations that occur at 12 weeks\u2019 gestation are termed teratologic, which refers to irreversible malformation resulting in a fixed dislocated position. They are associated with a genetic, developmental, or neuromuscular disorder(1)",
            "The International Hip Dysplasia Institute (IHDI) came out with a new hip dysplasia classification in 2014 as the prior method (Tonnis, mentioned below) relied on the presence of an ossific nucleus, which was not always present in newborns. It is based on radiographic measures and has grades 1 (mild) to grade 4 (severe) and has been shown to be more reliable and accurate(15)",

        "treatment summary": [
            "Abduction therapy: Typically, this intervention will be carried out by a physician, nurse practitioner, or registered nurse. However, some clinics may utilize physical therapists \u2013There are many types of abduction therapy devices, including the Frejka pillow, Craig splint, van Rosen splint, T\u00fcbingen splint,(14) and the Pavlik harness -Turkish researchers conducted a retrospective study to assess the functional outcomes of infants with DDH who were treated with the T\u00fcbingen hip flexion splint(14) -The T\u00fcbingen hip flexion splint allows for reduction of the hip with abduction and flexion while allowing movement at the hip and knee joints. The hips remain abducted and flexed even when the child rolls to the side -The overall treatment period was 17 weeks and median age at the start of treatment was 18 weeks. The median follow-up  period was 13.5 months -Researchers found that treatment was successful in 56/60 hips (93.3%). There were no complications in any of the patients \u2013The goal of abduction therapy is to position the hips in the \u201cfrog-leg\u201d position of hip abduction and flexion, which promotes proper hip development by positioning the head of the femur in the acetabulum \u2013The most common abduction orthosis is the Pavlik harness, which is used to treat a \u201creducible\u201d hip before the age of 6 months (preferably before crawling). The harness should position the hips in 100\u2013110\u00b0  of flexion and 70\u00b0 of hip abduction, with the knees in 90\u00b0 of flexion. The harness should be fitted and adjusted by a physician(1) \u2013Caregiver education(1) -The Pavlik harness should be kept on at all times, even during diapering, during feeding, and while changing the infant\u2019s clothes. However, studies have revealed that most parents will remove the harness at some point in the treatment. It is vital to educate the parents regarding the importance of wearing the harness and how to don the harness correctly. The harness should also be marked so that the parent can reapply the harness in the correct position -A disposable diaper can be placed under each harness to keep the harness clean. Clothes worn over the harness will also help to keep it clean -Check the infant\u2019s skin several times per day, especially around the edges and under the straps, for skin abrasions or irritation. Keep the skin clean and dry. Avoid lotions, powders, and cream under the harness -The infant can be positioned supine or prone, but not on side -During transportation, infants should fit in a regular car seat while wearing the harness without difficulty -Complications: Complications from abduction therapy can occur, most likely due to improper harness application, including avascular necrosis, femoral nerve palsy, knee subluxation, pressure sores, epiphysitis, inferior dislocation of the hip, medial knee instability, and tibial torsion(3) \u2013Clinical practice guidelines on nonoperative management of pediatric DDH in infants up to 6 months of age published by AAOS in 2014 are based on a systematic review of the literature that included 31 studies. The authors concluded there is limited evidence to support either immediate or delayed (2\u20139weeks) brace treatment for hips with a positive instability exam. There is also limited evidence to support serial physical examinations and periodic imaging assessments during brace management(12)",

        "Caregivers and healthcare providers should be aware that children with DDH are at risk for developing psychosocial impairments as they age due to the long-term  sequelae. Children report anxiety, depression, and poor self-esteem  and self-image  compared to their peers. During routine follow-ups,  children should be screened for early identification(10)",
