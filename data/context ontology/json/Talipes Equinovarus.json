            "Authors of a synthesis of previous research on treatment-seeking factors for clubfoot in middle-  and low-income  countries identified the following barriers to treatment(20) \u2013Intrapersonal barriers: lack of income; additional responsibilities; guardian\u2019s belief regarding cause of clubfoot; support of fathers, extended family, and community \u2013Institutional barriers: long distances to treatment centers, insufficient information about treatments, and challenges following treatments \u2013Public-policy  barriers: two-tiered  healthcare system makes it difficult for some patients to get timely care",
            "Surgical intervention \u2013Residual equinovarus deformity may follow Ponseti treatment and percutaneous Achilles tenotomy for severe clubfoot. Predictive factors found for residual deformity in 50 retrospective cases included Pirani score, lateral tibiocalcaneal angle, and talocalcaneal angle preceding Ponsetitreatment(9) \u2013Cuboid subtraction osteotomy combined with posteromedial release is an effective surgical approach to manage rigid neglected clubfoot deformity(10) -Based on a study conducted in Italy that included 31 patients (56 feet) older than 5 years -Average follow-up  time was 6 years -Using the Laaveg and Ponseti classifications, 24 feet had excellent correction, 20 feet had good correction, 9 had fair correction, and only 3 had poor correction at 1 year postsurgical repair, with results being maintained up to the patient\u2019s last follow-up -Significant improvements in Dimeglio score were observed following surgical repair"

            "The goal is essentially the same for idiopathic and nonidiopathicclubfoot; i.e., to achieve a plantigrade foot, with or without an Achilles tenotomy",
            "There are two well-established  nonoperative treatment approaches \u2013Ponseti nonsurgical or semi-operative  method(5) -Serial manipulation and long-leg  casting; manipulation in Ponseti method described as gentle stretching of soft tissues(6) -Percutaneous Achilles tenotomy, if necessary to achieve plantigrade foot -DB abduction brace for 3 months at night and during naps for patients aged 2 to 3 years \u2013French PT method(7) -Daily 30-minute  sequence of gentle manipulations during the time the baby is relaxed or asleep after having been fed. These manipulations start with gentle joint tractions, then progressive reduction of each deformity. A major requisite is that the baby never cries during the manipulations and splinting for first 8 weeks -Followed by manipulations and splinting, with interim bracing 3 times weekly",
            "Treatment overview\u2013Ponseti  (11) \u2013Initial treatment varies with age -Serial casting to begin within first month of life, although recent research suggests that it should start between 28 days and 3 months of age(27) -Gentle manipulations and stretching with casting are performed weekly until maximum effect achieved at 5 to 8 weeks -Heel cord lengthening surgery once maximum effect, after which placed in long-leg  cast for 3 weeks -Denis-Brown  abduction device can be used at night for 3 to 5 years -Over 18 months \u2013 bony surgery if soft tissue surgery failed -Over 4 years \u2013 tendon transfers useful, especially if recurrent disease \u2013Useful bony operations include metatarsal osteotomies, calcanealosteotomies, intertarsal fusions",
            "Related research comparing the different methods \u2013The Ponseti method and the French PT method were found to have similar clinical outcomes in a prospective United States cohort study(8) -Two hundred fifty-six  infants with idiopathic clubfoot/clubfeet were assigned to the Ponseti method vs the French physical therapy method based on parental preference -One hundred seventy-six  infants (267 clubfeet) were treated with the Ponseti method -Eighty infants (119 clubfeet) were treated with the French PT method -Outcomes were classified as -Good \u2013 plantigrade foot with or without a heel-cord  tenotomy  -Fair \u2013 plantigrade foot that had or needed to have a limited posterior release, a tibialis anterior tendon transfer, and/or lateral column shortening -Poor \u2013 plantigrade foot that had or needed to have a complete posteromedial surgical release -Mean follow-up  was 4.3 years -Comparing Ponseti method vs the French physical therapy method -Percentage of clubfeet with good outcomes, 72% vs 67% (not significant) -Percentage of clubfeet with fair outcomes, 12% vs 17% (not significant) -Percentage of clubfeet with poor outcomes, 16% vs 16% (not significant) \u2013Gait analysis can provide additional information to assist with determining which nonoperative treatment intervention may be optimal for restoring normalized gait biomechanics \u2013A three-phase  PT program after treatment with the Ponseti method was found to be effective in increasing ROM, functional status, and treatment satisfaction in children with clubfoot(28) -Based on a Turkish study involving 62 patients with unilateral clubfoot -Outcome measures were ROM, one-leg  standing test, sit to stand test, the Oxford Ankle-Foot  Questionnaire for Children and Parent, and treatment satisfaction -The 3-phase  PT program lasted 3 months and consisted of the following: -Phase 1 \u2013rhythmic  and repeated mobilizations to subtalar and talocrural joints, stretching to Achilles and foot invertors and intrinsics, education on home exercise program (plantar fascia relaxation massage, subtalar mobilization, active assistive dorsiflexion and eversion ROM, sensory stimulation to anterior tibialis and peroneus longus) -Phase 2 \u2013 continued mobilizations as in phase 1, kinesiology taping for fibularis longus and brevis muscle, functional exercises (ball exercises, weight bearing) -Phase 3 \u2013 balance and proprioception training, strengthening exercises for tibialis anterior and peroneal muscles \u2013Comparison of plaster of Paris (POP) and semirigid fiberglass (SRF)cast material revealed no significant difference in the number of casts required to correct clubfoot(13) -Based on an RCT conducted in Canada involving 30 patients -SRF resulted in a more favorable parental experience, particularly with respect to ease of removal \u2013Comparison of POP cast material and semirigid soft cast revealed that the soft cast was superior to the POP cast in the areas of parent satisfaction and cast-related complication rates(21) -Based on an RCT conducted in Turkey involving 196 babies (249 feet) -Similar to the above study, no difference was found in number of castings -.
