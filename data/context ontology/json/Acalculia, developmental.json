            "Developmental dyscalculia refers to a range of specific learning disabilities that involve math and occur in individuals with normal levels of intelligence.(1,2,3,4) The prevalence of developmental dyscalculia according to population studies in Israel, the United States, Germany, and India has been reported to range from 3% to 6.5%.(3)Developmental dyscalculia limits a person\u2019s ability to acquire knowledge and understanding of fundamental ideas in mathematics.(2) There is not one type of mathematics disability; clinical presentation of developmental dyscalculia varies considerably from person to person.(1) Additionally, developmental dyscalculiacan affect an individual differently across the different stages of life.(1) When basic math skills are not mastered in elementary school, teens and adults with developmental dyscalculia often have trouble when they are expected to move on to more advanced math that requires the completion of multistep procedures and identification of critical information within a problem(1)",
            "There are two major types of deficits that can contribute to developmental dyscalculia: \u2013Visual-spatial  impairment, which result in the person having difficulty interpreting visual calculations and math problems(1) \u2013Language processing impairment, which result in the person having difficulty processing math concepts or problems presented verbally and trouble comprehending or using the vocabulary of math(1)",
            "Acquired difficulty with concepts of mathematics can occur as the result of an injury, disease, or other pathology of the brain, which is referred to as acalculia.(5) For detailed information on acquired acalculia, see Clinical Review\u2026Acalculia, Acquired ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T709249"

Additionally, researchers found that children with a dual diagnosis of developmental dyscalculia and dyslexia only exhibited inhibition deficits under the word conditions (i.e., not for colors or numbers). The researchers in this study concluded that inhibitory deficits of children with developmental dyscalculia only were more general than those of children with both developmental dyscalculia and dyslexia. These findings support the inhibition deficit hypothesis as a cause of developmental dyscalculia(6) \u2013Does the person have difficulty drawing or copying geometrical figures or difficulty with spatial and temporal orientation?(4) \u2013Does the person have difficulty when asked to perform more than one task at once?

In this study, 15/30 of the children were placed in the experimental group and the other children served as controls. The skills trained during neurocognitive rehabilitation sessions were working memory and mathematic functions. Outcome measures indicated significant improvement in trained skills for the experimental group, but not for the controls. Additional research is warranted with larger study groups(27)",
            "Cognitive-linguistic  interventions for individuals with developmental dyscalculia \u2013Communicate about mathematics in multiple ways(11) -Have the person keep a journal about math to help him or her become comfortable with mathematical vocabulary and concepts(11) -Individuals can write about diverse aspects of mathematics (e.g., feelings, successes, difficulties, fears, the thought process for figuring out a problem, applications for real life)(11) -For some students, it will help to initially explain a new procedure or mathematical concept in writing rather than verbally(11) -Other students might need to discuss mathematical ideas aloud before they attempt to write about them(11) -Individuals can create their own mathematical dictionaries to illustrate new terms; dictionaries can be used as resources to play definition-guessing games(11) \u2013Explain and model new mathematical vocabulary using concrete examples; then have the person explain the concept in his or her own words giving novel examples(11) \u2013When learning new signs and symbols, have the individual discuss how the symbols are alike or different and have him or her develop personal memory tricks to remember them (e.g., the big side of the > symbol faces the bigger number)(11) \u2013Stress meaning of symbols and terms rather than rote memorization;(11) provide informal opportunities to discuss mathematical ideas using correct vocabulary (e.g., how much money is needed to buy a new guitar, how many days of school are left?)(11) \u2013Educate math teachers to avoid unnecessary paralanguage (e.g., \u201cWait to sharpen your pencil\u201d; \u201cPlease sit up straight\u201d) when giving directions or explaining new math concepts(11) \u2013If possible and appropriate for the person, he or she can record lectures, directions, or explanations to listen to again later(11)",

            "MASTER (Mathematics Strategy Training for Educational Remediation) is a program developed for teaching multiplication and division(3) \u2013Teaches the underlying principles of multiplication and division (e.g., that multiplication is repeated addition) and provides alternative strategies for solving math problems (e.g., 7 x 6 could be solved by adding 7 six times or by adding the results of 5 x 6 and 2 x 6)(3) \u2013The rationale for the use of this program for individuals with developmental dyscalculia is that it helps with learning arithmetic by training underlying number concepts and problem-solving  strategies(3)",
            "Treatment concepts for specific problems in mathematics \u2013For persons who have difficulty deciphering the syntactic elements of numbers, they can be trained to transcribe numbers into their corresponding digits(3) -For the number \"51,677,\" the person learns number syntax by separating the number into parts; learning that the \"5\" refers to tens of thousands, the \"1\" to thousands, the \"6\" to hundreds, and so forth(3) \u2013The ability to visualize the concept of \"number line\" can be taught by having the individual do repetitive additions(3)  -Using 10, the repetitions would progress as follows: 4 + 10 = 14, 14 + 10 = 24, 24 + 10 = 34\u2026 \u2013Enhancing automatic recall for number facts through the use of repeated basic math drills(3) -Appropriate for a person who understands number concepts but has difficulty in computation and becomes overwhelmed by the procedures needed to solve an arithmetic exercise(3) -Even basic math skills must be overlearned by an individual with developmental dyscalculia for them to become automatic(11) \u2013Often, individuals with developmental dyscalculia have difficulty with internalizing the concept of numbers; in these cases, individuals should be instructed in basic number concepts rather than rote memorization of number facts(3) -This can be accomplished by using functional, representational systems to facilitate learning (e.g., using a thermometer for the concept of number line)(3) \u2013Another method to promote number concept understanding is to encourage students to verbalize their own perception of an arithmetic procedure so that the teacher can provide feedback(3)",
            "Assistive technology can be beneficial for individuals with developmental dyscalculia \u2013Computer programs for mathematics that emphasize arithmetic drills have the potential to aid in learning rote mathematical facts(3) \u2013Interactive computer or video game programs for acquiring math concepts and problem-solving  skills can be useful; these programs often provide scenarios for everyday situations that are dependent on mathematical thinking (e.g., buying groceries, organizing a schedule)(3) \u2013Calculators are helpful when impaired memory for number facts hinders the ability to correctly complete arithmetic problems(3) \u2013Calendars, programs with alarms, and digital and talking clocks can help persons with time management difficulties(3) .
