            "Hypertension (HTN) is persistent elevated arterial blood pressure (BP) (two or more readings of elevated arterial BP),which can go undetected for years.(1,2) Systolic BP and diastolic BP are typically both elevated, although older adults have increased risk for isolated systolic HTN(1,2)",
            "BP for adults (aged 18 and older) is classified in the following manner by the American Heart Association and the Seventh Joint National Committee (JNC 7): \u2013Normal: systolic BP < 120 mm Hg; diastolic BP < 80 mmHg(1,3) \u2013Prehypertension: systolic BP 120\u2013139  mmHg; diastolic BP 80\u201389 mmHg(1,3) -Prehypertension is not a disease category, but a designation provided to identify those individuals who are at increased risk of developing HTN; these individuals are not candidates for drug therapy and should be advised to practice lifestyle modification to lower risk of HTN(1) \u2013HTN stage 1: systolic BP 140\u2013159  mm Hg; diastolic BP 90\u201399  mm Hg(1,3) \u2013HTN stage 2: systolic BP \u2265 160 mm Hg; diastolic BP \u2265 100 mm Hg(1,3)",
            "Compared with previous HTN guidelines, the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) guidelines published in 2014 have higher BP goals(20) \u2013In patients 60 years or older who do not have diabetes or chronic kidney disease, the goal BP level is now < 150/90 mm Hg \u2013In patients 18 to 59 years of age without major comorbidities, and in patients 60 years or older who have diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or both conditions, the new goal BP level is < 140/90 mm Hg",
            "The difference in the two measures listed above has caused much dissension in the HTN community, with the American Heart Association (AHA) and American College of Cardiology (ACC) not accepting the JNC 8 recommendations(6) \u2013AHA cites a study conducted in the United States that demonstrated that persons aged 60 years and older who achieved a systolic BP < 140 mmHg had significantly better outcomes than persons achieving a systolic BP\u2265140 mmHg(23) \u2013The Working Group on Women\u2019s Cardiovascular Health strongly disagrees with the JNC 8 recommendations to raise the threshold of initiating treatment for older persons, especially because of the effect on women, who are the majority of the older adult population with HTN. They note that the new recommendations put women, especially Black women, at unnecessary excess risk and increase the existing sex and racial/ ethnic cardiovascular disease disparities(27) -This group suggests adhering to a BP goal of < 140/90 for older women ",
            "HTN increases the risk of cardiovascular disease; the higher an individual\u2019s BP, the greater the risk of myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure, stroke, and kidney diseases(1,2)",
            "HTN in women \u2013In the past, being female was thought to be protective against HTN(6) -Systolic BP rise is more steep in aging women compared with men, which may be related to the hormonal changes during menopause(6) \u2013Women are more likely than men to be aware that they have HTN,seek treatment for HTN, and have it controlled(1) -Still, many women do not realize that even though they may have had normal BP throughout their lives until menopause, after menopause the chance of developing HTN increases substantially(21)",
            "HTN in postmenopausal women \u2013HTN that occurs in the early menopausal years is the most important risk factor for coronary heart disease(21) -Nearly half of all adults with HTN are women. At ages 65 and older, women are more likely than men to develop HTN \u2013Menopause and postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy can affect BP in women; however, the exact effects on BP are unknown. Researchers have found that a menopause-related increase in BP can be attributed to several factors, including estrogen withdrawal, overproduction of pituitary hormones, weight gain, and a combination of these factors(1)",
            "HTN and premenopausal women \u2013Women taking oral contraceptives can experience a small but measurable increase in BP; a small percentage of women on oral contraceptives experience the onset of HTN(1) \u2013There is a lack of research on premenopausal women and HTN other than on HTN in pregnancy(24) -Authors comparing the lifetime risks among different groups for development of HTN concluded that the prevalence of BP of 130/80 mmHg or greater is very high in young adulthood(34) \u2013Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy are a significant cause of maternal, fetal, and neonatal morbidity and mortality and require close monitoring by the patient\u2019s physician. HTN during pregnancy is classified into one of five categories: chronic HTN, preeclampsia, chronic HTN with superimposed preeclampsia, gestational HTN, and transient HTN(1,4,5) \u2013Women with chronic HTN can be at risk for severe postpartum HTN (i.e., an emergency room visit, hospital admission, or clinic visit with a diagnosis of BP 160/110 within 8 weeks of delivery)(28) -Based on a retrospective cohort study conducted in the United States of 235 women with chronic HTN, of whom 13% developed severe postpartum HTN -Those with severe postpartum HTN were more likely to have had severe preeclampsia in their recent pregnancy, a slightly higher systolic BP at discharge from the hospital, and to have been discharged on antihypertensive medications -Most cases of severe postpartum HTN occurred within 7\u201310  days of hospital discharge",
