            "Dysphagia refers to difficulty swallowing due to an inability to move food and/or liquid efficiently during the oral, pharyngeal, and/or esophageal phases of swallowing.(7) The oral phase includes sucking, chewing, and moving the food or liquid into the throat. The pharyngeal phase is the initiation of the swallowing reflex, when the food is squeezed down the throat and the airway is closed off to prevent aspiration (food or liquid entering the airway) or choking. In the esophageal phase, the openings at the top and bottom of the esophagus move the food or liquid to the stomach by relaxing and tightening.(8) Symptoms of dysphagia in children with VFP are variable. Most children with VFP present with symptoms in the first 2 years of life. Dysphonia is present in 50% of children with unilateral VFP and feeding difficulties are present in 25%. Feeding difficulties and dysphonia are less common in children with bilateral VFP, with the most common symptoms being stridor and airway management difficulties(9) Causes, Pathogenesis, & Risk Factors"

However, many children with bilateral VFP do not need a tracheotomy, in contrast to adults with bilateral VFP, who almost always need one.(6) For detailed information on treating dysphagia in children withChildren with Tracheostomy , referenced aboveIn arytenoid adduction, the arytenoids are surgically rotated in the position of adduction (closure) and are sutured together in this position(19,20) Injection of material into the vocal folds to allow for medialization (e.g., fat injection, Gelfoam or Teflon injection, absorbable gelatin powder, collagen)(2,19)The purpose of lateralization is to improve the airway by lateralizing one or both of the vocal folds permanently in children with bilateral VFP.(4) Surgical techniques for children might include arytenoidectomy, cordectomy by laser technique, or lateral cervical approach(4)(10,19) Medialization thyroplasty involves the insertion of a silicon implant through an opening in the thyroid cartilage that pushes against the paralyzed vocal fold, allowing it to make contact with the other vocal fold.(21) A modified approach to this type of surgery has been recommended for the pediatric population(22)To restore abductive (opening) capability of the vocal folds, the posterior cricoarytenoid muscles can be reinnervated in cases of bilateral VFP. Reinnervation of the adductors of the larynx in unilateral VFP might be recommended for children with unilateral VFP.(4) In a study conducted in the United States, researchers found that recurrent laryngeal nerve reinnervation surgery was safe and moderately effective in 13 children, all under the age of 10, with unilateral VFP and symptomatic dysphonia and dysphagia(55)",

A flexible laryngoscope uses fiberoptic technology and can be passed through the nose to the back of the throat, allowing for examination of the larynx during voicing; it is commonly used to evaluate young children(46)Videostroboscopic examination allows the examiner to see the vocal folds vibrating in slow motion and provides information on any abnormalities present during voice production (e.g., abnormal closure). It is performed with instrumentation used for oral endoscopy or nasendoscopy and is combined with a strobe light correlated to vocal fold vibration.(46) The examiner can view aspects of vibratory function such as the mucosal wave, vibratory amplitude, periodicity, and symmetry.(20) Vibratory parameters are usually rated on a Likert scale (e.g., 1\u20135)Electroglottography provides information on vocal fold closure by measuring the electrical resistance of two electrodes placed around the neck(46)Ultrasonography is a noninvasive method of examining the larynx and the movement of the arytenoids in infants and children(23)If the child is old enough, identify the voice\u2019s perceptual and acoustic characteristics and the patient\u2019s behavior (e.g., evidence of neck strain) during voicing or voicing attempts(25) -Acoustic measures of voice might include signal-to-noise  ratio, jitter (pitch perturbation), and shimmer (amplitude perturbation)(47) -Respiratory-phonatory  behaviors include measures of maximum phonation time, breath group lengths (number of syllables or words produced on one expiratory flow), and S/Z ratio (the length of time a person can produce \u201cS\u201d over the length of time the person can produce \u201cZ.\u201d A number greater than 1.4 indicates difficulty with easy movement of the vocal folds.

Evaluate specific characteristics of sucking, including the coordination of sucking-swallowing-breathing1 extensor movements, gasping, coughing, and choking(29) -Assess for presence of permanent and temporary reflexes. There are many tools that give average ages for the presence and extinction of oral reflexes (see Assessment scales/checklists , below)(26) -For children -Assessment of oral structures and motor function. Examine the oral structures for any malformations and muscle tone abnormalities. Examine the lips, cheeks, jaw, tongue, and hard and soft palate at rest and during spontaneous movement. Note any palatal or labial clefts, micrognathia, deviant dental occlusion, ankyloglossia, and trismus(26) -Assessment of speech and vocal quality. Examine for presence of hoarseness or stridor(26) -Assessment of feeding and mealtime techniques used by patient and caregivers.(12) When possible, conduct the CSE during a regular feeding time to observe the patient\u2019s skills in coordinating of respiration and swallowing in a natural environment.(12) Assess patient\u2019s ability to achieve labial seal and contain bolus. Examine retrieval of different liquids and/or foods from a nipple, spoon, cup, and straw (as developmentally appropriate). Observe caregivers\u2019 rate of feeding, ability to read child\u2019s cues, and techniques they use to make feeding easier for their childIn-depth  Bedside SwallowT709064There are several clinical assessment scales and checklists to use with infants and children during the CSE; however, there is no universally accepted feeding assessment tool. Scales, surveys, and checklists are commonly used in the CSE but often do not include normative data, standardization, validation, or guidelines for interpretation. SLP knowledge of normal oral motor development and feeding function are essential when evaluating infants and childrenLip, cheek, tongue, and jaw movements are rated during a typical meal. This scale can be used with children from 1 year of age through adulthood(31)A statistically based protocol for patients who are dependent feeders. Scaled ratings are made for posture, tone, reflexes, general motor control, orofacial structures, orofacial sensory input, orofacial motor control, ventilation, and functional feeding assessment(32)Ratings of lip, jaw, and tongue movement during ingestion of liquids and solid foods. Assessment of sipping from a cup, coughing, gagging, and hypersensitivity associated with feeding and swallowing. A checklist allows for indication of abnormal oral structures, oral reflexes, positioning, diet, utensils, and feeding(33)Assessment of oral motor, oral sensory, and oral motor speech abilities in children aged 18 months to 5 years(34)An instrument that assesses oral motor function across a wide range of food textures and fluids for preverbal children(35)Standardized screening survey that can be used with children from 2 years of age through adulthood. Assesses BMI, restrictions in food textures and viscosity, dependence in feeding, and need for special utensils or positioning. Provides information on the severity of the swallowing disorder and can be used as an outcome measure(36)A tool developed to screen for nutrition and swallowing problems in persons with intellectual disabilities. The checklist format allows for caregiver involvement in identifying risks and managing swallowing difficulties(37)A tool to assist the clinician in describing the level of severity (7 levels) of the dysphagia and in making recommendations for nutrition, diet, and independence(38) A VFSS is performed when the dysphagia team has concerns about the pharyngeal phase of swallowing and the complete swallowing sequence. In addition, a VFSS might be ordered by an otolaryngologist to determine the possible benefit of surgical correction.(39) Most clinical practices follow the protocol originally described by Logemann; adaptations of this protocol for infants and children are described by Arvedson and Lefton-Greif.(40,41) The assessment must be age-appropriate  with regard to positioning, presentation, and viscosity of material.(12) The patient eats and drinks a variety of liquids and solids mixed with barium while images are recorded with videofluorography. All patients should be examined in the lateral and frontal positions to gain information on movements of the swallow and symmetry of bolus flow and pharyngeal wall contraction. The SLP examines for the presence and cause of aspiration and the effectiveness of presenting different food consistencies or of modifying posture.(12) In contrast to the BSE, a VFSS provides critical information on the pharyngeal phase of the swallow and is able to detect silent aspiration.(28) Given the unnatural surroundings, swallowing function observed during a VFSS is not necessarily identical to that at mealtimes. Other variables that might influence swallowing function include anxiety, fatigue, and medications.(42) Due to the potential harmful effects of ionizing radiation, a repeat VFSS should only be considered when there are specific questions that require answers from a repeat study; a VFSS should not be used frequently to monitor changes in swallowing. During the(42) -Lip closure (ability to contain a liquid bolus) -Lingual elevation (the back of the tongue is slightly elevated) -Tongue-to-palatal  seal -Bolus preparation/mastication -Bolus transport/movement of the tongue (movement of the bolus to the back of the oral cavity) -Initiation of the pharyngeal swallow (swallow should be initiated when the bolus reaches the region of the posterior oral cavity) -Soft palate elevation and retraction -Laryngeal elevation -Anterior hyoid excursion -Laryngeal closure -Pharyngeal contraction -Pharyngoesophageal segment opening -Tongue base retraction -Epiglottic inversion -Esophageal clearanceModified Barium SwallowT709077FEES is performed to evaluate the anatomy and physiology of the pharynx and the larynx, pharyngeal swallow function, and the patient\u2019s ability to manage secretions and swallow foods and liquids.(12) In addition, it can be used to explore a variety of diagnostic interventions, such as varying bolus consistency, varying posture, or making use of visual feedback for reinforcement.(43) After the insertion of the endoscope, the patient can engage in normal feeding behavior during the evaluation. Food must be light in color to enhance visibility (e.g., milk, puddings, yogurt, bread). FEES is preferred over VFSS when patients have safety issues related to radiation exposure or when they need retesting. The American Speech-Language-Hearing  Association has published several online documents regarding technical aspects of FEES and the qualifications required to perform FEES(44) -For detailed information on FEES and endoscopic examinations for dysphagia, see Clinical Review\u2026Dysphagia",

Trials of different liquid consistencies should be performed with instrumental assessments (i.e., VFSS, FEES). Examples of circumstances in which thickened liquids typically reduce the risk of aspiration include:(17) \u2013Pooling of liquid in the oral cavity \u2013Poor lip closure and loss of liquid \u2013Poor tongue control, movement, and coordination \u2013Delayed initiation of the swallow \u2013Coughing/choking/gulping \u2013Clinical signs of aspiration \u2013Presence of GERD",
