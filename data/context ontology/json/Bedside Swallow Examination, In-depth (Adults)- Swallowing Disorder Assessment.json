If the patient is observed coughing or choking during or immediately after completion of drinking, this is considered a failure of the test and an indication of dysphagia.(27) Authors of a systematic review of bedside screening methods for oropharyngeal dysphagia reported that the 3-oz Water Swallowing Test has excellent sensitivity, but low specificity (i.e., a negative result usually is accurate and the patient does not have dysphagia; however, a positive result/failure of this test does not always necessarily correlate with actual presence of dysphagia)(27) \u2013In a study conducted in the United States with 62 patients with acute stroke, researchers found that spontaneous swallow frequency analysis (SFA) had high potential to identify dysphagia among patients with acute stroke. In this study, all patients were screened for dysphagia according to the hospital\u2019s stroke assessment protocol. Additionally, researchers used a miniature microphone attached to the patient\u2019s anterolateral neck just below the cricoid cartilage to record spontaneous swallows over the course of 30 minutes. The recordings were analyzed by an acoustic software program, and spontaneous swallow frequency rate was calculated as swallows per minute (SPM). Researchers found a significant difference between SPM among those patients identified as having dysphagia and those without. For the patients with dysphagia, SPM was 0.23 and for the nondysphagic group it was 0.56. Researchers recommended further research into this method as a dysphagia screening tool(25) \u2013Trial of compensatory strategies -During the portion of the BSE in which the SLP presents the patient with trials of food, it is appropriate for the SLP to attempt specific compensatory strategies in an effort to discover the type of therapy to which the patient will respond(13) -Alternating solids and liquids -Chin down -Downward pressure with the spoon to assist initiation of swallow response -Head tilt to the right or left -Head rotation to the right or left -Liquids given by spoon only -For detailed information on compensatory strategies used in dysphagia therapy, refer to Clinical Reviews on this topic ",

Decision to initiate oral intake for these patients was based entirely on the single assessment; none of these patients had both types of swallowing assessments. FOTT is comprehensive program that provides a structured assessment and treatment for disturbances of facial muscles, speech- and swallowing-related  jaw movements, breathing, swallowing, and the voice. The FOTT assessment is a clinical, noninstrumental examination of swallowing. Of the 138 patients included in the study, 16 developed pneumonia (4 FOTT/12 FEES); however, 9 were excluded from analysis because 6 developed pneumonia before oral intake was initiated and 3 had a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia but no radiological signs. Of the 7 included in analysis, 3 patients assessed by FOTT and 4 patients assessed by FEES developed aspiration pneumonia. For this reason, researchers concluded that there was no significant difference between the FOTT and FEES assessments; however, the sample size was very small, resulting in low sensitivity(26) -For detailed information on instrumental assessments of dysphagia, see Clinical Review\u2026Dysphagia Assessment: Modified Barium Swallow (Adults) ; CINAHL Topic ID Number:T709046; Clinical Review\u2026Dysphagia Assessment: Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES) ; CINAHL Topic ID Number:T709038; and Clinical Review\u2026 Dysphagia Assessment: Manometry ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T709040 ",
