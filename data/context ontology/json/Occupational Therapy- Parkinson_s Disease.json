Additionally, there was low to moderate evidence suggesting that more complex, multimodal activity training supports improvement in functional movement activities. Researchers reported that there is moderate evidence supporting the efficacy of external supports during functional mobility or other movement activities on motor control.

            "Feldenkrais method-based  exercise programs may improve quality of life (QoL) and improve depression(54) \u2013Based on an RCT conducted in Brazil; outcome measures included Parkinson\u2019s Disease Quality of Life questionnaire (PDQL), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and MMSE \u2013Intervention group received 50 treatment sessions (2x/wk) which emphasized \u201cawareness through movement\u201d focusing on breathing, rolling over, sitting, standing, squatting, and walking \u2013Control group received lectures over the same time period, focusing on falls prevention, medication management, and activities of daily living \u2013The intervention group had significant improvements compared to baseline, and compared to the control group in QoL, rate of depression, and mental state score. In addition there was a positive correlation between depression and cognition in the Feldenkrais group \u2013The study did not include long-term  follow-up,  so it is unknown what the duration of the immediate post intervention benefits would be",

            "Tai chi may improve physical function in PD(51,57) \u2013Based on a meta-analysis(51) and systematic review(57) \u2013Evidence suggests that tai chi may improve motor function and balance, but there is insufficient evidence to conclude a cause and effect relationship between tai chi and improvements in PD",
            "\u201cAlternate\u201d exercises may be useful in improving motor performance and quality of life in patients with PD(62) \u2013The authors of a systematic review found that dancing, water exercise, and robotic gait training were effective treatments and there was some evidence to support virtual reality training, mental practice, aerobic exercise, boxing, and Nordic walking training in the treatment of PD .
