            "Frailty is a clinical syndrome resulting from multisystem impairments. Frailty increases in prevalence in older adults (> 65 years of age) but is not considered part of normal aging(30)",
            "Frailty results in a functional decline in older adults that necessitates the assistance of others to perform activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental ADLs (iADLs)",
            "There is no agreed definition of frailty in the medical literature. The two most common classification approaches measure different constructs. They are the Fried frailty phenotype, known to define and measure the biological syndrome, and the Frailty Index (FI), knownas a deficit accumulation model of frailty(33,34)",
            "Developed in 2001 by Fried, the frailty phenotype is defined by the presence of three or more of the following five components. Presence of one or two of these criteria is considered prefrail, intermediate frail, or vulnerable to frailty(31) \u2013Unintentional weight loss (more than 10 lb/4.5 kg in past year) \u2013Self-reported  exhaustion \u2013Weakness (as measured with grip strength) \u2013Slow walking speed \u2013Low physical activity",
            "The FI was first defined by Rockwood and Mitnitski. It comprises 70 multidimensional health deficits including symptoms, disease, cognition, and disability. A higher number of health deficits indicates more severe frailty. The score is calculated _ as the number of deficits the patient has divided by the number of deficits considered,with 0 representing the least frailty and 1 representing the most severe frailty(34)",
            "Multiple instruments are used to measure frailty; these will be discussed in the Special tests specific to diagnosis section",
            "The term frailty is used clinically to refer to older patients with low functional reserve who are vulnerable to external stressors and at high risk for adverse outcomes, including disability, hospitalization, institutionalization, and death. Frailty is not synonymous with either comorbidity or disability. Comorbidity is an etiologic risk factor for frailty, and disability is an outcome of frailty(32)",
            "Individuals may present with deficits in cognition and sensorimotor input and integration. Multiple medication intake, dehydration, and malnutrition can also lead to frailty ",
            "This Clinical Review focuses on the components of frailty that occupational therapists can address: unintentional weight and muscle loss, persistent fatigue, increased fall risk, and functional decline in strength, gait speed, and ADLs or application of equipment Generalized weakness and decreased cardiovascular fitnessImprove functional strength and cardiovascular fitnessTherapeutic exercise _ Home exercise programs Strength Balance Cardiovascular conditioning _ Group exercise programs Strength Balance CardiovascularIncrease number of repetitions of exercises as patient\u2019s strength and endurance improveProvide patient and family/caregivers with written instructions regarding home exercise program and correct use and/ or application of equipment .

            "The syndrome is thought to be associated with ageing but is not an inevitable consequence of it. It is a cascade of functionaldecline in older adults from robustness to prefrailty to frailty to disability in which patients can transition between states.The patient may have a hospitalization that transitions them from a robust state to frailty. On the other hand, an increase inphysical activity can help transition a patient from frailty back to prefrailty(32)",
            "It has been proposed that decreased total energy expenditure, due mainly to insufficient physical activity, initiates a \u201cfrailtycycle\u201d that perpetuates the risk of further decline and greater disability with advancing age(37)\u2013Components of the frailty cycle include neuroendocrine dysregulation, anorexia, chronic undernutrition, negative energyand nitrogen balance, weight loss, sarcopenia, reduced daily activity, decreased physical fitness (e.g., aerobic power,strength), slow walking speed, hypometabolic state, and disability in ADLs",
