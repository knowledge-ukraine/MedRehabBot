            "The proposed mechanism of injury is repetitive impingement due to overuse and mechanical factors. Both friction andcompression of the IT band are likely involved(1,24,25)\u2013Initially, theories about ITBS stated that the irritation was due to a movable IT band that crosses over the lateral femoralepicondyle with knee flexion and extension, especially at 30\u00b0 of flexion. However, authors of a 2017 study suggested anew paradigm in which tissue is exposed to repeated impingement forces during repeated flexion/extension activities inweight bearing due in large part to a loss in neuromuscular control(23)-The evidence presented in this new paradigm contradicts the friction theory. Research has shown mechanical rollover ofthe IT band is unlikely due to multiple IT band insertions and because the IT band itself is not able to be stretched(23,25)\u2013Results from a United States study suggest that IT band strain rate during gait may contribute to the development of ITBSin female runners(3)-Thirty-four  runners were divided into 2 groups (n = 7 each) according to whether they developed ITBS in a concurrentstudy; one group consisted of runners with ITBS,and the comparison group remained injury free-Each runner\u2019s strain rate was derived indirectly using a lower-extremity  computer model. IT bandstrain ratewas definedas \u201cthe slope of the strain-time  profile from touchdown (of the foot) to mid-support,\u201d  or change in strain divided by thechange in time \u201cfrom touchdown to maximum knee flexion\u201d(3)-Results indicate that the strain rate was significantly higher in the group with ITBS",
            "There is an association between narrow step width and IT band strain. A narrow step width leads to increased hip adductionand knee internal rotation, which increases IT band strain(17)"
        ],
        "pathogenesis": [
            "The IT band functions as a stabilizer of the femur and tibiofemoral joint early in the stance phase of the gait cycle.Force absorption and eccentric stability are exerted by the gluteus medius and tensor fascia lata through the IT band inweight-bearing  activity. Maximal IT band contact with soft tissues at the lateral femoral epicondyle occurs in the stancephase with knee flexion at about 30\u00b0(24,25)",
            "Synovial inflammation and hyperplasia develop in fat and other highly vascularized soft tissue deep to the IT band.MRI studies suggest that inflammation develops and fluid collects in the \u201clateral synovial recess\u201d (lateral extension andinvagination) of the knee joint capsule without changes in the IT band per se. Consequently, the terms tendonitis  andtendinosis  may be inappropriate descriptors for classic ITBS(4)",
            "Researchers in the United Stateswho used dynamic sonography found that fluid deep in the IT band could be traced backto the knee joint in a cadaveric model. They found that the lateral synovial recess regularly extends beneath the anterior ITband, suggesting that fluid deep to the ITB should prompt further evaluation of the knee joint(19)",
            "Authors of a2019 case study assessed the incidence and pathology of proximal ITBS. They found MRI evidence of edemaalong the aponeurotic fascia of the gluteals and fascial origin along the proximal ITB(27)\u2013The authors postulated that proximal ITBSin females is related to the increased width of the female pelvis, which resultsin increased adductiontorque at the hip. This subsequently increases the strain placed on the proximal ITB",
            "In theory, repetitive and/or forced femoral abduction could promote overuse of the IT band as a knee stabilizer. It isprobably for this reason that running on a lateral incline (crowned road or cambered surface) places the downhill orabducted leg at greater risk of injury. Shortening of the IT band/TFL complex could also promote femoral abduction.Although counterintuitive, running at a faster than usual pace might reduce the pain associated with ITBS, possibly becauseof the reduced duration of the stance phase at the critical angle of 30\u00b0(1)"

        "treatment summary": [
            "Authors of a 2017 study suggest that steroidal injections, IT band stretching, deep tissue/friction massage, and therapeutic modalities aimed at stretching a tight IT band are not supported. Instead, the focus of treatment should be activity modification, addressing modifiable risk factors, hip strengthening, and neuromuscular control training(23)",
            "Current opinion is that the initial treatment for ITBS should typically involve conservative relative rest, ice, activity modification, pain management, soft-tissue  mobilization, stretching (see study findingd above), and progressive strengthening.(23,25) ITBS most often responds to conservative intervention. However, results from a 2007 systematic review suggest that there is not a significant benefit of physical therapy over rest alone(10)",
            "Active intervention includes pain management (cryotherapy, NSAIDs), muscle reeducation for strengthening long adductors, strengthening the hip abductors (especially the gluteus medius), and stretching the IT band/TFL complex.(1,2,23,25) Treatment plans should emphasize sport-specific  training, acceptable approaches to relative rest and activity modification, and any biomechanical training errors that can be contributing to the patient\u2019s symptoms \u2013Strengthening exercises that focus on the gluteus medius include hip hikes, clams, step downs, lateral monster walks, and elastic band resistance at 45\u00b0 angle(15)",
            "In Canada, researchers studied 16 individuals with ITBS to determine the effects of strengthening the hip abductors as part of a multimodal physiotherapy program(14) \u2013Subjects aged 20 to 53 years (5 men, 11 wo \u2013men) participated in a 6-week  rehabilitation program that emphasized hip abductor strengthening. Researchers used a handheld dynamometer to measure strength every 2 weeks \u2013Results indicated a trend toward a significant difference in hip abductor strength between the affected and unaffected sides at baseline; however, following the 6-week  training program there was no difference between the affected and unaffected extremities \u2013Hip abductor strength was also found to be significantly related to physical function at 2, 4, and 6 weeks",
            "Massage and dry needling of myofascial trigger points were associated with decreased stiffness and lengthening of the TFL/IT band complex in 19 rugby players, averaging 19 years of age(16)",
            "Radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy (EST) may be as effective as manual therapy in runners with ITBS(22) \u2013Based on a randomized controlled trial conducted in Finland involving 24 runners with ITBS \u2013Patients were randomly assigned to either EST or manual therapy. Treatments were given once weekly for three weeks,and all patients did exercise program for 4 weeks. No control group was included \u2013The outcome measure was pain during treadmill running",
            "Authors of a 2021 systematic review that included three RCTs, three pre-test\u2013post-test  studies, and six case reports/series determined that conservative management of ITBS has favorable outcomes(40) \u2013Acutely, EST, rest, and ice are recommended. ITB stretching and hip abductor strengthening should begin after the acute phase \u2013Mulligan mobilization with movement techniques is useful in reducing pain and improving function in patients with ITBS",
            "Authors of a 2019 systematic review and meta-analysis  determined that conservative management was effective in reducing pain and preventing recurrence of ITBS for up to 6 months(30) \u2013Conservative management consisted of 6 weeks of rehabilitation with NSAID prescription, ITB stretching, and hip abductor strengthening",
            "Authors of a 2020 RCTdivided 24 female runners with ITBS into ITB stretching, conventional exercise, and experimental hip strengthening groups. Results from the study showed no statistical difference between groups, but the experimental hip strengthening group had improved outcome measures and never scored lower than the other two groups(41) \u2013Outcome measures were LEFS, numeric pain rating scale, Y balance test, strength dynamometer, and single limb mini-squat \u2013Exercises in the experimental hip strengthening group consisted largely of side-lying  hip abductor and core strengthening exercises with gradual progression to multi-joint,  standing, and unilateral stance positions, while the conventional stretching and strengthening programs consisted of the same four exercises over the course of the study ",
            "Authors of a 2020 study concluded that after 6 weeks of physiotherapy runners with ITBS had a significant reduction in pain(42) \u2013They used ultrasonography to determine that ITB tension was not increased in recreational runners with ITBS \u2013Fourteen participants with ITBS had deficits in hip abduction, adduction, internal rotation, and external rotation strength compared with 14 healthy controls of both sexes \u2013Improvements were noted in strength of all directions save abduction \u2013ITB stiffness was increased in the ITBS group by 14%",
            "In a 2021 RCT investigators assessed the effects of foam rolling and stretching on ITB stiffness. They determined that that a single session of stretching and foam rolling does not affect ITB stiffness in the shortterm(43) \u2013The study used ultrasonography to measure soft tissue tension at three locations along the IT band \u2013Researchers postulated that more than one intervention may be necessary to see an effect on ITB tension, which aligns with the myofascial plasticity theory that indicates tissue changes occur slowly over time .
