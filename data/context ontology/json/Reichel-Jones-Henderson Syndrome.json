            "Synovial osteochondromatosis (SOC) is a rare, benign, proliferative disorder characterized by the formation of osteochondral nodules in the synovial lining. The chondro/osteochondral formations can develop into loose bodies in the affected joint(3,4)",
            "SOC can involve any joint and has been reported in 33 different locations in the body.(18)It is most common in the large appendicular joints. In the vast majority of cases SOC affects the knee (reported rates vary, but can be up to 70%),(14)followed by the hip, elbow, wrist, ankle, and shoulder. Case reports describe instances in the spine, temporomandibular joint, and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)(15,16,17)",
            "The clinical history includes progressive pain, swelling, and loss of ROM",
            "Although a benign, tumor-like  condition in most cases, SOC can lead to chronic synovial disease and an advancement of arthritic changes and joint damage(13) \u2013In rare occasions, SOC can develop into chondrosarcoma(14)",
            "SOC typically runs a protracted course unresponsive to conservative management. Open or arthroscopic surgical debridement of the loose bodies and excision of the hypertrophied synovium is the treatment of choice(14)"

A CT and ultrasound-guided  synovial biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of SOC. One year after initial symptoms the patient underwent a total synovectomy and removal of the loose bodies(13) -This case emphasizes the importance of revisiting initial evaluations and diagnosis \u2013Recurrence of SOC in the hip can occur and require a hip arthroplasty. Authors of a retrospective study (N = 26) evaluated the long-term  success of hip arthroplasty in patients with SOC. The 15-year  disease-free  survival rate was 89%. Recurrence occurred in three patients. Thirteen patients experienced a complication and seven required revision surgery(12) -The authors concluded that arthroplasty with synovectomy provides reliable pain relief and long-term  disease survival. However, revision and complication rates were high",
            "Elbow \u2013Authors of a retrospective study (N = 11) reviewed patients with elbow SOC who were treated by arthroscopic synovectomy and loose body removal. All patients had restricted ROM prior to surgery with a mean flexion ROM of 100 degrees and a mean extension ROM of 30 degrees. These improved postoperatively to a mean flexion ROM of 130 degrees and mean extension ROM of -5 degrees(18) -The authors concluded that arthroscopic management of elbow SOC was effective andthat after intervention immediate improvement of elbow function can be expected \u2013SOC of the elbow is associated with ulnar or median nerve palsies. Authors of a case study described a patient who developed sudden distal radial nerve palsy. The patient presented with a swollen lateral aspect of the elbow. A 24 mm SOC mass located behind the radial neck was surgically removed to relieve symptoms(20)",
            "Intraligamentous SOC \u2013Authors described a case study of intraligamentous SOC involving the ACL. The authors stated that this is only the second case in the literature, but that SOC should be considered as a diagnosis when MRI findings show irregular, similar-sized  lobulations within the course of the ACL(15)"
