            "Diagnostic criteria are solely based on clinical assessment and patient reports. FM symptoms are subjective in nature. This has created difficulty in establishingguidelines for diagnosis  \u2013American College of Rheumatology (ACR) established the first criteria in 1990: pain present in response to pressure up to 4 kg/cm\u00b2 (exerted with an algometer) in 11 of 18 body points (tender points) and generalized pain present for at least 3 months in at least three of the four body quadrants. These criteria lacked consideration of symptoms including sleep disorders and fatigue, conceptualized FM as an all-or-nothing  disorder rather than existing on a continuum, and had limited validity due to the difficulty of evaluating tender points. Performing a tender point exam is impractical in clinical settings(38) \u2013Despite the limitations of the 1990 ACR guidelines, they did allow for official recognition of FM(38) \u2013In 1992 the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) included FM as a source of disability and WHO recognized it as a disease(38) \u2013In 2010, the ACR changed the diagnostic criteria by eliminating assessment of tender points. The new criteria are based exclusively on the use of two scales: the Widespread Pain Index (WPI) and the Symptom Severity (SS) Scale. Patients must state whether they have certain symptoms on these scales, which must be administered by a physician. To diagnose FM, one of two conditions must be fulfilled: a WPI \u2265 7 and SS \u2265 5 or a WPI between 3 and 6 and SS \u2265 9. Symptomsmust be present for at least 3 months(38) \u2013Wolfe et al. showed that SS scores correlate better with WPI scores (0.73) than with tender point count (0.68)(39) \u2013In 2011 and 2016, Wolf et al. proposedadditional diagnostic criteria for FM, but they are not currently recognized by the ACR. They stated that the requirement for a physician examination was a major barrier to understanding FM prevalence and characteristics; andthey modified the WPI and SS scales to allow for self-administration(38) \u2013The 2016 criteria include the following: (1) Presence of generalized pain, defined as pain in at least four of five regions (four quadrants and axial region) (2) Symptoms have been present at a similar level for at least 3 months (3) WPI \u2265 7 and SS \u2265 5 or WPI of 4\u20136 and SS \u2265 9 (4) A diagnosis of FM is valid irrespective of other diagnoses, and a diagnosis of FM does not exclude the presence of other clinically important illnesses(38)"

        "treatment summary": [
            "Because the cause of FM is unknown, treatment is directed at relieving or controlling symptoms of the disorder. Treatment should be individualized and multidisciplinary. According to EULAR guidelines a combination of nonpharmacological and pharmacological treatments is recommended. The only EULAR recommendation supported by strongevidence is physical exercise(44) \u2013EULAR recommends that initial treatment focus on nonpharmacological treatments tailored according to pain intensity, function, associated features (such as depression), fatigue, sleep disturbances, patient preferences, and comorbidities. It is important to involve the patient in the treatment decision-making process(44)",
            "Clinical practice guidelines for aerobic fitness exercises and strengthening exercises state that exercise is beneficial in the overall management of FM for pain relief, muscle strength, HRQoL, self-efficacy,  and decreased depression. Strengthening programs do not cause exacerbations of exercise-induced  FM symptoms(41)",
            "Authors of a 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis  of RCTs summarized the effectiveness of therapeutic exercise in FM. They concluded that exercise is beneficial for individuals with FM, but were unable to draw conclusions on the most effective type, frequency, duration, and intensity of exercise(47) \u2013There is some evidence for muscle strengthening and aerobic exercise in reducing pain and severity of symptoms \u2013Stretching exercises produced the biggest improvements in HRQoL \u2013Combined exercise is most effective in decreasing depression symptoms in FM \u2013Although there is no consensus, it seems that 2 to 3 sessions per week of mild to moderate intensity physical activity lasting 30\u201345  minutes each are effective",
            "Researchers have studied a wide variety of exercises and severalshow positive results \u2013Stretching: Authors of an RCT (N = 64) investigated the effects of adding stretching to a moderate-intensity exercise program in women with FM. The control group exercised (cycled)3 times per week for 12 weeks at 50\u201370%  of the age-predicted  maximum heart rate. The experimental group performed the same exercise plus a stretching program once weekly for 12 weeks(48) -Adding stretching to a moderate-intensity  aerobic exercise program increased sleep quality, decreased the impact of FM on quality of life, and reduced pain compared to the control group \u2013Breathing exercises:Authors of an RCT (N = 35) examined the effects of a breathing exercise program on pain thresholdsfor tender points and FM impact on daily life. Twelve weeks of breathing exercises led to significant  improvements in pain threshold tolerance for tender points and these gains predicted improvements in functional capacity, pain, and fatigue(49) \u2013Myofascial release:Authors of an RCT (N = 66) found that patients with FM who performed a self-myofascial  release program on the cervical spine, shoulder, and hip had significant improvements in their FIQ scores compared to the control group(33) \u2013Dry needling and TENS: Authors of an RCT (N = 74) compared the effects of dry needling and TENS on pain intensity, heart rate variability, galvanic response, and oxygen saturation(50) -Dry needling and TENS may reduce pain in patients with FM. Greater improvements were reported in the dry needling group across all dimensions of pain \u2013Aquatics: -Authors of an RCT (N = 75) found that swimming can reduce pain and improve functional endurance and QOL in patients with FM(32) -The swimming group swam for 50 minutes 3 times per week for 12 weeks -The walking group walked for 50 minutes 3 times per week for 12 weeks -Results at the end of the study showed a decrease in pain for both groups with no significant difference between groups -Based on a 2013 systematic review and meta-analysis, aquatic exercise therapy for more than 20 weeks may improve FIQ, 6MWT, and dermal stiffness in patients with FM versus no treatment(16) -An RCT in women with FM is underway to evaluate the effectiveness of two different physical therapy protocols, a land-based  program and an aquatic-based program, for improving balance and decreasing pain(51) \u2013Basic Body Awareness Therapy (BBAT):Authors of an RCT (N = 41) aimed to assess whether BBAT improves musculoskeletal pain, movement quality, psychological function, and QOL in patients with FM. BBAT focuses on postural balance, free breathing, and awareness, seeking to integrate them into movement. It consists of movements in the following positions: lying, sitting, standing, and walking. The movements are practiced with components of rhythm, form, elasticity, flow, intention, and voice(36) -The BBAT group showed significant improvements in pain at post-test  and in movement quality from baseline to 24 weeks -The authors concluded that BBAT may be an effective treatment to decrease pain, improve movement quality, and reduce anxiety in patients with FM \u2013Cryotherapy: Authors of an RCT (N = 24) found that whole-body cryotherapy can be recommended as an effective additional approach in improving HRQoL in patients with FM(34) -The intervention group received a total of 10 sessions over 8 days of whole-body  cryotherapy treatment (entered a \u2013110\u00b0 C whole-body  cryotherapy chamber for 3 minutes) as well as usual care activities, while the control group received only usual care activities for FM -Compared to the control group, the intervention group reported significantly improved HRQoL. These effects lasted for at least one month following intervention \u2013Kinesiologytape (KT): -Authors of an RCT (N = 35) evaluated the effect of KT on pain, posture, body comfort, and QOL in patients with FM. Patients were randomized to one of two treatment groups based on the location the KT was applied: upper trunk group and global trunk group(52) -Both KT treatments were effective in reducing pain and improving neck and shoulder comfort -Patients with dorsal soreness may benefit from global trunk KT application and those with neck-specific  discomfort and forward shoulder position may require specific upper trunk KT application -Authors of a study (N = 36) compared the effects of spinal stabilization exercise plus KT and spinal stabilization exercise alone on pain and well-being in women with FM.The spinal stabilization exercise program was performed 2 days per week for 6 weeks with a physical therapist. The program focused on maintaining a neutral spine position and activating core muscles during exercises(45) -Spinal stabilization exercise with KT (placed on the spine using the fascial technique) was superior for improving pain and general well-being compared to spinal stabilization exercise alone \u2013Acupuncture and core stability: Authors of a study (N = 135) investigated the effectiveness of a core stability training program versus acupuncture for the management of balance and functional capacity impairments in women with FM.Patients were randomized into 1 of 3 groups: core stability training, acupuncture, or control. The core stability  training involved transverse abdominis activation, correct alignment, breathing, and correct position of the pelvis in neutral. Then 7 exercises were performed. The acupuncture group received treatment involving the acupuncture points from traditional Chinesemedicine(53) -Core stability training program and acupuncture were found to improve dynamic balance and postural control in women with FM \u2013Massage therapy: Based on a 2013 systematic review and meta-analysis,  massage therapy for greater than 5 weeks may improve pain, anxiety, and depression in patients with FM(9) \u2013Perceptual surface: Authors of an RCT (N = 54) found positive outcomes in reducing pain in females with FM by using a perceptual surface (PS) during therapy interventions. A perceptual surface is defined as a therapeutic approach that is based on interactions of a patient\u2019s back or painful area with a support surface (usually composed of small latex cones with various dimensions and degrees of elasticity)(30) -The PS group was asked to lie supine on the cone-shaped  surface. During the first session, patients were asked to find the most comfortable position and perform breathing exercises consisting of 10 minutes of relaxation breathing and 10 minutes of slow diaphragmatic breathing. Patients were then asked to perform active exercises that consist of bridges, exercises for cross-limb  coordination, and bringing an egg held between the knees to the chest. During subsequent sessions, the therapist would position the cones to improve the symmetry of contact between the patient and the surface to allow for reafferent information from the trunk and body -The physical exercise group performed conventional treatments in 1-hour  sessions twice a week for 5 weeks with 4 patients per group. Exercises included low to moderate aerobic training (40% of HR and up to 50\u201360%  of age-adjusted HR max), generalized walking program, alternating step training (3 steps for 10 minutes), and postural exercises for back and proprioceptive exercises for the trunk in supine -The control group received only a brief educational session, breathing and relaxation techniques, and a stretching program that lasted for 1 hour \u2013Balneotherapy: Authors of an RCT (N = 120) investigated the effect of balneotherapy in patients with FM. Patients were randomized to one of three groups: balneotherapy, balneotherapy with exercise, and exercise only(31) -The balneotherapy group and balneotherapy with exercise group were given 20 minutes of balneotherapy for 5 days a week for 3 weeks at 42 \u00b1 1\u00b0C in thermal water with a mineral content of 556 mg/L bicarbonate, 98.2 mg/L sulphur, 34.5 mg/L magnesium, 226 mg/L calcium, 232 mg/L chlorine, and 2.6 mg/L fluorine. Participants in the balneotherapy with exercise and in the exercise group performed aerobic exercises 5 days a week for 3 weeks. Exercises started at 25 minutes and were extended to 35 minutes in a gradual manner. Exercises included muscle stretching, muscle strengthening, and relaxation exercises and focused on the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar regions -All three groups benefited, resulting in a reduction in FIQ scores; however, those in the balneotherapy with exercise received the greatest benefits in terms of reduction in depression scores, reduction in FIQ score, improved sleep quality, and reduction in pain \u2013Intensity of exercise: Authors of an RCT (N = 60) compared the effects of high-intensity  training (HIIT) and moderate-intensity  continuous training (MICT) combined with strengthening and stretching exercises in patients with FM(54) -HIIT included a 5-minute  warm-up  at 50% of peak HR and 4 cycles of 4 minutes at 80%\u201395%  of peak HR followed by 3-minute  recovery intervals at 70% of peak HR -MICT included 45 minutes at 65%\u201370%  of peak HR -Each aerobic training session was followed by standardized strengthening and stretching exercise -The HIIT plus strengthening and stretching exercises group and the MICT plus strengthening and stretching exercises group showed significant improvements in pain, functional capacity, and QOL.
