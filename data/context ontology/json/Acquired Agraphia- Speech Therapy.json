            "Agraphia is an acquired disorder of written language that results in an inability to spell both words and nonwords.(2) The inaccuracies manifest in both written and oral spelling(3)",
            "Agraphia results from damage to the cognitive mechanism that is responsible for oral and written spelling. A dual model of spelling developed by Barry and Ellis describes two ways in which spelling words is accomplished.(3) These are known as the \u201csemantic/ lexical route\u201d and the \u201cnon-lexical  route\u201d(2,3) \u2013According to this model, in the semantic/lexical route, the meaning of a word supports the correct spelling of that word (i.e., knowing when to use the spelling \u201cright\u201d vs. \u201cwrite\u201d). If a person is able to spell without  using the meaning of words, errors such as FLOWER for \u201cflour\u201d can occur(4) \u2013In the non-lexical  route, phonemes (sounds) are converted to graphemes (letters) and it is possible to spell unfamiliar words, unknown words, or nonwords accurately(2,3) \u2013These two routes are posited to converge at a \u201cgraphemic output buffer\u201d level, which is thought to be housed in the part of the brain in which graphemic representations of words are \u201cheld\u201d prior to being either written down or spelled aloud(2,3,4) -Letter position errors, such as MABRLE for \u201cmarble,\u201d are thought to reflect damage at the graphemic output buffer level(5) \u2013The words must then be converted from the abstract sounds/representations in the graphemic output buffer level to letter shapes (e.g., upper and lower case, cursive, print), which is thought to take place via allographic conversion(2,4) -An allograph is defined as the unique production of a grapheme (i.e., each person writes the letter \u201ca\u201d in his or her own unique way, but all productions symbolize the same grapheme, \u201ca\u201d)(4) \u2013Agraphia manifests in different forms depending on which portion of the spelling process is damaged.(2,3,4) For example, if the semantic/lexical route is damaged, words will be spelled incorrectly but nonwords will be relatively preserved.(2) If the damage is in the graphemic output buffer level, all words and nonwords will be spelled  incorrectly because the person will be unable to \u201chold\u201d the graphemic representation in his or her mind prior to writing it down and spelling it aloud(3)"

Authors of a case study from Japan described a patient who developed pure agraphia for the Romaji system after experiencing an infarction of the left inferior frontal gyrus.

Specific labels might be applied to cases of agraphia that demonstrate the following characteristics: Allographic conversion impairment \u2013 patient may produce incorrect, although well-formed,  letters (i.e., writing \u201cc\u201d when the word is spelled with a \u201cg\u201d), or the patient will seem to \u201cforget\u201d how to form the letter altogether(4) Deep agraphia/deep dysgraphia/global agraphia \u2013 patient demonstrates increased difficulty with low frequency, abstract, and function words (those with little lexical meaning; e.g., prepositions, conjunctions, articles) and difficulty spelling unfamiliar or nonwords, as well as demonstrating semantic errors (writing CAT for \u201cdog\u201d)(2,4)  Graphemic buffer disorder \u2013 patient has increased difficulty spelling long words vs. short words (\u201clength effect\u201d); errors occur in the middle of words vs. the beginning and end of words; improved accuracy with concrete, high frequency, early acquired words(3,4) Lexical agraphia/surface agraphia \u2013 patient has increased difficulty spelling irregular, low frequency words(4) Phonological agraphia \u2013 patient has increased difficulty with low frequency, abstract, and function words as well as difficulty spelling unfamiliar words or nonwords(4) Spatial dysgraphia \u2013 when paper is placed in front of the patient, the patient writes but ignores part of the paper (usually the left side); drawing and line bisection are also affected(6)",

        "referral to other disciplines": "Referrals should be made to physical and occupational therapy if an underlying motor or muscle control/strength deficit appears to be the cause of the writing disorder. Referral to neurology for a full neurological workup should be made when a patient presents with an agraphia with no known underlying cause. Referral to psychology, psychiatry, or neuropsychology should be made if the patient reports feelings of depression, hopelessness, or other emotional distress. Referral to ophthalmology should be made if patient presents with visual field cut or poor vision",
        "other considerations": [],
        "treatment summary": [
            "Some researchers encourage structuring agraphia therapy around the model of errorless learning, which is currently being applied to most forms of speech therapy;(1,3) however, in a study conducted in the United States involving 4 patients with agraphia, researchers found that errorless and errorful training of spelling resulted in similar therapeutic gains, with a slightly larger treatment effect noted for those words trained through the errorful program(22) \u2013Despite the slightly larger improvement with words trained through errorful learning, the patients reported that the errorless learning model was more enjoyable because the errorful model became frustrating at times(22)",
            "Copy and Recall Treatment (CART): a treatment protocol in which the patient copies target words repeatedly followed by delayed copying trials(2,4) \u2013Studies have shown improved spelling of the target words;(2,4) more success is seen when a limited number of words are chosen at one time and are then trained to mastery(4) \u2013Daily written homework in which patient copies target words from 5 sets of labeled pictures 20 times each followed by written naming task to test the recall of words copied(2) \u2013In a small study conducted in the United Kingdom using CART, researchers demonstrated improvement in spelling of trained words as well as improvement in spelling of 6 untrained words. Overall outcomes for the group revealed significant improvements in written picture description tasks, but did not show improvements in functional tasks such as email writing and writing frequency, nor did the participants report improvement in the overall perception of disability(32)",
            "Problem-solving  method(4) \u2013Treatment approach that serves as a compensatory strategy for spelling by teaching patients to \u201csound out\u201d words they are trying to spell.(4) Patients are taught to use this problem-solving  method when they are writing paragraphs, journals, diaries, and other lengthy written passages. Patients are taught to use an electronic spell-checker  to improve accuracy. The following is an example of the problem-solving  method:(4) -When you are writing and you are unsure how a word is spelled, try to sound it out -Review what you have written and if it looks incorrect, try writing several variations -Select the spelling that \u201clooks right\u201d -Enter this spelling into the electronic spell-checker to either see if it is correct or if the correct spelling is given -Copy the correct word into your passage -Rewrite the sentence or paragraph with the correct spelling for reinforcement  \u2013Research shows some carryover with this strategy to improve overall spelling knowledge(4) \u2013In a case series study conducted in the United States, researchers treated three individuals with alexia and agraphia resulting from stroke by simultaneously addressing reading and writing impairments. For the written language/ spelling treatment, the three participants were taught to use three strategies: checking to see if the word looked correct, then sounding it out, and finally, checking the spelling with an electronic speller. Irregularly spelled, low-frequency words were used for treatment sessions. The extent of improvement varied between participants, but all three showed improvements in reading and writing. For writing, researchers documented improvements in spelling accuracy across words that were not specifically trained in therapy (indicating carryover)(30)",
            "Anagram-and-Copy  Treatment (ACT)(4) \u2013Patients are given the letters of a target word in an anagram and asked to rearrange the letters to form the target word(2,4) \u2013The following is an example of this type of treatment:(4) -The patient is shown a picture and asked to name the picture and write the word. If the patient is able to write the word, the clinician moves on to the next item; if not, continue to the next 3 steps -The letters of the word are provided to the patient in random order on tiles or slips of paper, and the patient is told to arrange them to spell the word. Once the patient spells the word, he or she is asked to copy it three times. If the patient is incorrect, the clinician arranges the letters and the patient copies the word three times -Once the patient is able to perform the above task successfully, the letters of the word plus 2 foils (one consonant and one vowel) are presented. The above procedure is repeated with these letters -Finally, the patient is asked to write the word to dictation without a visible target to copy \u2013For homework, the patient is given a picture and written word at the top of a page with 20 blank lines for the patient to repeatedly copy the word. A \u201crecall\u201d page is also provided that consists of pictures with blanks for the patient to fill in without a target word to copy(4) \u2013ACT has been shown to promote relearning of a set of personally significant written words for patients with severe aphasia.(4) There is no research to date that demonstrates carryover to untrained words",
            "Orthographic neighborhood treatment(3) \u2013In a research study conducted in the United Kingdom, researchers sought to examine the effect of training words with large \u201corthographic neighborhoods\u201d to increase carryover in therapy. An orthographic neighbor is a word that can be made by changing only one letter in the word. For example, the word CASK has a large orthographic neighborhood that includes CASE, CAST, TASK, MASK, CASH, and BASK. The word EDIT has a small orthographic neighborhood that includes only EMIT and EXIT(3) \u2013The subject was trained across two therapy sessions, 1 hour each, with targeted words with large orthographic neighborhoods. The following is the procedure used in this study: -Pairwise comparisons: With the correctly spelled target word at the top of the page, the patient was given sets of two words, one being the target word and one an incorrect spelling of the target word (e.g., SA V AGE: SA VGE). The patient was to select the correctly spelled word, identify the error in the misspelled word, and rewrite it correctly(3) -Insert missing letters: With the correctly spelled target word at the top of the page, reproductions of the target word were listed with some letters missing each time. The patient was asked to fill in the missing letters (e.g., HERESY: H-R-SY)(3) -Word search grids: The patient was given traditional word search grids in which the target words were hidden horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. The list of target words was present below the word search and the patient was to find each target word in the grid(3) \u2013In this specific study, the subject demonstrated improved spelling for both target words and words in the target words\u2019 orthographic neighborhood that were not specifically trained.(3) Improvements were evident at 1 and 6 weeks post therapy",
            "V oice recognition software(23) \u2013In a prospective case study involving a 65-year-old English-speaking  woman with conduction aphasia and agraphia, researchers used a voice recognition software program to improve functional writing ability(23) -Treatment consisted of ten 1-hour  sessions over the course of 4 weeks(23) -Software was the Dragon Naturally Speaking program(23)  -The patient was trained in basic computer skills as well as specific use of the software program in order to write e-mails, which was the patient-determined  goal of therapy(23) -By the sixth session, the patient was 100% independent with computer and software set-up tasks(23) -After the 10 treatment sessions, the patient was able to dictate and edit short, novel messages via the voice recognition software, including e-mails  for work, shopping lists, and personal messages to friends and family(23) -In baseline tests of computer and writing skills, the patient scored a total of 12/102 points (11.8%); after 10 weeks, the patient scored 88/102 points (86.3%)(23)",
            "Prism adaptation(6) \u2013In a case study from France, an apparatus was used to reduce the subject\u2019s left-sided  neglect when writing. The apparatus was described as a two-layer  rectangular wooden box-like frame that the patient sat in front of and toward the top of which he rested his chin; the patient wore prismatic lenses to shift his visual field to the right. While he was in this device he was asked to point straight forward, bisect a line, free draw a picture, and give a handwriting sample. The total time he spent exposed to the prism was about 3 minutes(6) \u2013Following the exposure to the prism adaptation, the patient was assessed immediately, as well as 2, 24, and 48 hours post exposure. The patient demonstrated improvement in all measures of agraphia (neglected surface, broken lines, lines inclination, and graphic errors)(6)",
            "Imageability technique(27) \u2013Authors of a case study described agraphia therapy for a 58-year-old  male with primary progressive aphasia. The patient\u2019s case was unique in that the initial symptoms were difficulty writing and spelling. Over the course of 9 years, speech fluency progressively worsened, and eventually he was unable to speak. Because the patient demonstrated a strong imageability effect in his initial reading evaluation (better able to read concrete, imageable words [e.g., parakeet] versus abstract words [e.g., there]), the authors used an imageability technique to improve writing. An associative strategy was used to link concrete words and mental images to remember letter names (e.g., B = bee; X = X-ray)  and he was asked to generate country names to associate with each letter of the alphabet (e.g., A = Afghanistan, B = Belgium). In treatment sessions, the therapist cued him to speak the country names out loud to help him remember the letters. He had more difficulty with vowels, so consonants were trained first. Initially, the patient\u2019s performance improved and at one of his assessments he was able to name 95% of consonants and 80% of vowels; however, because of his underlying diagnosis he eventually declined to 0% over the course of 2 years(27)",
            "Letter-picture  technique(1) \u2013Authors of a case study described a unique approach to therapy for writing and spelling deficits in which a globally agraphic, English-speaking  patient was taught to utilize his intact visual memory as well as his ability to accurately arrange written letters to form a complete word(1) \u2013Therapists taught the patient to take each letter and distort it slightly to create a picture that resembled the word. For example, with the word \u201ccup,\u201d the \u201cc\u201d was placed at the bottom to represent a saucer and the \u201cu\u201d and the \u201cp\u201d were placed on top to form the cup and handle(1) \u2013The patient was able to memorize the drawings, and once they were recreated he could rearrange the letters within the picture to form the word he wanted to write. The patient eventually began creating his own \u201cletter-pictures\u201d  to regain a vocabulary(1) \u2013After 5 months, the patient\u2019s written vocabulary increased from 24 to 91 words. Eventually, the therapists were able to utilize similar techniques to begin retraining the patient to speak as well(1) \u2013Once the letter-pictures  had been established, the patient was instructed to independently copy them repeatedly at home to aid memorization (1) .
