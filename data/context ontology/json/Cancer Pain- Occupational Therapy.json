            "Cancer is a major cause of death in the United States (26.6% of deaths), second only to heart disease(1)",
            "Pain is commonly experienced by persons with cancer and can be caused by either the cancer itself, treatment methods, diagnostic tests, or a combination of factors(5)",
            "Cancer pain may negatively impact quality of life and daily functioning(5,26)",
            "The pain experienced by persons with cancer usually implies a pathologic process.(3) There are three major categories of pain, somatic, visceral, and neuropathic, resulting from activation and sensitization of nociceptors and mechanoreceptors by either mechanical or chemical stimuli. These three types of pain may occur alone or together in the same patient(3)",
            "Cancer pain can also be classified as either acute pain (comes on quickly, but is short-lasting),  chronic pain (continuous pain or pain that comes back often), or breakthrough pain (intense and sudden rise in pain that may be related to a certain activity or has no apparent cause and occurs even when a person is taking pain medications)(18)",
            "Patients with advanced cancer often have multiple complaints of pain at different places in the body(1)",
            "The prevalence of cancer-related  pain is estimated to be 30\u201350%  in patients undergoing chronic cancer treatment and over 70% in patients with advanced disease(1)",
            "Authors of a 2007 systematic review and a meta-analysis  of 40 years of pooled evidence (52 studies) found that(4) \u201333% of patients had pain after curative treatment \u201359% of patients had pain while undergoing anticancer treatment \u201364% of patients had pain with advanced/metastatic/terminal disease \u201353% of patients had pain at all disease stages \u2013Over onethird of patients with pain graded their pain as moderate or severe \u2013Pain had the highest prevalence in patients with head/neck cancer",
            "The British Pain Society states that physical and occupational therapists have \u201can important role in the management of cancer pain and have specific skills that enable them to be patient-focused  and holistic\u201d(6)",
            "Occupational therapists have a unique role in oncology by addressing pain, through interventions to improve strength and mobility, modification of activities to  conserve energy, and modification of environments such as the workplace, home, or community(6,7)",
            "It is generally agreed that occupational therapists play a role in the assessment and management of patients with cancer-related  pain, but the lack of evidence-based  research that supports the use of OT presents a challenge(6,8)"

Examples are local-use anesthetics, peripheral nerve, celiac plexus, lumbar sympathetic, and stellate ganglion blocks(3) Authors of a case report involving 5 patients described how continuous peripheral nerve blocks using ropivacaine were effective in managing chronic pain in patients with varying types of cancer, were welltolerated  by patients, and may be an appropriate alternative to opioids in managing cancerrelated  pain in selected cases(24) Catheters for drug administration were placed in either the upper or lower extremity depending on the area most affected by pain; doses of ropivacaine were administered via a PCA pump; the duration of drug administration ranged from 12 to 110 days Patients reported decreased pain, with complete resolution for most; improved satisfaction; and improved quality of life Treatment with the continuous nerve block also reduced the need to use other analgesic drugs Other possible treatments are epidural and interspinal analgesia, neuroablative and neurostimulatory procedures for the relief of pain, and trigger point injection and acupuncture(3) Authors of a systematic review found that intrathecal therapy may be an appropriate approach to manage chronic cancerrelated  pain in patients with and without active disease(25) The use of morphine (opioid) and ziconotide (nonopioid) delivered via an intrathecal pump was investigated Results discussed in the review indicated a trend toward improved pain in patients treated with intrathecal morphine, ziconotide, and/or combination drug therapy, as well as fewer systemic side effects than traditional drug administration Researchers highlighted the importance of a multidisciplinary treatment team and drug trialing prior to pump implantation to identify appropriate patients for intrathecal therapy Researchers of a study designed to investigate the use of \u201cCalmare therapy\u201d (a form of electrical stimulation to treat pain) found the treatment approach to be effective in reducing pain levels associated with chemotherapyinduced peripheral neuropathy, metastatic bone pain, and postsurgical  neuropathic pain(29) The study involved a 1-week  baseline period, a 2-week  treatment period, and a 2-week  follow-up visit Treatment involved the use of 1\u22125 sets of electrodes placed near painful sites with electrical impulses delivered to the sites; each treatment lasted 40 minutes and patients received 1 treatment per day for 10 days; treatment followed a general protocol for the use of Calmare therapy with the intensity of the electrical stimulus being gradually increased based on patient tolerance and analgesic response At follow-up,  pain scores on a self-report measure significantly improved from baseline; patients also reported improved functional status and decreased use of rescue opioids",
