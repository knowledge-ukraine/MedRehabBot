Relevant tests and measures (listed in order of administration)  Screening measures  (12) Screening measures frequently are used to determine if the child is likely to meet or fail to meet educational goals(12) In kindergarten and 1st grade, screening measures frequently focus on reading readiness or reading ability(12) Screening measures typically are given only once(12) An example of a screening measure is the Get Ready to Read (GRTR) screening tool (20 items examining print knowledge, emerging writing, and phonological awareness)(25) Studies indicate that schools save money by conducting two stages of screening, which reduces false positives; that is, students who unnecessarily enter expensive secondary prevention(12) Progress monitoring tools Eye-tracking  software can be a valuable, objective tool for psycho-behavioral  interventions in neurodevelopmental disorders(35) Students are frequently (14 times per month) given brief (13 minute) assessments to determine whether or not they are mastering the curriculum and meeting long-term  benchmark goals(12) Scores might be plotted on a graph to evaluate the student\u2019s rate of progress over time and his or her level of performance(12) The use of criterion-referenced  progress-monitoring  measures that can reliably capture growth over time is critical within an RTI framework. Progress-monitoring  measures are considered dynamic indices because they measure change in response to systematic instruction(12) -If results from progress-monitoring  tools consistently show that the student is not progressing as desired when given Tier 1 instruction, the student should be referred for Tier 2 intervention(12) -Progress monitoring is continued on a weekly basis for students receiving Tier 2 intervention. Those who respond well to Tier 2 intervention and make desired improvement might return to Tier 1 intervention only. However, for students who continue to have difficulty making desired progress, Tier 2 intervention should be continued or Tier 3 intervention provided(12) Progress-monitoring  tools should be quick and easy to administer, score, and analyze since they are intended to be used frequently(15) Researchers investigating RTI programs have developed Individual Growth & Development Indicators 2.0 (IGDIs 2.0), which are a set of measures used for monitoring the growth and development of children as a result of participation in -Picture-naming  vocabulary (oral language)(26,27) -Which one doesn\u2019t belong?

In a traditional caseload perspective, an SLP\u2019s amount of work is calculated based on the number of children with a speech/language disability for whom the SLP provides direct services. A workload focus considers a wider variety of tasks for which the SLP is responsible: consulting with classroom teachers, consulting with agencies outside the school, classroom/student observations, and paperwork(22)",
            "As SLPs become involved in RTI, they must expand their field of knowledge to include: 1) the ways in which speech and language, classroom instruction, and student performance affect one another; 2) grade-level  curriculum standards; 3) federal mandates regarding school accountability, including requirements to document \u201cadequate yearly progress\u201d; 4) the number of students with disabilities attending a particular school and the testing modifications and accommodations permitted for those students;(22)and 5) how to critically evaluate and develop sound, valid progress-monitoring instruments(15)",

In dynamic RTI, students who had the weakest reading abilities (based on initial screening scores) were \u201cfast-tracked\u201d  into Tier 2 or 3 depending on their skill profile. There were 34 schools included in the yearlong trial and researchers trained the teachers to implement each of the two RTI conditions in the same manner across schools.
