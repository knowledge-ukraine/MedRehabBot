            "A ventriculotomy is a surgical procedure in which an incision is made in a ventricle of the brain.(1) In many cases, a shunt or catheter is placed in the incision in order to relieve pressure from a buildup of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or blood. In a procedure called an endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV), a hole is created in the floor of the third ventricle to allow CSF to bypass an obstruction in the ventricle system.(11) In the case of an ETV , there is no placement of a shunt or catheter(11) or application of equipment Cognitive impairments To improve the patient\u2019s cognitive capabilities in functional tasksFunctional training _ Therapy will focus on improving cognitive skills as well as incorporating compensatory strategies into functional activitiesAs the patient\u2019s cognitive abilities improve, the OT will increase cognitive demands and task complexityProvide the patient with cognitive exercises; daily completion of exercises as recommended by the treating OT  Perceptual impairments To improve the patient\u2019s perceptual capabilities in functional tasksFunctional training _ Sensory intervention _ _ Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) _ _ Neurodevelopmental training _ _ Therapy will focus on improving perceptual skills as well as incorporating compensatory strategies into functional activitiesAs the patient\u2019s perceptual abilities improve, the OT will increase cognitive demands and task complexityProvide the patient with perceptual exercises; daily completion of exercises as recommended by the treating OT .
