            "Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) is an umbrella term that describes the range of effects that can occur in an individual whose mother drank alcohol during pregnancy.(29) These effects might include physical, mental, behavioral, or learning impairments. The term FASD is not intended for use as a clinical diagnosis. Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most severe end of the FASD spectrum, in which a fetus or newborn is exposed to alcohol and subsequently exhibits a pattern of abnormal facial features and impaired development of the brain/central nervous system (CNS).(4,6) The other diagnostic terms under the umbrella of FASD are partial fetal alcohol syndrome (PFAS) and neurobehavioral disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure (ND-PAE)(30)"

        "treatment summary": [
            "Authors of a systematic review found 12 studies examining interventions for children with FASD that met their inclusion criteria. Authors noted that methodological weaknesses were common (e.g., small sample sizes, poor study design, short-term  follow up). In two randomized controlled trials, there was some benefit observed from stimulant medications. In three randomized controlled trials, there was some evidence to suggest that virtual reality training, cognitive control therapy, language and literacy therapy (described below), mathematics intervention and rehearsal training for memory might be beneficial strategies. Results from three studies on social communication and behavioral strategies indicated that social skills training could improve social skills and behavior problems at home(21)",
            "In a study conducted in South Africa with 65 children, researchers evaluated language treatment specifically for literacy skills(1) \u2013Forty children with FAS were randomly assigned to a language literacy group or a control group. Twenty-five  children without alcohol exposure in utero were randomly selected and were assigned a control group(1) \u2013The study did not describe the randomization method used, and selection bias cannot be ruled out(1) \u2013The language and literacy group focused on phonological awareness and other preliteracy skills necessary for reading and spelling. An SLP administered the treatment for 30 minutes a day twice a week for nine months, totaling 36 hours of intervention(1) \u2013Results: This intervention led to improvements in reading, spelling, and preliteracy skills for the FAS intervention group compared to the FAS control group. However, both FAS groups scored lower than the alcohol unexposed group(1)  . Problem Goal Intervention Expected Progression Home Program Decrease hyperarousal and improve sensory modulationImprove response to various environmental stimuliTherapeutic modalities _ For children with FAS who have sensory processing deficits, the SLP might work with the occupational therapist to improve sensory integration. Examples of ways to help a child with sensory processing difficulties include using a weighted blanket, deep pressure massage, and placing the child on a swing(3)The patient responds appropriately to specific stimuli. Decreasing modeling and cueing is expected as the child\u2019s sensory modulation improves. Educating the caregiver is important to develop effective strategies to promote learning and behavior management. Expect improved self- awareness to positively impact behavior(29)No specific home program specified. However, home practice should involve the family and relevant activities in the home environment to be determined individually Decreased attention Improve attention for all ADLsTherapeutic modalities _ Reduce number of stimuli in treatment room, reduce number of distractions _ _ Use pictures to sequence activities in a session or day _ _ Provide extensive focus on routines to facilitate attention _ _ Provide frequent salient reinforcement to promote attention _ _ Classroom modifications _ Decrease visual and auditory distractions, clearly label activity areas, use large easily visible daily schedules, organize materials so they are easy to find(20)As the child progresses, the number of stimuli can be increased. Gradually reduce support needed to promote appropriate participation by the child. Expect improved ability to participate in tasks that will positively impact behavior, social interaction, and academic progressNo specific home program is specified. However, a home program should involve the family and relevant activities in the home environment to be individually determined  Decreased pragmatic language skillsImprove pragmatic language skills, including initiation and turn takingPragmatic therapy _ Speech therapy focuses on improving initiation, turn taking, topic maintenance, and providing relevant information to the listener through clinician modeling, group therapy, use of games, and play, or simulating daily events in the patient\u2019s life. Also, use of social scripts and role playing is helpful. Use of checklists to increase the child\u2019s ability to assess ability to listen, evaluate consequences, and the listener\u2019s perspective has been beneficial for improved social skills.(28)Common pragmatic difficulties for children with FAS include decreased interpretation of body language and discussing personal information that is not appropriate for the situation.(24) SLPs can assist the child to increase vocabulary to express feelings and emotions. Additionally, SLPs will work improving the child\u2019s awareness of producing relevant statements and decreasing unrelated statements.(24) Addressing these areas will be critical to improve social interaction, especially for adolescents. Intervention is best provided in conjunction with the classroom teacher to improve communication skills in the academic setting and should include community needs as well(24)Improved social interaction is critical to promote peer interaction and improve behavior that may interfere with academic or social skillsNo specific home program is specified. However, a home program should involve the family and relevant activities in the home environment to be individually determined  Decreased expressive languageImprove expressive language skills to within functional limitsLanguage therapy _ Focuses on developmentally appropriate activities to promote expressive language skills specific to the patient\u2019s ability level. Expressive language can be targeted through play, activities relating to daily activities, and academic needs. Therapy focusing on phonological awareness and improving preliteracy skills is critical to improve reading and spelling.(21) SLPs need to incorporate life skills, as well as academic needs. Intervention must include the classroom setting and incorporate the community. During middle school, addressing high- risk behaviors, such as alcohol and drug use, in the context of treatment is critical because children with FAS currently account for 40% of the juveniles in correctional facilities(24)Improved expressive language skills will assist the child to express wants and needs appropriately, increase learning skills and social interactionNo specific home program is specified. However, a home program should involve the family and relevant activities in the home environment to be individually determined  Decreased processing Improve auditory and visual processing to be within functional limitsClassroom accommodations _ Provide education to teachers to promote use of auditory and visual cueing as needed to assist the child. Discuss environmental changes to benefit the child\u2019s ability to process; e.g., sitting near the teacher to best hear or visualize learning materials. Providing repetition will likely help the child in social and academic settings. Encourage the child to ask for repetition and clarification as needed and to write down key words or take notes. Use predictable routines or schedule events in the same order every day.(20) Provide extensive practice and demonstration to assist a child to perform a new task since children with FAS have difficulty learning a new skill.(20) Provide short, simple, one-step commands to increase comprehension, and break down multistep commands(20)Improved processing will assist the child to perform better in academic and social settingsNo specific home program is specified. However, a home program should involve the family and relevant activities in the home environment to be individually determined  Decreased recall Improve recall to be within functional limits for daily needsFunctional training _ Educate the patient and family regarding compensatory strategies such as using lists, timers, verbal rehearsal, and calendars to remember appointments or daily tasks. Research indicates that children with FAS might not be able to use strategies correctly and/or consistently.(22)Giving simple instructions on how to use these strategies is essential, as is monitoring appropriate use of these strategies(22)Improved recall will assist the child to perform better in social and academic settingsNo specific home program is specified. However, a home program should involve the family and relevant activities in the home environment to be individually determined Decreased speech intelligibilityImprove speech intelligibility to be within functional limits.The SLP will target specific sounds or phonological processes based on assessment results. These sounds or processes will be targeted through play activities and drill-type activities that will yield a high number of repetitions of the correct sound to promote improved speech. Also, shaping activities may be used to assist a patient to achieve improved articulation. For detailed information on articulation assessment and intervention, please see Clinical Review\u2026Speech Sound Disorders: Articulation Disorder, Organic ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T708924Improved speech intelligibility will assist the child to communicate more effectively and will promote improved peer interaction and participation in social and academic activitiesNo specific home program is specified.
