            "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a common hereditary neurological disease that causes intellectual disability (ID), as well as physical, behavioral, and sensory deficits.(2) FXS, also known as Martin-Bell  syndrome or Escalante's syndrome, is associated with a mutation of a gene on the X chromosome, thereby affecting males more often and more severely than females.(2) FXS is the most common inherited cause of ID and the second most common genetic cause of ID after Down syndrome.(7) FXS is a congenital disease that does not significantly alter life expectancy; hence, although most patients are initially evaluated during early childhood, it is possible for a patient with FXS to present for speech therapy as an adult(4)"

In order to provide the best possible treatment, the patient\u2019s medical team will attempt to rule out the following diagnoses before making a diagnosis of FXS: Angelman syndrome(5) Prader-Willi  syndrome (PWS)(5) Rett syndrome(5) Sotos syndrome(5)",
        "prognosis": [],
        "referral to other disciplines": "The following referrals might be appropriate for patients with FXS Refer to physical and occupational therapy if the patient has reduced mobility, difficulty with ADLs, or difficulty with sensory integration(7) \u2013Physical and occupational therapy for older patients who present with FXTAS(11) Refer to neurologist if the patient has not already undergone neurological and/or neuropsychological examination(1,7) Refer to ophthalmologist if additional vision problems are noted or reported by the patient and/or caregiver during physical examination(1) Refer to audiologist and/or otolaryngologist if the patient fails the hearing screening and/or appears to have difficulty hearing during the diagnostic audiologic evaluation(1)  Refer to psychiatrist/neurologist/developmental pediatrician for further assessment if ASD is suspected(13) Refer to learning disabilities specialist if parents of a child with FXS report difficulty in school subjects(14) Due to the unique challenges of caring for a child with FXS or FXS with ASD, parents may exhibit depression and/or anxiety(21,22) \u2013Referral to psychiatrist, psychologist, or family counseling might be appropriate if patient\u2019s parents describe difficulty coping with stress, hopeless thoughts, and/or depression \u2013The families of children with FXS experience significant financial and employment burdens; consideration for these burdens and referrals to local and national resources and support programs are often necessary(23)",

        "treatment summary": [
            "In a study conducted in France that compared implicit procedural learning in individuals with FXS or Down syndrome to age-matched, typically developing controls, researchers found that the ability to learn a sequence of 6 blocks implicitly was relatively efficient for the FXS group(24) \u2013Learning decreased as the number of blocks to remember increased(24) \u2013Researchers recommended attempting to use intact implicit learning (cognitive) skills and procedures to teach new information to individuals with FXS(24)",
            "Joint engagement \u2013In a study conducted in the United States with 28 toddlers with FXS and their mothers, researchers investigated the amount of time the dyads participated in joint engagement activities. Joint engagement with a caregiver around an object is considered coordinated joint engagement if the child and caregiver are attending to the same object and they are both mutually involved. In supported joint engagement they are both attending, but the child is not actively responding to the caregiver about the object. In the study, the toddlers with FXS spent more overall time in supported joint engagement compared to coordinated joint engagement. Researchers found that more time spent in coordinated joint engagement was associated with higher language abilities in these toddlers with FXS. Researchers concluded that early intervention programs targeting increased coordinated joint engagement might lead to increased language abilities in children with FXS over time(48)",
            "Maternal responsivity \u2013Maternal responsivity is defined as a \u201chealthy, growth-producing  relationship characterized by warmth, nurturance, and stability as well as specific behaviors, such as contingent positive responses to child initiations.\u201d(38) With respect to language development, high levels of maternal responsivity would be characterized by the mother of a child using frequent verbal input, responding to the child\u2019s intentional communication attempts (e.g., imitations, expansion), and following the child\u2019s interests (e.g., the child picks up a train and the mother states, \u201cLook! You\u2019re going to play with that train!\u201d(38) \u2013In a study conducted in the United States with 55 mother-child  dyads, researchers investigated the relationship between maternal responsivity and child vocabulary development in children with FXS. Communication interactions between the mothers and their children were observed and coded over the course of 7 years. At the start of the study, the children ranged in age from 11 months to 4 years old. Researchers found that sustained maternal responsivity over time was a significant predictor of the number of different words in the child\u2019s vocabulary at age 8. Although this was not an intervention study, the researchers discussed the implications for intervention. Because prior intervention studies have shown that parents can be taught to be more responsive, parent training in responsivity might improve vocabulary development in children with FXS(38) .
