            "Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) is a collective term for clinical problems that are characterized by chronic or fluctuating orofacial pain related to internal derangement and/or articular dysfunction of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), masticatory muscles, and closely related structures. Physical examination often reveals reduced mouth opening, increased tension in muscles of mastication (i.e., masseter, anterior temporalis, and pterygoids) and TMJ crepitus or a clicking noise in patients with TMD(1,5,16)",
            "15% to 25% of the population will experience TMD at some point in their lives(15)",
            "Surgical treatment for TMD is rare and only considered when conservative treatment has failed. Patients with disc displacement without reduction may undergo arthroscopy or a total joint replacementto decrease pain and improve function. Moderate evidence indicates that a variety of nonoperative treatments (i.e., patient education, behavior modification, biofeedback, physical therapy, pharmacotherapy, occlusal therapy [oral appliances/splints], acupuncture, and cognitive behavioral therapy) are effective for relief of pain and muscle tension, and for improving masticatory function(1)",
            "Physical therapy typically involves superficial heat, ultrasound, soft-tissue  work, jaw exercises, biofeedback, cervical posture training, and patient education(15,23)"
