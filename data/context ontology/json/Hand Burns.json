Changes in the bulkiness of the bandages will alter the fit of the orthosis -Children can tolerate longer immobilization than adults because of the elasticity in their joints. It is important not to over-immobilize  the joints, which can result in joint stiffness, contractures, and soft tissue adhesions.
