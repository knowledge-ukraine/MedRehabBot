SCATS values showed significant reductions at 1 hourfollowing TENS and 4 hours following FES -These findings suggest that both TENS and FES can be used as a therapeutic adjunct to relieve spasticity \u2013TENS was found to reduce lower-extremity  spasticity in hemiplegic patients(35) -TENS group consisted of 27 patients with spasticity (at least grade 1 on Ashworth Scale) after acute cerebrovascular accident. Control group consisted of 24 healthy persons who did not receive TENS -EMG studies were taken before and after TENS treatment in both groups -Primary outcome measures were the Brunnstrom stage, Ashworth Scale, and 10-meter  walk time -Treatment was a single session of TENS for 30 minutes with electrodes placed on the tibialis nerve. Frequency and duration were set at 50 Hz and 100 msec, respectively, with amplitude not exceeding 50mA -A significant decrease in spasticity levels and an increase in walking speed were found in the TENS group \u2013Authors of an RCT (N = 16 patients with subacute traumatic SCI and spasticity) in Myanmar found that addition of TENS to standard physical therapy reduced spinal spasticity(28) -Patients reported plantar flexor spasticity as painful or limited their daily activity -Participants were randomized to an experimental group that received TENS before physical therapy or to a control group that received conventional physical therapy only -TENS was applied in 60-minute  sessions over the bilateral common peroneal nerve with the patient in a supine position, followed by 30 minutes of physical therapy every weekday for 3 weeks -The control group received the same physical therapy for 30 minutes every weekday for 3 weeks -The primary outcome measure was the composite spasticity score derived from summation of ankle jerk score, muscle tone score, and ankle clonus score -The TENS and physical therapy group had a greater reduction in clinical spasticity over both the immediate and shortterm (3 weeks) than the control group \u2013Authors of an RCT (N = 52 patients with SCI and central pain) in China found that TENS effectively decreased pain(29) -Participants were randomized into an experimental group treated with TENS for 20 minutes 3 times a week for 12 weeks or a control group that received sham TENS for the same amount of time -The primary outcome measure was the MPQ -Results indicated that TENS treatment was more effective for relieving pain than sham TENS",
            "Wound care \u2013Authors of a pilot study (N = 23 inpatients with open wounds) in the United States found that high-intensity  TENS was effective for reducing pain associated with wound care procedures(30) -Participants rated pain intensity during their first dressing change on a numeric scale of 0 to 10  -High-intensity  TENS was applied using 4 square electrodes placed on the top and bottom and both sides of the wound beyond the border of the dressing 30 minutes prior to the dressing change. The amplitude was increased every 5 minutes until the dressing change began and then once during the dressing change to achieve and maintain the strongest tolerable sensation during the wound care procedure -The high-intensity  TENS significantly reduced pain by a mean of 2.0 on the numeric scale. The effect was clinically significant for subjects with severe pain during the first dressing change, but not for subjects with moderate pain",
            "TMD \u2013Authors of a 2014 systematic review found evidence was lacking to recommend TENS for treating TMD(19) \u2013Authors of a 2014 RCT (N = 40 patients with TMD) in India found that TENS was an effective adjuvant modality in the management of TMD pain(31) -Participants were randomly assigned to a group treated with medication alone (analgesics and muscle relaxants) or to a group receiving TENS therapy in combination with medications -Pain was measured using the V AS -Results -Significant reductions in pain were found in both groups -The TENS with medications group had a greater reduction in pain than the medications-only  group \u2013Authors of study (N = 60) compared the effectiveness of TENS and microcurrent nerve stimulation (MENS)in the management of masticatory muscle pain. Patients received either TENS or MENS for 20 minutes a day for 5 consecutive days(46) -TENS and MENS were equally effective in improving functional mouth opening -MENS showed a greater and more immediate effect in pain relief -Both TENS and MENS can be used to effectively treat chronic masticatory muscle pain and decreased functional mouth opening",
            "Phantom limb pain(16) \u2013Authors of a review found evidence was lacking to support the use of TENS to treat phantom limb and stump pain",
            "Acupressure-like  TENS was found to increase the pain threshold of cold-induced  pain when electrodes are placed on the TE5 (Waiguan) and PC6 (Neiguan) acupoints(33) \u201348 patients were divided into three groups: TENS with electrodes of 1 cm2 area, TENS with electrodes of 15 cm2 area, or placebo group \u2013Study consisted of three phases: cold-induced  pain without TENS, cold-induced pain with TENS or placebo, cold-induced pain post-TENS \u2013Pain was measured using the V AS \u2013Results: the group that received acupressure-like  TENS had a greater cold-induced  pain threshold than the placebo group",
