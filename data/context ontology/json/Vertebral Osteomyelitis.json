            "Osteomyelitis is an infection, usually bacterial, of bone. It is characterized by inflammation, progressive necrosis and destruction, and sequestra (i.e., segments of necrotic bone separated from living bone by granulation tissue). The infection may involve the periosteum, cortex, and metaphysis, as well as surrounding soft tissue(1,14)",
            "In the acute stage, medical therapy is guided by the results of surgical debridement and bone cultures(1,2)",
            "Antibiotic treatment usually resolves uncomplicated cases of focal osteomyelitis in about 4 to 6 weeks, without recurrence. Recalcitrant cases may require hyperbaric medicine, limb salvage, or amputation(2,3)",
            "Infected fracture or surgical prothesis, vascular insufficiency, diabetes, neuropathy, and compromised immunity are associated with chronic osteomyelitis and amputation. In such cases, aggressive surgery (bone stabilization/reconstruction and muscle flap coverage) is required to improve the functional outcome(3,4)",
            "Patients with resolved osteomyelitis may present for rehabilitation services with impairments that reduce physical functioning(1) \u2013Restricted movement of the involved extremity or spine \u2013Reduced ability to bear weight \u2013Pain/tenderness of involved site \u2013Motor/sensory deficits"

Authors of a case study report successfully treating a 26year-old female with chronic osteomyelitis. It is an alternative to traditional autologous bone graftingthat uses fat as a deadspace  filler, however more studies are recommended on this method(18) There is limited evidence regarding adjunctive therapies such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy and negative pressure wound therapy. However, hyperbaric oxygen therapy used in combination with antibiotics and/or surgical debridement has been associated with high recovery rates(13) Authors of a systematic review of the literature on the effectiveness of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in conjunction with antibiotic treatment and surgical debridement foundthat the available evidence may support a beneficial role of adjunctive hyperbaric oxygen, especially in refractory cases of chronic osteomyelitis(19)",

Problem Goal Intervention Expected Progression Home Program  Gait, balance, and functional mobility impairments resulting from immobilization and weight-bearing restrictionsImprove gait, balance, and functional mobility while ensuring the patient maintains immobilization and weight-bearing restrictions through use of appropriate assistive devices and gait patternsGait training _ Patients should be educated and trained in the use of appropriate assistive devices (walker, crutches). This training will also include instruction and practice in appropriate gait patterns to maintain weight- bearing restrictions _ _ Stair training with appropriate patterns and assistive devices should also be included for patients who need to navigate stairs to enter/ exit their homeBalance activities _ Standing balance activities may be utilized to increase static and dynamic balance. These may be conducted in single- limb stance or sitting if the patient is non- weight-bearing on the involved extremity. Appropriate guarding and gait belt should be utilized, as indicated _ _ Reaching, catching, balloon tapping, and manual resistance activities may be used. _ Gradual resumption of participation in athletic activities may occur after antibiotic treatment(6)A home exercise program to complement the physical therapy exercise program should be progressed as the patient moves through phases of healing  Decreased strength and ROMImproved strength and ROMStrengthening exercises _ Seated strengthening exercises for the proximal musculature may be utilized to assist in maintaining non- weight-bearing status while standing and ambulating for patients with lower extremity involvement _ Progressive strengthening exercises using cuff weights, resistance bands, or manual resistance _ _ Lower extremity strength may be addressed using a comprehensive global strengthening program. Standing exercises may be used as appropriate, with sufficient support provided by assistive device (walker) or parallel bars _ _ Observe weight- bearing restrictions, immobilization, and any other restrictions per physician orders. _ Upper extremity weakness can be addressed with free weights, resistance bands, or manual resisted exercises to improve the use of assistive devices and allow the patient to adhere more easily to weight-bearing restrictions of the lower extremity. _ Core strengthening for patients with spinal involvementProgress based on the individual patient needs; consider the patient\u2019s age, physical impairments, and cognitionPatients may perform a global strengthening program of the unaffected areas as appropriate and within the limitations of physician restrictions to prevent muscle strength loss and facilitate increased ease of ambulation  Unhealed wound(s) Healed wound(s) Wound care _ In some cases, therapists may be expected to perform dressing changes, apply topical antibiotic or other medications, perform dull or sharp debridement, and provide management of a \u201cwound vac\u201d systemN/A Instruction in signs of localized/systemic infection and wound care, as appropriate ."
