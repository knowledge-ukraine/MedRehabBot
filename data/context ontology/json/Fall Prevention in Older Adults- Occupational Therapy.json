            "The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends selectively offering multifactorial interventions to prevent falls in community-dwelling  adults \u2265 65 years old(45) \u2013Interventions may include targeted combinations of any of the following components: exercise, psychological interventions, nutrition therapy, falls-risk  education, medication management, urinary incontinence management, environmental modifications, and referrals to therapy, social services, or specialists \u2013Specificcomponents of multifactorial interventions that are particularly efficacious for prevention of falls are reportedly difficult to identify due to the heterogeneity of such interventions",
            "There is \u201cmoderate to strong\u201d evidence to support OT interventions for falls prevention. Types of interventions supported by the evidence include the following:(27) \u2013Interventions that address many risk factors (i.e., \u201cmulticomponent or multifactorial interventions\u201d) \u2013Home assessment followed by appropriate home modifications for patients who have a history of falling \u2013Provision of adaptive equipment and home modifications aimed at decreasing functional decline and improving safety \u2013Promoting physical activity of all types \u2013Home modification for patients \u201caging with disabilities\u201d to decrease \u201cperceived difficulty with ADLs and IADLs\u201d",
            "Authors of a systematic review investigated whether single intervention (SI), multifactorial interventions (MI), or multicomponent interventions (MCI) including vitamin D supplementation prevent falls and decrease fall-risk  factors in older adults who are community dwelling or living in long-term  care facilities(50) \u2013Single interventions included only exercise programs. MI interventions combined exercise and other individualized treatments. MCI interventionscombined a fixed program including exercise and other components  \u2013Thirty-four  studies (13 RCTs and 21 systematic reviews) were included.Of20 studies that had an outcome measure for falls rate, a significant reduction in falls was found in 15. Of 23 studies with outcome measures on fall risk factors, a significant reduction in falls was found in 17 \u2013Results were inconclusive regarding which type of intervention was best, but exercise was part of each intervention \u2013In regard to vitamin D supplementation, the authors concluded that patients\u2019 baseline vitamin D concentrations should be considered as adequate vitamin D levels may contribute to musculoskeletal health",
            "Exercise/functional training",
            "Exercise programs should target a patient\u2019s specific deficits and fall-risk  factors",
            "The American Geriatrics Society/British Geriatrics Society 2010 recommendations for older community-dwelling  adults who are at risk for fallinginclude offering an exercise program that incorporates balance, gait, and strength training; flexibility; and endurance, but not as sole components of a program(52)",
            "Based on a 2019 Cochrane review, exercise reduces the number of falls over time by 23% in older community-dwelling persons. Exercise interventions involved various types of exercise, and most were multicomponent. Most programs included balance and functional training. Group-based  interventions and individual interventions were both effective, so which type is recommended may be based on the individual\u2019s preferences(46) \u2013An update to the 2019 Cochrane review was conducted with the intent to inform the WHO guidelines on physical activity and sedentary behavior(47) -116 studies were included, 9 of which were published after the 2019 Cochrane review -Exercise reduced the rate of falls by 23% -Programs that included balance and functional exercise reduced the rate of falls by 24% -Programs that included multiple types of exercise (most commonly balance, functional training, and resistance exercises) reduced the rate of falls by 28% -Tai chi reduced the rate of falls by 23% -Programs that were 3+ hours per week and included balance and functional exercises reduced the rate of falls by 42% -The authors concluded that given the high certainty of evidence, effective exercise programs should be implementedfor community-dwelling  persons \u2265 65 years old \u2013Researchers from Singapore conducted a systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness of perturbation training on preventing falls. Perturbation training involves unexpected external perturbations during walking(36) -They found that perturbation training was effective compared to no treatment in reducing laboratory-induced  falls in older and younger persons.The benefits of this training may be realized quickly, can be long-lived,  and are generalizable -They also found that the efficacy of perturbation training in reducing the incidence of community falls in frail older persons is uncertain \u2013In a study conducted in Australia with 32 community-dwelling older adults (ages 65 to 92), researchers found that a balance-specific  exercise program decreased overall fall risk but did not improve total physical functionality(19) -Subjects in this study were divided into two groups: a wobble-board  (balance board) intervention group and a control group -At the conclusion of the study, researchers found that the intervention group had a significant decrease in fall risk as measured by the Physiological Profile Assessment, but the control group did not. Neither group exhibited a change on the Continuous Scale Physical Functional Performance\u201310  (CS-PFP10) \u2013In a prospective RCT conducted in Sweden with 59 community-dwelling  older adults, researchers randomized 38 adults to a task-specific  balance training intervention group and 21 to a control group(24) -The intervention lasted for 12 weeks and consisted of three 45-minute  sessions per week carried out in groups of 6 or 7 participants; each session comprised progressive, task-specific,  individually tailored balance exercises -Participants in the control group were asked to continue the same activity level as before throughout the 12 weeks of the trial and were offered the same training program after the study was concluded -At the conclusion of the 12 weeks, the intervention group exhibited significant improvement in overall function as well as basic and advanced lower extremity function compared to the control group as measured by the Late Life Function and Disability Instrument. Additionally, the intervention group reported reduced fear of falling after completing the program \u2013In a study conducted in France with 706 women between 75 and 85 years of age, researchers assessed the impact of weekly supervised balance training group treatment on rate of falls causing moderate or severe injuries. The balance training in the treatment group was provided over 2 years. The control group received no treatment. There were  significantly fewer falls and lower severity of falls in the group receiving balance training compared to the control group. The balance training group also had better performance on both balance and gait assessments compared to the control group(30) \u2013Authors of a systematic review and meta-analysis  assessed the effectiveness of exercise intervention on fall-related fractures in older adults(53) -20 RCTs were included -Follow-up  duration ranged from 6 months to 7 years -The results indicatedthat exercise intervention reduced fall-related  fractures in older adults \u2013Group-based  exercise programs targeting fall prevention (e.g., Stepping On, Otago) -Authors of a 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis compared the effectiveness of a program that combined group and home exercise on fall-risk factors and falls in older community-dwelling  adults compared to a control group of no exercise(49) -18 trials were included -Meta-analysis  showed significant improvements in those in the combined group and home exercise program in 5 times sit to stand test, TUG test, and gait speed. No differences were found between groups in single-leg  stance time -Combined group and home exercisegroup had improved functional performance and falls-related outcomes compared with the no-exercise  control group -Authors of an integrative review investigated the effectiveness of senior dance in the health of older adults(54) -Senior dance is an intervention that is based on folkloric dances from several nations. Its rhythmic moves and amplitude of movements are designed to help increase flexibility, mobility, and agility -Sessions typically last 45\u201360  minutes and take place 2\u20133 times per week for at least 2\u20133months -Seven studies were reviewed -Based on the studies reviewed, the authors recommended senior dance as a method of improving balance, ADL performance, memory, planning, and QOL and decreasing anxiety and fear of falling -In an RCT conducted in Norway, researchers compared the effects of a group-administered  version of the Otago Exercise Program to that of the original home-training  Otago Exercise Program(21) -The Otago Exercise Program was developed in New Zealand specifically to reduce fall risk in community-dwelling older adults. The original program is individually tailored and focuses on balance and strength-training  exercises for the lower extremities -In the study, researchers divided a group of 125 older adults with high fall risk into a group Otago program and an individual home-training Otago program -At the conclusion of the 12-week  intervention, the group-training  participants had significantly more improvement in scores on the Berg Balance Scale, the 30-second  sit-to-stand  test, and physical health subtest of the Short Form-36. Improvement on the TUG test, mental health subtest of the Short Form-36,  and Falls Efficacy Scale\u2014 International did not differ between groups. At a 3-month  post-intervention  follow-up,  the scores in the intervention group were significantly better on the 30-second  sit-to-stand test and TUG test, but not on the Berg Balance Scale -In a study conducted in the United Kingdom with older adults (65+) with high fall risk, researchers randomized 21 individuals to an Otago plus multisensory balance exercise group (10/21) or an Otago plus stretching program (11/21)(23) -All participants participated in modified Otago group exercise classes twice weekly as well as individual in-home sessions that focused on either multisensory balance exercises or stretching exercises -At the conclusion of the 8-week  intervention, the Otago plus multisensory balance exercise group demonstrated significant improvement on the Functional Gait Assessment and Physiological Profile Assessment. Because of the small sample size, researchers were unable to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of one program over the other; however, they concluded that the addition of multisensory balance exercises to the Otago program was feasible for older adults with high fall risk -Matter of Balance(2) -Nine sessions in length; group-based intervention; each session is 2 hours(2) -Developed by an interdisciplinary team at Boston University in the United States(2) -Program has been shown to increase falls self-efficacy  as well as activity levels among community-dwelling  older adults who have self-restricted  activity due to fear of falling(2)  -Stepping On(2) -Seven sessions as well as a home visit and 3-month  follow-up  session(2) -Program developed at the University of Sydney in Australia -Community-based  program that utilizes a small-group  design to increase falls self-efficacy,  encourage behavioral changes, and reduce falls(2)",
            "Home/environmental modifications \u2013The OT should identify environmental risks and make appropriate recommendations for home and/or work environmentalmodifications that will increase safety and prevent falls. Recommendations include(48) -remove clutter/tripping hazards (e.g., papers, books, clothes, shoes) -remove throw rugs -keep items within reach to avoid frequently using a step stool -install stair handrails and bathroom grab bars -use non-slip  mats in the bathtub and shower -improve lighting in home -wear shoes that fit well and with good support inside and outside the home \u2013In an RCT conducted in the United States, researchers found that a tailored home-modification  program delivered by an OT reduced the risk of falls and improved daily activity performance among community-dwelling  adults 65 years or older who have a history of falling, and the effects were maintained for 12 months(32) -Participants (N = 92) had a fall within 6 months and impairment in ADLs and IADLs -Treatment participants received six 90-minute sessions with an OT over 8 weeks that included a tailored home-modification  program comprising changes to the environment, self-management strategies to safely perform daily activities, motivational enhancement strategies to promote client-centeredness,  and shared decision making \u2013In an RCT conducted in Hong Kong, researchers found that one OT visit after a fall was more effective than a well-wishing visit from someone not trained in fall prevention in reducing a future fall at 6 months follow-up(33) -Participants (N = 204) were 65 and older, community-dwelling,  walked with or without an assistive device, and had previously visited an emergency department because of a fall (no more than 2 weeks prior to intervention) -The visit lasted 90 minutes and included a home-safety  assessment and home-modification interventions",
            "Fall-prevention  education \u2013The OT should introduce patients to fall-prevention strategies and implement fall-prevention  strategy training -Cognitive modifications(2) -Increasing thought processes such as reflection, intention, and planning at all times (e.g., noticing subtle changes in balance, one\u2019s own level of alertness, side effects of new medications)(2) -Protective mobility(2) -Navigating the environment in an accommodating or protective way (e.g., using defensive walking strategies such as walking away from a crowd)(2) -Avoidance(2) -Avoiding risky situations with high likelihood of falling (e.g., do not use the bus during rush hour) -Increased awareness(2) -Training the patient to notice hazards, such as spills on the floor, and to scan ahead when walking to look for potential obstacles(2) -Pace(2) -Using an appropriately slow walking pace(2) -Limiting the need to rush from one place to another by allowing enough time for travel/walking -Problem-solving  strategies(2) -Predicting problems and finding safe solutions (e.g., using a sturdy, wide-based  stepladder for climbing instead of a chair)(2) \u2013Assess patient\u2019s confidence in these strategies(2) -If the patient does not believe a strategy will be effective, he or she is less likely to use the strategy(2)  \u2013Educate patient and caregivers on proper transfer training \u2013Make recommendations for assistive and adaptive devices as deemed necessary. Educate on proper use of equipment \u2013Address patient\u2019s fear of falling -Increasing falls self-efficacy  and reducing fear of falling may also help to prevent falls(31)",
            "Fall prevention in special populations \u2013Authors of a systematic review and meta-analysis  investigated the effect of balance training on falls in patients with osteoporosis(51) -Six RCTs were included in the systematic review and three in the meta-analysis -Balance training interventions significantly reduced the frequency of falls compared to control groups -There was no significant difference between the results of trained patients\u2019 Berg Balance test or TUG test scores compared to controls -Balance training may decrease the frequency of falls in patients with osteoporosis \u2013Researchers in the United States conducted a systematic review to determine the effectiveness of environment-based interventions that address behavior, perception, and falls in persons with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and related neurocognitive disorders(34) -Regarding fall prevention, researchers found insufficient evidence to suggest that environmental modifications alone were effective in reducing falls, but preliminary evidence suggests a positive effect when combined with exercise and many occupational therapy interventions to address behavior, perception and falls -Strong evidence supports the use of night monitoring systems (e.g., bed alarms) to reduce falls at home, but these same systems did not lead to a significant reduction in falls or injuries in nursing homes -Limited evidence is available to support the use of noise reduction and low ambient background music to reduce falls and injuries in nursing homes \u2013Researchers from the United States conducted a review of the evidence regarding community-based  falls prevention interventions that seem to be inclusive of and/or accessible to individuals with low vision(35) -Regarding fall prevention, they found that multicomponent interventions did not have a significant effect on fall rate; home modifications studies did show significantly reduced falls; tai chi with and without education did reduce falls -Researchers concluded that fall-prevention  research involving individuals with vision impairment is limited and the intervention strategies for adults with permanent vision loss may not be effective -.

        "In a study conducted in Australia, researchers investigated if there was a lower fall risk associated with participation in specific sports. Researchers used a population-based  cohort of 1,667 men (average age 76.8 years) from the Concord Health and Ageing in Men Project (CHAMP) between 2005 and 2011. Researchers gathered information about falls in this group with 12 triannual phone calls to each participant. According to their analysis, men who were golfers or swimmers had significantly lower risks of falling than men who did not participate in these sports regularly. After adjusting for leisure-time physical activity, walking, lifestyle physical activity score (e.g., chores, gardening), and overall risk factors for falling, researchers found that swimming was the only sport that was associated with a protective effect in this cohort of men(22)",
        "In a pilot research study conducted in Australia designed to assess if disease management plans that include OT and PT will reduce falls in an older adult population, investigators found that the interventions were effective in decreasing falls(25) Occupational therapy intervention included 2\u20133 home visits Westmead Home Safety Assessment, FaB, Otago Exercise Program were used for assessment From the assessment a home and community safety plan and recommendations for home modifications were made as well as adjustments to the exercise program Final therapy visit (either OT or PT) included ensuring that the home modifications and safety recommendations were implemented",
        "Authors of a systematic review and meta-analysis  reported that participation in a falls-prevention  program results in improvement in older adults\u2019 participation in daily occupations. In this review, researchers found five studies (published between 1990 and 2012) that met inclusion criteria; all studies were RCTs with adults over 65 years of age. Overall, the effect size of the participation increase was small; however, researchers concluded that participation in a falls-prevention program after being discharged from the hospital or the emergency department for a fall does improve participation in ADLs(20)"
