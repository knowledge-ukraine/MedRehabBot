        "treatment summary": [
            "PFMT, also known as Kegel exercises, is generally recognized as safe and effective for improving mild to moderate cases of urinary incontinence during the first 6 months after prostatectomy based on RCTs(4,6,16,17,21,22,23,27) \u2013Ninety five percent of patients who started PFMT early (after removal of the catheter or before hospital discharge) were continent at 6 months compared to 65% of patients in the control group, who did not receive postoperative PFMT(16) \u2013In an RCT (N = 206) conducted in Canada, investigators found that verbal and written instruction for PFMT at home with telephone support was as effective as therapist-directed PFMT with biofeedback (once per week, 4 weeks).(17) No differences were found in the percentage of patients continent at 8 weeks (23% of home controls vs. 20% of treatment group), 28 weeks (50% vs. 47%), or 52 weeks (64% and 60%). The results of this study suggest that more intensive PFMT and follow-up  testing should accompany a primarily home-based  program(17) \u2013Support group attendance may improve outcomes after PFMT, based on a small RCT (N = 29) in the United States.(21) The authors found self-assessed urinary continence and quality of life were higher in the group that attended 6 biweekly support group meetings after PFMT compared to the control group, which was assigned to a home program without support after PFMT(21) \u2013Instruction of pelvic floor exercises with hands-on  cueing followed by unsupervised training may be as effective as PFMT with biofeedback. Intensive verbal instruction with examiner feedback on pelvic floor performance administered before PFMT was associated with a similar continence rate at 6 months after prostatectomy as PFMT with ongoing conventional biofeedback.(22) This study did not include a no-treatment  control group \u2013In contrast to the above studies, 2 parallel RCTs in the United Kingdom found that the rate of continuing PUI at 12 months was not significantly different between the 2 intervention groups that received 4 sessions of PFMT over a period of 3 months and the 2 control groups that received standard care or lifestyle advice only(23) \u2013Example of verbal instructions for pelvic-floor  muscle training(20) -\u201cIf you can stop the flow of urine in midstream, you are squeezing the correct muscles. Imagine you are trying to stop yourself from passing gas. Squeeze the muscle around the rectum. The rectal muscle should move, but the buttocks, thighs, and stomach should stay relaxed. These (other) muscles should not move at all. You should feel and see the base of your penis twitch and contract inwards. Squeeze firmly (and hold) for 5 to 10 seconds. Relax for 10 to 20 seconds. Repeat the contractions 12 to 20 times. Perform the exercises 3 times a day\u201d",
            "Functional electrical stimulation (FES) \u2013Investigators compared PFMT with FES using anal surface electrodes (27 Hz, biphasic, 1-sec  bursts, 5-sec  pulse width, 2-sec  pulse trains, intensity controlled by patient from 10% to 100%) to PFMT alone and to PFMT in conjunction with biofeedback in an RCT (N = 139) in Germany.(24) FES was performed for 15 minutes twice daily and commenced at catheter removal. No significant differences in results of the continence rate (24-hour  Pad Test) were found among the 3 groups at 3 and 12 months follow-up,  suggesting that FES is not cost-effective.(24) This RCT did not include a no-treatment  control group \u2013In an RCT (N = 60) in Italy, the authors observed that twice weekly FES sessions (anal surface electrode, pulsed at 30 Hz for 10 min and then at 50 Hz for 10 min; 300 microsecond pulse duration, max intensity 24 mA) preceded by biofeedback (15 min) from 1 to 7 weeks post prostatectomy significantly increased the percentage of patients achieving continence (24-hourPad  Test) at 4 weeks and 6 months compared to the control group, which received standard instructions for home PFMT.(25) Unfortunately, the independent effect of FES was not determined because it was combined with biofeedback ",
            "Extracorporeal magnetic innervation (ExMI) \u2013In a small RCT (N = 36) in Japan, investigators compared patients receiving FES (n = 12) or ExMI (n = 12) to controls (n = 12) assigned to PFMT at home after receiving verbal instruction with digital rectal feedback.(26) ExMI consisted of twice weekly sessions for 2 months using a pulse field of 10 Hz intermittently for 10 minutes followed by 50 Hz intermittently for 10 minutes at the highest tolerated intensity. Patients sat on a magnetic coil with the perineum positioned over the center of the coil. FES was applied with an anal electrode at pulses of 20-Hz  square waves with a 300-microsec  pulse duration for 15 minutes twice daily for 1 month. Continence was assessed by 24-h pad weights. ExMI significantly reduced incontinence at 2 months after surgery compared to PFMT, while 24-h pad weights at 1 and 2 months were not significantly different between FES and ExMI. Interestingly, continence was similar among the 3 groups at 6 months post-surgery.  The authors suggested that FES and ExMI offer earlier recovery for PUI compared to home-based  PFMT(26) \u2013In a small study (N = 40) in Italy comparing PFMT using FES (n = 18) to ExMI (n = 22) for treating PUI, authors found no significant difference in continence between groups at 6-week  follow-up.  Of note, leakage was reduced after ExMI in 6 patients who had not responded to FES(34)",
            "Behavioral therapy (PFMT plus counseling on bladder control strategies) \u2013Behavioral therapy alone was as effective as behavioral therapy plus FES and biofeedback for decreasing episodes of incontinence in men with PUI persisting more than 1 year(27) -Based on an RCT in the United States with 208 community-dwelling  men (51 to 81 years of age) with incontinence 1 to 17 years after radical prostatectomy -Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups -Behavioral therapy-only  (4 structured visits approximately 2 weeks apart and home exercises 3 times daily) -Behavioral therapy plus in-office  biofeedback using electromyography (EMG) plus daily FES (20 Hz, up to 100 mA) -Delayed treatment (control group) -After 8 weeks of treatment, the reduction in mean incontinence episodes per week was not significantly different between the 2 behavioral therapy groups, while both were significantly reduced more than the controls -Fifty-five  percent reduction in the behavioral therapy-only  group -Fifty-one  percent reduction in the behavioral therapy plus biofeedback and FES group -Twenty-four  percent reduction in control group \u2013Results of a 2013 systematic review indicate that psychoeducational interventions such as education and counseling intended to inform postprostatectomy patients and their caregivers about their disease and their treatment positively influence their disease perception, self-management,  and coping(39) -Four of eight studies included specifically addressed urinary incontinence -Significant effects of psychoeducational interventions were found in some vulnerable groups but not others -Men with preexisting low level of depression were reported to respond positively, but not men with higher levels of depression, thought to be related to their ability to focus on problem-solving",
