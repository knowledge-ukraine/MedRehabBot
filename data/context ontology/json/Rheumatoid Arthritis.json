        "Pain and level of fatigue are barriers that limit a patient\u2019s ability to participate with regular physical activity. Recommendations to overcome these barriers may include:(52) coping strategies to overcome barriers educating patients and increasing their knowledge of the benefits of physical activity providing appropriate exercise programs to patients, caregiver\u2019s, and family members",
        "RA is a chronic and progressive disease that requires lifelong monitoring with continual adjustments to treatment interventions. Due to the fluctuating periods of the disease severity, it is important for these patients to be monitored routinely so any adjustments to treatment interventions can begin as soon as possible, which can help to minimize patients\u2019 pain and functional disabilities. Patients should have routine follow-up  care with their rheumatology care team every 3 to 12 months  Researchers in Denmark conducted a 2-year  randomized study to compare patient outcomes of three follow-up regimens: scheduled follow-up  with a rheumatologist, shared care without scheduled appointments, or planned nursing consultations(42) \u2013Two hundred eighty-seven  patients with Disease Activity Score less than 3.2 and a Health Assessment Disability Index score of less than 2.5 were randomized to the three groups for a 2-year  period \u2013The group who received the nursing consultations significantly increased their self-efficacy,  confidence, and satisfaction compared to the scheduled rheumatologist group \u2013Researchers recommended that a shared care and nursing consultation model as an alternative to only scheduled rheumatology appointments should be considered for patients with low disease activity RA. Nursing consultations can enhance patients\u2019 self-efficacy,  confidence, and overall satisfaction with their care. This regimen allows the patient to become a more active member of the team and assist with symptom self-management",
        "Authors of a research study recommend that patients with RA be physically active despite days of experiencing \u201chigh-fatigue.\u201d  Performing light physical activity such as walking buffered the negative effects of RA and improved mood among adults with OA or RA(51)",
        "An exercise program should be maintained for continued management of symptoms and disease progression with a focus on joint protection, energy conservation, pain management, joint mobility, strength, functional mobility, and aerobic capacity(17)"
