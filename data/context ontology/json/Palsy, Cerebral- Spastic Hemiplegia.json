When spasticity is present in the lower extremities (in one or both legs), it is common to see initial contact with the toes instead of the heel (toe walking)(5) -Observe for vaulting or pronounced hip/knee flexion during gait due to decreased clearance of the foot -Gait deviations also include posterior pelvic rotation and hip flexion on impaired side with absent arm swing as the arm is often held in flexion(24) -Three-Dimensional  Gait Analysis (3-DGA)  is used to assess gait deviations in an objective manner with significant intra-rater  reliability. This type of gait analysis is an accurate evaluation tool that can objectively quantify motor functions in a child with CP. 3-DGA  assesses the severity, extent, and nature of the functional deficits to support treatment decision-making.  A follow-up  analysis after treatments allows for monitoring of the progress objectively and adjustments to the treatment plans as needed.Limitations of 3-DGA include expense and high skill level required to interpret data, but research supports a favorable cost-benefit  ratio for use in CP patients (50) Joint integrity and mobility \u2013In the child with spasticity there is a high risk for contracture development as full ROM is not used; document any contractures -Is the child using bracing throughout the day, or splinting at night? \u2013Assess for crepitus in joints \u2013Document hypermobility in joints using Beighton Scale of Hypermobility Motor function (motor control/tone/learning) (should include Gross Motor Function Measure-88  [GMFM-88]  or short form)scales include Ashworth, Modified Ashworth, and Tardieu(39) \u2013Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) for Cerebral Palsy (33,48) -The most widely used functional classification system for children with CP(39) -Establish child\u2019s level of function on the GMFCS (for children from birth to 12 years) or the expanded GMFCS (for children from birth to 18 years) for Cerebral Palsy -The GMFCS for Cerebral Palsy is a 5-level  system that classifies children with CP based on their motor function ability \u2013The Manual Ability Classification System (MACS) (48)  -Classifies how children with CP use their hands to handle objects in daily activities -Is a 5-level  system based on typical use of their hands and is mainly a descriptive and subjective system \u2013K-means  algorithm -Authors of a 2017 study aimed to develop a more quantitative method of classifying levels of upper limb disability in children with spastic hemiplegia CP based on upper limb movements and muscle activation (41) -The MACSis widely used and is a descriptive and subjective system. The proposed classification method uses quantitative and objective measurements to develop a K-means  algorithm -Authors found that the K-means  algorithm identified four different clusters that related to the MACS levels. The K-means  clustering method may be helpful in future objective-based  research \u2013Motor planning in young persons with hemiplegic CP is impaired(1) -The motor planning difficulties were found to be more significant in individuals with injury to the left hemisphere of the brain -The clinician should observe for signs of difficulty when completing motor tasks and attempt to identify all potential causes of observed limitations. The problems may be more related to motor planning concerns than actual motor limitations. If the child demonstrates impaired execution of activities with the nonaffected arm, a more global motor planning issue is likely \u2013Developmental disuse may occur in a child with hemiplegic CP who has significant sensorimotor impairment. Development of the brain and the motor systems is driven by motor cortex activity. Early diagnosis of CP and then early intervention are essential. Children who do not actively use their motor cortex risk losing cortical connections.

The unilateral CP children demonstrated similar results. There was a positive correlation between a higher score in the mental chronometry task and bilateral activations of intraparietal sulcus, and to activation of contralesional, right dorsal premotor cortex, and putamen during imagination of grasping movements -Study authors concluded that explicit MI ability for grasping actions could be preserved in children with unilateral CP. The use of explicit MI training to improve patients\u2019 upper limb motor functions may be possible",
            "Treadmill training with additional ankle loading (45) \u2013Authors of a 2019 study assessed the immediate effects of a single treadmill training with additional lower limb loading on kinematic gait parameters in 20 children with hemiparetic CP (45) -Gait in children with hemiparetic CP often is characterized by reduced dorsiflexion and knee and hip range of flexion/ extension. This results in reduced speed, shorter step length, increased base support, and longer stance time in nonparetic limb -The treatment consisted of treadmill gait training for 12 minutes. For the first 3 minutes the child walked with no load. Kinematic data were collected for the pre-treatment  phase. A load of 60% of each patient\u2019s lower limb was calculated and then added to both ankles. The patient continued walking for 5 minutes. At the end of this stage the weight was removed from the ankles. The patient returned to the treadmill to walk for 1 minute while the post-treatment  data were collected. After 5 minutes of rest, the patient walked for 3 more minutes with no load. Kinematic data were collected during this final phase -Results demonstrated increase in knee (p = 0.001) and hip (p = 0.005) ROM, maximum knee (p < .0.001) and hip (p = .001) flexion in swing, and paretic foot height during swing (p < 0.001) when pre and post were compared -Children were able to make anticipatory adjustments to additional lower limb loading. Being able to increase the height of the paretic foot by increasing hip and knee flexion, even for a short period of time, enhances gait function. Incorporating this strategy into gait rehabilitation should be considered",
            "Balance training \u2013A small RCT conducted in the Netherlands involving 10 children with spastic hemiplegic CP assessed balance training with visual feedback. Researchers found that the training had a positive impact on quiet (static tasks) and dynamic (weight-shifting  tasks) standing as well as gait in these children(26) -The training sessions were 30 minutes, 3x/week for 6 weeks with static and dynamic challenges -The treatment group demonstrated an increase in anterior-posterior  voluntary weight shifts and weight shifts toward the nonaffected lower extremity -Postural sway appeared to decrease as evidenced by decreased amplitude in the anterior-posterior directions during quiet stance coupled with increased time on the standing target -There was an increase in step length seen when the nonaffected leg was in swing, thereby reducing the asymmetry of gait \u2013Authors of a small noncomparative study conducted in the United States assessed 6 children with CP (4 with spastic diplegia, 2 with spastic hemiplegia) who underwent 5 days of intensive treatment consisting of 100 perturbations/day on a moveable force platform. The following was reported:(27) -In the children with spastic hemiplegia, the start of muscle contraction was slow in the affected leg once perturbations commenced; however, timing improved in certain muscles after training -Prior to training the muscles contracted in a pattern of proximal to distal, opposite of the pattern seen in typical children. However, after training this pattern reversed to the desired outcome of distal-proximal -In addition, in the patients with spastic hemiplegia, an enhancement in the ability to control the amplitude of muscle activity was observed",

The following was reported:(29) -Both treatment groups had significant improvements in gross motor function after the 16-week  treatment regimen according to the GMFM  -The group that underwent intensive (5 days/week) therapy had a greater improvement in function than the group that received NDT 2 days/week (sessions were 50 minutes long in each group)",
            "Orthoses \u2013Orthoses may be indicated for children with spasticity to improve functional mobility, ADLs, pain, and contractures \u2013Ankle-foot  orthoses (AFOs) are frequently prescribed for children with spastic hemiplegia CP. AFOs can help maintain ROM,prevent progressive loss of ROM, prevent contracture, deformity, and pain, preserve ROM gains following other interventions, protect foot and ankle alignment, and improve gait and overall function (42) -Research on AFOs in patients with CPshows an improvement in gait including mechanics, step length, and velocity -The brace should be individualized to the child\u2019s physical impairments and gait pattern -The decision-making  process for AFOs is multidimensional and should include a physical assessment, clear identification of gait impairments and deficits that the AFO is intended to address,and knowledge of the biomechanics of normal gait, the mechanics of gait deviations, and the biomechanical capabilities of different types of orthoses \u2013There are two main types of AFOs, solid and hinged, which are prescribed for different reasons. Solid AFOs limit dorsiflexion and may be better suited for bilateral CP. A hinged AFO allows for dorsiflexion while prohibiting plantarflexion beyond a set position of the ankle and is intended to improve gait function by facilitating heel strike at initial contact, promoting stability in stance phase, and assisting foot lift in swing phase. It can correct spastic equinus, which may impede spastic activation of the posterior calf muscles. The footplate design can help modulate abnormal muscle tone. There are unmodified, flatter footplates or rectified, contoured footplates (47) -Authors of a 2020 explorative study evaluated the muscle activity in children with spastic unilateral CP when walking with two types of hinged AFOs: unmodified, flatter footplate and a rectified, contoured footplate (47) -Results showed an unmodified hinged AFO is the favorable choice based on muscle activity because it facilitates more functional muscle activity while impeding spastic response -Both types of hinged AFOs helped to mitigate spastic activation of the medial gastrocnemius in children with spastic unilateral CP, but they also can inhibit tibialis anterior activation (an undesirable response) -The unmodified, flatter footplate hinged AFO was associated with reduced activity in tibialis anterior for a shorter proportion of swing phase at 8% compared to the AFO with a rectified, contoured footplate at 21%. Deactivation of tibialis anterior in swing phase is an undesirable consequence of AFO use that may impair muscle strength and function over time",
            "Electrotherapeutic modalities \u2013Authors of a systematic literature review on the impact of electrical stimulation (ESTIM) in the CP population concluded that the type and age of patient who would benefit most from ESTIM treatment, as well as the most appropriate treatment parameters, is not yet known(30) -Eighteen articles met the criteria for review -5/12 studies assessing efficacy of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) noted statistically significant changes in strength and motor function; however, the level 1 studies had fewer positive outcomes -2/6 studies assessing the efficacy of threshold electrical stimulation (TES) reported statistically significant changes in strength and motor function \u2013Authors of a randomized trial conducted in the United States involving 24 patients with spastic hemiplegic CP investigated the effect of NMES and dynamic bracing on spasticity in the upper extremities. The following was reported:(31) -The patients were randomly divided into three treatment groups: -Group 1 \u2013 two 30-minute  sessions of NMES/day on antagonist extensors -Group 2 \u2013 two 30-minute  sessions of dynamic bracing/day -Group 3 \u2013 two 30-minute  sessions of dynamic bracing and NMES/day -Only group 3 had statistically significant differences in all three outcome measures (Melbourne assessment, grip strength, posture evaluation), but the significant results were only carried over for 2 months after treatment ceased",
            "Computer-game-assisted  repetitive task practice platform (G-RTP)(40) \u2013Improving upper extremity motor and visual-spatial  processing skills in children with CP requires intense repetitive task practice. Engaging these children in approaches that are fun and motivating helps with adherence and ultimately outcomes.The use of computer/video games in rehabilitation training is an emerging and promising therapy approach  \u2013Authors of a case study examined the feasibility, acceptance, and benefits of G-RTP.
