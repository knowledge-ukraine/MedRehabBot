            "Acquired surface dyslexia is a reading deficit in which the patient presents with relatively good reading ability of regularly spelled words (e.g., mint) but difficulty reading words with irregular spelling that cannot be sounded out (e.g., pint, psychic). The patient is able to apply grapheme-to-phoneme  rules, but does so inadequately and tends to make phonological errors in which the error word sounds  similar to the target word.(1) One explanation for the errors in surface dyslexia is that the patient relies on a sublexical procedure for reading rather than a lexical procedure. This theory assumes a reading model in which there are two main routes for reading.(2) In the lexical route (direct route), the word is recognized by matching it to a corresponding word form in the visual word store. In the phonological route (nonlexical, indirect route), the written word is read by converting graphemes to phonemes. It is hypothesized that patients with surface dyslexia are not able to use the lexical procedure for reading and rely primarily on the phonological route.(1) Comprehension of the word is often influenced by spoken pronunciation. Thus, the patient might exhibit errors in comprehending irregularly spelled words (e.g., \u201cbear\u201d misunderstood as \u201cbeer\u201d) or homophones (words that sound the same but are spelled differently and have different meanings\u2014e.g., \u201cvein\u201d vs. \u201cvain\u201d).(2) Writing ability often is impaired similarly to reading ability, with the patient exhibiting surface dysgraphia, which is difficulty spelling irregular words (e.g., \u201ctough\u201d as \u201ctuff\u201d)(3) Causes, Pathogenesis, & Risk Factors"

The patient practiced reading the words at home using the mnemonic aids. Therapy focused on words with similar spelling but different pronunciation (e.g., bough, rough, through). At baseline, the subject could read 5 out of 24 words. After 2 weeks of therapy, the subject had perfect performance on the words that were trained and showed generalization to untrained words. Performance was maintained on a follow-up  test 1 year later.(34) Authors of a second case study performed with another subject using this technique found similar results, but therapy to improve reading did not generalize to spelling skills (dysgraphia)(3) \u2013Homophone comprehension: A computer program was used to train a subject with surface dyslexia to better distinguish meaning between homophones. Therapy involved sentence completion tasks presented by a computer. The subject was required to select the correct word when presented with six choices: the target word, one homophone, and four phonologically related foils. Over the course of 29 sessions, the subject showed improvement on accuracy and decreased time on answering each sentence. Post-testing showed significant improvement on comprehension of treated and untreated items(35)",
            "Instruction for increasing reading fluency and comprehension \u2013Oral Reading for Language in Aphasia (ORLA): ORLA requires the patient to repeatedly read aloud sentences and short paragraphs, first in unison with the clinician and then independently.(1) The approach is based upon learning principles such as active participation by the learner, repetitive practice, over-learning  of skills, use of meaningful materials, and opportunities for success. Authors of a case study of a subject with deep dyslexia examined the effects of ORLA on oral reading ability. No case studies using this approach have been trialed with persons with surface dyslexia. The treatment included a total of 24 1-hour  sessions over 7 weeks. Results indicated that ORLA was effective in improving oral reading of trained sentences, and improvements in reading comprehension were seen in subtests of the WAB-R  and the RCBA-2(1) .
