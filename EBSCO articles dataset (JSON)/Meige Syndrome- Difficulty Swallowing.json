In the esophageal phase, the openings at the top and bottom of the esophagus move the food or liquid to the stomach by relaxing and tightening.(5)In patients with OMD, the oral phase is usually affected to a greater degree than the pharyngeal phase.(34)Symptoms of dysphagia in patients with OMD primarily are difficulty chewing and preparing the bolus for efficient swallowing(1) Causes, Pathogenesis, & Risk Factors"

The features associated witha wet voice, weak voluntary cough, cough on swallowing, and delayed or prolonged swallow.(13) However, a CSE is unable to detect silent aspiration (aspiration of food or liquid into the lungs without overt signs) and cannot be used to determine the physiologic reason for a cough or a voice quality change. Due to its limitations, a CSE should be used as a complement to other instrumental measures rather than in isolation.(13) If oral intake is considered relatively safe, the patient might be observed swallowing different consistencies of food during the CSE.(11) Cervical auscultation (the use of a stethoscope to assess swallow sounds and airway sounds) and pulse oximetry (oxygen saturation is measured before, during, and after swallowing; decreased saturation during and after swallowing is reported to be associated with aspiration) can be used during trial swallows to better detect penetration/aspiration atCervicalT709101 and Clinical Review\u2026Dysphagia AssessmentT709100. For adults, the CSE might include the following -A comprehensive case history and review of medical records(6) -Assessment of oral structures and motor function. Note the appearance of the oral mucosa (e.g., any inflammation or infection that might affect the oral stage of swallowing) and any pooling of saliva in the oral cavity. An inability to swallow might cause the saliva to pool in the mouth. Evaluate dentition in terms of the presence or absence of dental prostheses, the number and appearance of teeth, and general dental care.(6) Examine the facial, labial, and lingual ROM, speed, and strength. Examine velar elevation -Assessment of speech and vocal quality(6) -Assessment of feeding and mealtime techniques used by patient and caregivers.(6) When possible, conduct the CSE during a typical meal to observe the patient\u2019s skills in coordinating respiration and swallowing in a natural environment.(6) Assess patient\u2019s ability to achieve labial seal and contain bolus. Examine retrieval of different food consistencies from a spoon, cup, and straw -Assessment of the pharyngeal phase using palpation. To assess tongue base function, hyoid motion, and laryngeal motion during a swallow, place one finger under the patient\u2019s chin at the base of the tongue, the next finger on the hyoid bone, the next finger above the larynx, and the next finger below the larynx.(15) As the patient swallows, examine for the presence and extent of laryngeal elevation -Observation of the effects of alterations in posture or other compensatory techniques to improve swallow(6) -Evaluation of the patient\u2019s ability to comprehend instructions and use compensatory strategies(16)In-depth  Bedside SwallowT709064and Clinical Review\u2026Dysphagia AssessmentT709037Several screening protocols have been published to assist the clinician during the CSE -Burke Dysphagia Screening Test (BDST) -Standardized Swallowing Assessment (SSA) -Bedside Swallowing Assessment (BSA) \u2013Assessment scales/checklistsLip, cheek, tongue, and jaw movement are rated during a typical meal.

Provides information on the severity of the swallowing disorder and can be used as an outcome measure(21)VFSS is performed in collaboration with a physician (radiologist or physiatrist) and an SLP or occupational therapist and is used primarily as a diagnostic procedure for dysphagia.(6) Most clinical practices follow the protocol originally described by Logemann.(22) The patient eats and drinks a variety of liquids and solids mixed with barium while images are recorded with videofluorography. All patients should be examined in the lateral and frontal positions to gain information on movements of the swallow and symmetry of bolus flow and pharyngeal wall contraction. The SLP examines for the presence of aspiration and the effectiveness of modifying different food consistencies or of modifying posture.(6) In contrast to the CSE, a VFSS provides critical information on the pharyngeal and esophageal phases of the swallow.(11) Due to the levels of radiation involved, this procedure is not suitable to use frequently to monitor changes.(13) Given the unnatural surroundings, swallowing function observed during a VFSS is not necessarily identical to swallowing function evident at mealtimes.(17) Other variables that might influence swallowing function include anxiety, fatigue, and medications.(23) During the VFSS,(16,23) -Lip closure (ability to contain a liquid bolus) -Lingual elevation (the back of the tongue is slightly elevated) -Tongue-to-palatal  seal -Bolus preparation/mastication -Bolus transport/movement of the tongue (movement of the bolus to the back of the oral cavity) -Initiation of the pharyngeal swallow (swallow should be initiated when the bolus reaches the region of the posterior oral cavity) -Soft palate elevation and retraction -Laryngeal elevation -Anterior hyoid excursion -Laryngeal closure -Pharyngeal contraction -Pharyngoesophageal segment opening -Tongue base retraction -Epiglottic inversion -Esophageal clearanceModified Barium SwallowT709077and Clinical Review\u2026Dysphagia AssessmentT709046FEES is performed to evaluate the anatomy and physiology of the pharynx and the larynx, pharyngeal swallow function, and the patient\u2019s ability to manage secretions as well as ability to swallow foods and liquids.(6) In addition, it can be used to explore a variety of diagnostic interventions such as varying bolus consistency, varying posture, and making use of visual feedback for reinforcement.(24) After the insertion of the endoscope, the patient can self-feed during the evaluation. Food must be light in color to enhance visibility (e.g., milk, puddings, yogurt, bread). FEES is preferred over VFSS when patients have safety issues related to radiation exposure or when they need frequent retesting. In addition, FEES might be less taxing than VFSS for patients who are weak and bedridden.(24) The American Speech-Language-Hearing  Association (ASHA) has published several online documents relevant to the technical aspects of FEES and the qualifications required to perform FEES(25) -For detailed information on FEES and endoscopic examinations for dysphagia, see Clinical Review\u2026Dysphagia",
