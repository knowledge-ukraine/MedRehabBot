            "Breast-conserving  surgical treatment of breast cancer involves removal of the cancer but not the breast itself. The decision to proceed with breast-conserving  surgery can only be made after the cancer is staged \u2013Breast-conserving  surgery has been shown, in several clinical trials, to result in survival rates similar to those for patients who undergo modified radical mastectomy for early (stage I or II) breast cancer(5) \u2013Lumpectomy \u2013 surgeon excises tumor and minimal healthy tissue surrounding lesion; may also include a lymph node dissection(1) \u2013Partial mastectomy or segmental mastectomy \u2013 portion of the breast is removed that encompasses cancerous tissue as well as a margin of tissue surrounding the cancerous area; may also include a lymph node dissection(1) -Technically a lumpectomy is a partial mastectomy, since part of the breast tissue is removed(2) -Quadrantectomy \u2013 type of partial mastectomy in which approximately one quarter of the breast is removed; excision of the tumor and surrounding tissue may include overlying skin and some chest wall fascia and muscle. Local lymph nodes are removed. Axillary dissection may or may not be included \u2013A lumpectomy can be done under local anesthetic if lymph nodes are not being removed. General anesthesia is used for partial or segmental mastectomies or quadrantectomies \u2013Breast-conserving  surgery typically is followed by radiation therapy; this treatment combination is referred to as breast-conserving  therapy (BCT) -Whole-breast  radiation is the standard of care following lumpectomy and is referred to as local BCT when combined with axillary staging with sentinel node biopsy or axillary dissection(4) -However, some experimentation has been done with not including radiation after lumpectomy in patients with stage I and II breast cancer. The 2014 National Comprehensive Cancer Network listed whole-breast radiation after lumpectomy as a stage I recommendation and lumpectomy without radiation as a stageIIB recommendation(5) -Patients for whom radiation therapy is contraindicated (e.g., those who are pregnant) are not ideal candidates for lumpectomy \u2013Lymph node dissection may or may not be required with breast-conserving  surgery"

            "Breast-conserving  surgery in early stages of breast cancer may be chosen rather than mastectomy in order to save the breast \u2013Major advantages are superior cosmetic results and reduced psychological and emotional trauma compared to mastectomy \u2013The vast majority of women with stage I or II breast cancer are good candidates for BCT. Only about 50% of women with stage I or stage II breast cancer have BCT, however, despite evidence that it is a safe and effective alternative to mastectomy(10) -A joint study of the American College of Radiology and the American College of Surgeons found that high mastectomy rates in the United States are the result of inappropriate use of medical selection factors (e.g., tumor size, grade, node status) and a function of demographics(10) \u2013Breast-conserving  surgery is not indicated in the following conditions:(11) -Previous radiation therapy in the breast/chest area -Two or more cancerous areas present within the same breast -Tumor is large relative to a smaller-sized  breast -Connective tissue disease(s) that are sensitive to radiation therapy -Pregnancy at the time of radiation therapy following surgery -Tumor size larger than 2 inches that does not decrease in size following chemotherapy -Residual tumor left from previous breast-conserving surgery "
