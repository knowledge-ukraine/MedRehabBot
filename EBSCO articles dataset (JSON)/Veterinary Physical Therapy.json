            "Animal physical therapy involves using professional assessment and reasoning processes to make functional diagnoses and select appropriate physical interventions or treatments for animals. It is seen as complementary to, but different from, veterinary medicine in that the veterinary approach is to reach a pathoanatomic diagnosis and treat an animal medically or surgically",
            "Physiotherapy treatments are selected to manage sensory and motor impairments for functional improvement and activity-specific performance",
            "Animal rehabilitation originated as a way to help animals recover from surgery, as medical and surgical advances in veterinary medicine led to a demand for better care and more expertise",
            "Physical therapy in veterinary practice still focuses on enhancing surgical recovery and maintaining a comfortable quality of life, but it has grown to include many other types of patients, including older animals with chronic conditions such as arthritis, obese animals with functional limitations, and healthy animals whose owners want them to perform at a higher athletic level",
            "The practice of animal physical therapy requires specialized skills and training that include animal handling, anatomy, physiology, and pathology(1)",
            "Many techniques, treatments, and rehabilitation regimens used on humans have been adapted for use in animals. Preliminary studies have shown promising results(2)",
            "Animal physical therapists are usually licensed physical therapists who want to work with animals, but in some settings veterinarians, veterinary technicians, and physical therapy assistants may also evaluate and treat animals in order to restore and improve functional mobility, strength, and endurance",
            "Recognized qualifications for the practice of physical therapy on animals are not legally defined in many countries(2)",

Results showed significant decreases in thoracic and abdominal girth and a mean weight loss of 18.9% of starting weight(17)  -Exercise included lead walks and underwater treadmill exercise -Session duration and treadmill speed were tailored to the capabilities of the animal -Median distance walked was 0.6 miles per session to start and increased sequentially over the study -Owners attended weekly education lectures on pet health during the course of the study -The weight loss obtained was greater than had been previously reported from caloric restriction or drug therapy, which suggests that including exercise and client education may improve the rate of weight loss -Activity through play has been found most effective for increasing activity in obese cats(2) \u2013Strengthening and endurance exercises should follow the overload principle(18) \u2013Principles of specificity should be applied to a conditioning program(18) -Exercises should be selected based on the animal\u2019s function and activity (e.g., sled dogs should be trained pulling sleds, not swimming) \u2013Adequate rest is required to reduce the risk of overuse injuries(18) \u2013As it has in humans, immobilization has been shown to lead to loss of joint motion in animals(18) -Early protected activity, including exercises promoting joint ROM, may be beneficial(18)",
            "Hydrotherapy \u2013Hydrotherapy includes swimming and the use of underwater treadmills for active assisted exercise(8,19) -Water depth may be varied when using aqua-treadmills to make use of buoyancy to encourage walking without full weight-bearing(8,19) -The quantity of water in the treadmill unit is raised or lowered to accommodate horses or dogs of different sizes and to vary the amount of weight-bearing -Controlled clinical studies are needed. There is minimal research evidence on the effectiveness of hydrotherapy for leg injuries(19) -Increased healing speed has been reported in a case series",
            "Modalities \u2013Physical agent modalities can be used as an adjunctive treatment to reduce swelling, relieve pain, enhance healing, increase muscle strength, and alter the mechanical properties of soft tissues in the rehabilitation of animals(27) \u2013Application of cold can be used for acute soft tissue injuries to reduce inflammation and pain -Cold can be applied in many forms, such as tubs of slush, frozen bandages, and ice massage(8,27) -Studies of the application of cold to reduce body or local tissue temperature have found that prolonged or repeated ice water cooling is the most effective for cooling equine limbs(19) -Studies of the effectiveness of cryotherapy in horses are limited(19) \u2013Cold compresses are effective in reducing soft tissue swelling after ligament repair in dogs(20) -A randomized controlled trial compared use of cold compresses, bandaging, and microcurrent electrical stimulation to reduce postoperative tissue swelling -Use of cold compresses alone or with a bandage, or using microcurrent stimulation with a bandage, were more effective than a bandage alone \u2013More research is needed in dogs to determine the amount and duration of tissue cooling with various forms of cold applications(27) -The recommended method of cold application depends on the therapeutic goal, the stage of healing, and the location and size of the area to be treated \u2013Various heating modalities may be used to increase blood flow, tissue metabolism, and tissue extensibility(19) -Generally gel packs and water baths elevate tissue temperature close to the surface only, with minimal effects more than 1.5-2  cm under the skin(19) -Therapeutic ultrasound is primarily used to produce deeper heating (1.0-3.0  cm depth of penetration with 3.3 MHz US, and 2.0-5.0  cm depth of penetration with 1.0 MHz US)(27) \u2013Therapeutic ultrasound -Therapeutic ultrasound can be used to produce thermal effects such as increased blood flow, decreased pain, and increased flexibility in deep tissue(8,19)  -Studies on the effect of ultrasound on equine tendon healing indicate that treated tendons had better clinical results, less degeneration, and less inflammation than controls(19) -Case studies also report positive results of ultrasound in a variety of musculoskeletal conditions in horses, but no control groups were available(19) -A coupling medium, such as a commercially available coupling gel pad cushion, must be placed between the sound head and the tissue surface(27) \u2013LLLT -There is no evidence for clinical effectiveness of LLLT in horses(19) -In vitro studies have found some thermal effects on cartilage healing(19) -Controlled clinical testing in horses is required \u2013Electrical stimulation can be used for pain control and for muscle strengthening(27) -There are few high-quality  studies of the use of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for pain relief in veterinary medicine(27) -A combination of dietary management and intensive physiotherapy that included TENS was effective for reducing disability in a study that involved obese dogs with osteoarthritis -Pain relief from TENS application in dogs is reported to be greatest immediately after treatment -Further study of use of TENS in dogs is needed to establish its effectiveness and appropriate parameters -Electrical stimulation for muscle strengthening (neuromuscular electrical stimulation [NMES]) has numerous applications in small animals, including to prevent atrophy postoperatively(27) -A muzzle may need to be applied to the animal during the initial treatment. In some cases, tranquilization may be necessary -Most dogs tolerate NMES well, but some may find the sensation unpleasant and vocalize or try to run -The current should be turned up very slowly to allow the dog to get used to the sensation gradually \u2013Electro acupuncture has been reported to be effective for pain relief in animals(21,22,23) -Electro acupuncture can reduce postoperative analgesic requirements in dogs(21) -Based on a randomized controlled trial in Brazil involving 30 dogs undergoing mastectomy -Dogs were randomly assigned to receive morphine, electro acupuncture, or sham treatment -Supplemental morphine was administered if postoperative pain was not sufficiently controlled based on a numerical rating scale that incorporated heart rate, respiration rate, arterial blood pressure, salivation, vocalization, agitation, and response to palpation -A combination of conventional medicine and either electro acupuncture or acupuncture may be beneficial for treatment of intervertebral disc herniation in dogs(22) -Based on a study conducted in South Korea that included 80 paraplegic dogs -The combination of electro acupuncture or acupuncture with conventional medicine was more effective than conventional medicine alone in recovering ambulation, relieving back pain, and decreasing relapse in a retrospective study -Conventional medicine consisted of prednisone therapy \u2013ESWT has been used in horses for treating ligament desmitis, tendinopathies, navicular disease, back pain, osteoarthritis, and stress fractures, and in dogs to treat tendinitis, desmitis, spondylosis, nonunion fractures, and osteoarthritis(16) -The animal typically is sedated for treatment with ESWT",
            "Manual therapy \u2013Most of the current knowledge about equine manual therapy is extrapolated from human techniques and applied to horses \u2013Manual therapy may help in the management of select musculoskeletal injuries in performance horses and in musculoskeletal conditions that are chronic, recurring, or not responding to conventional veterinary care \u2013Manual therapy techniques are considered to produce physiological effects in local tissues, on sensory and motor components of the neuromusculoskeletal system, and at a psychological or behavioral level(14) -Techniques used with horses include therapeutic touch for pain; massage for muscle hypertonicity, soft tissue restriction, and pain; stretching for soft-tissue  restriction and joint stiffness; soft-tissue  mobilization for soft-tissue  restriction and pain; joint mobilization for joint stiffness and pain; and joint manipulation for joint stiffness, pain, and muscle hypertonicity(14)  -In horses, massage therapy has been shown to reduce stress-related  behavior(14) -Joint mobilization typically is applied with oscillatory forces within physiological ROM and graded by the amount of available joint motion used(14) -Tui na , an ancient Chinese form of acupressure, uses techniques of \u201cdredging\u201d or clearing the meridians through grasping, holding, kneading, pressing, pounding, pushing, rolling, and rubbing, to which animals are highly responsive(26) -There are 11 different hand techniques (e.g., Tui Fa, Rou Fa ), similar to massage, each with a subset of at least three different movement patterns, which affect the meridians and specific acupoints -Movement techniques are soothing and repetitive -Manipulation is characterized by application of high-velocity,  low-amplitude  thrusts that move a joint or segment beyond its physiological ROM -Anecdotal and clinical evidence suggests that manipulation is an effective adjunctive treatment for musculoskeletal disorders in horses(14) -Manipulation is thought to be more effective than mobilization for restoring normal joint motion and thus decreasing the risk of reinjury(14) \u2013Both spinal mobilization and spinal manipulation therapy applied to horses have been found to improve spinal flexibility -In a United States study that included 24 actively ridden horses, dorsoventral displacement of the trunk increased after mobilization and manipulation(24) -Spinal mobilization had a delayed effect on increasing flexibility, whereas manipulation had an immediate effect and produced larger increases in displacement",
            "Neurological rehabilitation \u2013Physiotherapy techniques adapted from those used in humans have been reported to be effective in treating animals with neurological disorders -A case report from Finland reported the successful use of physiotherapy to aid recovery of a 2-week-old foal with generalized tetanus(11) -The foal presented in a recumbent position and demonstrated extension and tetany of all four limbs, the head, and the neck when lifted to a standing position. V oluntary movement was not possible due to the tetany and hyperresponsiveness to tactile and auditory stimuli -Physiotherapy goals included reducing sensitivity to stimuli; treating pain resulting from spasticity and spasms; reducing spasticity and inhibiting extensor tone; preventing abnormal positions in limbs and torso; preventing respiratory complications, skin lesions, and secondary trauma from recumbency; achieving normal ROM; and enabling voluntary movement -Treatment included desensitization through touch and movement, positioning, massage and PROM exercises, weight-bearing  with use of standing frame, proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF), stretching, active exercise, respiratory physiotherapy, and manual facilitation techniques -Treatment lasted 6 weeks and was divided into 3 phases: passive phase, assistive phase, and active phase -At 6- and 12-month  follow-up  examinations, the foal had no detectable deficits .
