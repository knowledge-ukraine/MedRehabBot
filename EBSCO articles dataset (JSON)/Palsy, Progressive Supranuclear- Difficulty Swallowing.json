            "Dysphagia refers to an inability to move food and liquids efficiently during the oral, pharyngeal, or esophageal phase of swallowing.(4) The oral phase includes sucking and chewing food and moving the food or liquid into the throat. The pharyngeal phase is the initiation of the swallowing reflex, when the food or liquid is squeezed down the throat and the airway is closed off to prevent aspiration (food or liquid entering the airway) or choking. In the esophageal phase, the openings at the top and bottom of the esophagus move the food or liquid to the stomach by relaxing and tightening.(5) Symptoms of dysphagia in patients with PSP have been noted in all phases of swallowing: coughing, choking, food sticking at the base of the tongue, pocketing of food in the cheeks, aspiration, and abnormalities in esophageal motility.(6) Aspiration pneumonia has been cited as a common cause of death in patients with PSP(6,7)",

Due to its limitations, a BSE should be used as a complement to other instrumental measures rather than in isolation.(16) If oral intake is considered relatively safe, the patient might be observed swallowing different consistencies of food during the BSE.(14) Cervical auscultation (the use of a stethoscope to assess swallow sounds and airway sounds) and pulse oximetry (oxygen saturation is measured before, during, and after swallowing; decreased saturation during and after swallowing is reported to be associated with aspiration)can be used during trial swallows to better detect penetration/aspiration atCervicalT709100. For adults, the BSE might include the following -A comprehensive case history and review of medical records(10) -Assessment of oral structures and motor function. Note the appearance of the oral mucosa (e.g., any inflammation or infection that might affect the oral stage of swallowing) and any pooling of saliva in the oral cavity. An inability to swallow might cause the saliva to pool in the mouth. Evaluate dentition in terms of the presence or absence of dental prostheses, the number and appearance of teeth, and general dental care.(10) Examine the facial, labial, and lingual range of motion, speed, and strength. Examine velar elevation -Assessment of speech and vocal quality(10) -Assessment of feeding and mealtime techniques used by patient and caregivers.(10) When possible, conduct the BSE during a regular meal to observe the patient\u2019s skills in coordinating respiration and swallowing in a natural environment.(10) Assess patient\u2019s ability to achieve labial seal and contain bolus. Examine retrieval of different food consistencies from a spoon, cup, and straw -Assess the pharyngeal phase by using palpation. To assess tongue-based function, hyoid motion, and laryngeal motion during a swallow, place one finger under the patient\u2019s chin at the base of the tongue, the next finger on the hyoid bone, the next finger above the larynx, and the next finger below the larynx.(17) As the patient swallows, examine for the presence and extent of laryngeal elevation -Observe the effects of alterations in posture or other compensatory techniques to improve swallow(10) -Evaluate the patient\u2019s ability to comprehend instructions and use compensatory strategies(18)Several screening protocols have been published to assist the clinician during the BSE -Burke Dysphagia Screening Test (BDST) -Standardized Swallowing Assessment (SSA) -Bedside Swallowing Assessment (BSA) \u2013Assessment scales/checklistsLip, cheek, tongue, and jaw movement are rated during a typical meal. This scale can be used with patients from 1 year of age through adulthood(20)A statistically based protocol for patients who are dependent feeders. Scaled ratings are made for posture, tone, reflexes, general motor control, orofacial structures, orofacial sensory input, orofacial motor control, ventilation, and functional feeding assessment(21)Ratings of lip, jaw, and tongue movement during ingestion of liquids and solid foods. Assessment of sipping from a cup, coughing, gagging, and hypersensitivity associated with feeding and swallowing. A checklist allows for indication of abnormal oral structures, oral reflexes, positioning, diet, utensils and feeding(22)Standardized screening survey that can be used with children from 2 years of age to adults. Assesses body mass index, restrictions in food textures and viscosity, dependence in feeding, and need for special  utensils or positioning. Provides information on the severity of the swallowing disorder and can be used as an outcome measure(23)In-depth  Bedside SwallowT709037VFSS is performed in collaboration with a physician (radiologist or physiatrist) and an SLP or occupational therapist and is used primarily as a diagnostic procedure for dysphagia.(10) Most clinical practices follow the protocol originally described by Logemann.(24) The patient eats and drinks a variety of liquids and solids mixed with barium while images are recorded with videofluorography. All patients should be examined in the lateral and frontal positions to gain information on movements of the swallow and symmetry of bolus flow and pharyngeal wall contraction. The SLP examines for the presence of aspiration and the effectiveness of modifying different food consistencies or of modifying posture.(10) In contrast to the BSE, VFSS provides critical information on the pharyngeal and esophageal phases of the swallow.(14) Due to the levels of radiation involved, this procedure is not suitable to use frequently to monitor changes.(16) Given the unnatural surroundings, swallowing function observed during a VFSS is not necessarily identical to the swallowing function displayed at mealtimes.(19) Other variables that might influence swallowing function include anxiety, fatigue, and medications.(25)(18,25) -Lip closure (ability to contain a liquid bolus) -Lingual elevation (the back of the tongue is slightly elevated) -Tongue-to-palatal  seal -Bolus preparation/mastication -Bolus transport/movement of the tongue (movement of the bolus to the back of the oral cavity) -Initiation of the pharyngeal swallow (swallow should be initiated when the bolus reaches the region of the posterior oral cavity) -Soft palate elevation and retraction -Laryngeal elevation -Anterior hyoid excursion -Laryngeal closure -Pharyngeal contraction -Pharyngoesophageal segment opening -Tongue base retraction -Epiglottic inversion -Esophageal clearanceModified Barium SwallowT709046FEES is performed to evaluate the anatomy and physiology of the pharynx and the larynx, pharyngeal swallow function, and the patient\u2019s ability to manage secretions as well as the ability to swallow foods and liquids.(10) In addition, it can be used to explore a variety of diagnostic interventions such as varying bolus consistency, varying posture, or making use of visual feedback for reinforcement.(26) After the insertion of the endoscope, the patient can self-feed  during the evaluation. Food must be light in color to enhance visibility (e.g., milk, puddings, yogurt, bread). FEES is preferred over VFSS when patients have safety issues related to radiation exposure or need retesting. In addition, FEES is typically less taxing than VFSS for patients who are weak and bedridden.(26) The American Speech-Language-Hearing  Association (ASHA) has published several online documents relevant to the technical aspects of FEES and the qualifications required to perform FEES(27) -For detailed information on endoscopic assessment of swallowing, see the series of Clinical Reviews on this topic \u2013Other instrumental procedures include ultrasonography to observe movement of the structures used for swallowing and surface electromyography to record the electrical activity of the swallowing muscles; however, these procedures are used primarily in research at this time.(10) For detailed information on assessment of swallowing with electromyography,Electromyography ; CINAHL Topic ID Number auscultation by a physical therapist has also been used as an adjunct to a bedside assessment(28) ",

        "diagnosis need for treatment": "Dysphagia diagnosis and management is based upon the results of a comprehensive assessment that is performed by an SLP in collaboration with a transdisciplinary team that might include a dietitian, occupational therapist, physical therapist, respiratory therapist, otolaryngologist, radiologist, social worker, and neurologist.(29) Each discipline will provide specific input and expertise on the patient\u2019s swallowing problems and the treatment plan. The primary concern is to maintain and maximize the patient\u2019s health status.(10) After the evaluation, a decision must be made about the patient\u2019s ability to ingest food and water orally based upon the nature of the disorder and the patient\u2019s ability to make adjustments",

Patient and caregiver depression and frustration might result from altered social habits around eating (e.g., cessation of eating out, inviting friends to meals, longer duration of mealtimes, increased dependency on caregiver). Refer to support groups or counseling when signs of depression are present(30)",

            "Diet modification:  Changing the food and/or liquid consistency of a patient\u2019s diet might assist in improving the safety and efficiency of the swallow as well as reduce fatigue associated with eating. For example, if a patient reports fatigue while chewing, the diet can be changed to mechanical soft texture.(17) If the patient reports aspiration of liquids or difficulty containing the liquid in the oral cavity, the clinician might investigate the used of thickened liquids; however, it cannot be assumed that all patients benefit from thickened liquids.(32) Clinicians should explore all possible intervention options  before recommending thickened liquids, and also ensure (by observing modifications during VFSS), rather than assume, that aspiration is not occurring with thickened liquids(33) \u2013For detailed information on diet modifications for dysphagia treatment, see Clinical Review\u2026Dysphagia: Swallowing Therapy \u2013 Compensatory ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T709081",
            "Postural therapy:  Several postures have been examined to assist in changing the direction of the flow of foods and liquids for patients with dysphagia, including the chin tuck, head back, head rotation, and head tilt. Patients with PSP and dementia might need auditory or visual cues to remember to use postural strategies during mealtimes: \u2013Chin tuck (chin down): The chin down posture serves to narrow the distance between the tongue base and pharyngeal wall and is often effective for patients with tongue-base  disorders. This posture widens the valleculae so that it can more easily capture the bolus during a delay in the pharyngeal swallow and prevent aspiration before swallowing(32) \u2013Head back (chin elevated): This posture is beneficial for patients who have difficulty moving the tongue or generating adequate lingual pressures to move the bolus from the mouth to the pharynx. For additional protection of the airway, patients can hold their breath before lifting the chin (supraglottic swallow)(32) \u2013Head rotation: This position is useful when there is unilateral laryngeal paralysis or pharyngeal wall paresis. The head should be rotated to the side of the damage so that the pharynx is closed on the weak side and the bolus is directed towards the stronger side(32) \u2013Head tilt: Tilting the head towards the stronger side can also direct the bolus down the stronger side. This might be useful for patients who have neurologic damage on one side of their mouth and pharynx(32) \u2013For detailed information on postural changes as dysphagia treatment, see Clinical Review\u2026Dysphagia: Swallowing Therapy \u2013 Compensatory , referenced above",
            "Sensory stimuli:  Changing the taste, volume, temperature, or carbonation of the food or liquid has been used as a way to heighten sensation and assist with delayed oral onset and/or delayed pharyngeal swallow.(17) There is no research on the use of sensory stimuli in patients with PSP, and research is needed to determine its effects(32) \u2013For detailed information on changes to sensory aspects of the bolus for dysphagia treatment, see Clinical Review\u2026 Dysphagia: Swallowing Therapy \u2013Compensatory , referenced above",
            "Swallow maneuvers (voluntary changes in the swallow):  Swallow maneuvers include the supraglottic swallow, the super-supraglottic  swallow, the effortful swallow, and the Mendelsohn maneuver. Research has documented specific changes in the oropharyngeal swallow due to these maneuvers for some patients; however, further research is needed to determine the amount of time that these maneuvers should be used. Patients might not be able to perform maneuvers if they are unable to follow instructions or remember to use the maneuver during each swallow. In addition, these strategies might be contraindicated if the patient fatigues easily \u2013Supraglottic swallow: Breath is held before, during, and after the swallow so that the true vocal folds are closed.(32) This technique might be contraindicated for patients with PSP who have impaired respiratory function(33) \u2013Super-supraglottic  swallow: Breath is held while the patient also swallows with extra effort.(32) This technique might be contraindicated for patients with PSP who have impaired respiratory function(33) \u2013Effortful swallow: Patient contracts the muscles involved in swallowing with great effort(32) \u2013Mendelsohn maneuver: The Mendelsohn maneuver is designed to increase the movement of the larynx and hyoid during the pharyngeal swallow. The patient holds the larynx up by using the muscles of the neck or with the hand \u2013For detailed information on maneuvers in dysphagia treatment, see Clinical Review\u2026Dysphagia: Swallowing Therapy \u2013 Swallow Maneuvers \u2013 an Overview ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T709042 and the series of Clinical Reviews on each specific type of maneuver",
            "Adaptive equipment : Adaptive spoons, cups, and straws might be used to assist with the oral stage of the swallow. For example, if the patient has difficulty achieving a labial seal and cannot drink from a straw, a nonspill cup with a large handle might be useful as a facilitative aid. If anterior leakage continues, spoons can be used to place the liquid more posterior in the mouth.(17) A nonskid mat can stabilize objects on the table(17)",
            "Feeding tubes/enteral feeding:  Patients with severe forms of dysphagia might be unable to take adequate nutrition and hydration by mouth and might require a percutaneous endoscopic gastronomy tube (PEG) or a radiologically inserted gastronomy tube.(34) Tube feeding is indicated in patients who cannot eat or drink enough to maintain sufficient weight and hydration ",
            "Medication: In a pilot study conducted in the United States, researchers investigated the use of physostigmine, a centrally active cholinesterase inhibitor, on swallowing function of patients with PSP. The researchers who conducted the controlled, double-blind  crossover trial did not find any significant improvement in oral motor function or swallow duration(7) . Problem Goal Intervention Expected Progression Home Program Oral and pharyngeal post-deglutitive residueReduce post-deglutitive residueAlternate liquid and solid foods _ To reduce and clear post-deglutitive residue, advise the patient to alternate liquids and solids and take small bitesProgression will vary according to individual learning style and patient goalsPatient will need to use swallowing techniques during all meals  High patient distractibility during mealtimes and low caloric intakeImprove overall patient nutrition and caloric intakeTechniques to optimize hydration and nutrition for patients with PSP and dementia _ Patients with dementia might require more time to complete meals. As a result, they might have a low caloric intake and resulting weight loss. The following recommendations might assist the patient in optimizing nutritional intake during meals:(18) 1.Caregivers should be instructed to assist the patient in maintaining good oral hygiene(18) 2.The patient should have a consistent environment and seat in the dining area for mealtimes 3.The patient might benefit from several small meals a day (e.g., 6 meals) rather than three large meals. There is some evidence that regular snacks might assist the patient in maintaining nutritional status and weight(35) 4.Patient meals should include foods that have strong flavors to maximize sensory input 5.The patient should be encouraged to self- feed if possible. The use of finger-food might increase ability to self-feed for those who have difficulty using utensils(35) 6.Provide pre-cut food for patients who might take overly large bites(35) 7.Distractions and nonfood items should be eliminated from the table during mealtimes. Control noise, light glare, and odor(18,36) 8.Desserts should be kept out of sight until the end of the meal(18) 9.The patient should be provided with food choices and culturally appropriate foods(18) 10.The patient should not have to wait for meals (meals should be provided at specific times)(18) 11.Provide cups with handles that the patient can grasp more easily(36) 12.Calorie-dense breakfasts might help patient to maintain weight(36)Progression will vary according to patient goals; as the patient becomes more independent with these techniques, the SLP can reduce the amount of cueing in a hierarchical mannerPatient\u2019s family or aide will use techniques at mealtimes  Oral and pharyngeal dysphagia due to reduced pharyngeal contraction and reduced tongue motionIngest food and liquids safely (without aspiration)Postural treatment _ Several postures have been examined to assist in changing the direction of the flow of foods and liquids for patients with dysphagia, including the chin tuck, head back, head rotation, and head tilt.
