            "Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a blood clot that results from abnormal coagulation, usually in a lower extremity. The DVT is often isolated in the tibial vein of the calf (i.e., a distal DVT), or more proximally in the popliteal, femoral, or iliofemoral veins (i.e., a proximal DVT or May-Thurner  syndrome)(1,2)",
            "Symptoms of venous phlebitis and claudication due to acute or recent DVT include pain, swelling, heaviness, edema, and skin changes in the affected limb(1)",
            "Physical examination of patients with suspected first-time  DVT lacks specificity and sensitivity. Clinical guidelines are available for the diagnosis according to risk of DVT(1,17)",
            "Conservative management of acute DVT includes optimal anticoagulant therapy (i.e., assessment of coagulation factors), leg compression sleeves, and early-mobilization (versus bed rest)",
            "After optimal anticoagulation is established, a symptom-limited  aerobic exercise(often walking) program may be permitted and therapeutic for ambulatory patients(1,18)",
            "Chronic pain and disability in the affected lower extremity for longer than 3 months indicates the development of post-thrombotic  syndrome (PTS), which in most cases contraindicates all vigorous physical activity(19)",
            "Venous thromboembolism (VTE) refers to embolization of the DVT, often to the lungs (i.e., pulmonary embolism [PE]). VTE is a major complication of DVT that increases morbidity and mortality. This Clinical Review does not cover VTE or PE"

Progressive increases in sport-specific  training intensity can begin, provided the athlete is asymptomatic during sport-related  activity and monitored carefully for recurrence of DVT. Patients should not participate in contact and collision sports until anticoagulation therapy is completed(23) \u2013Authors of an RCT (n = 72) in Sweden found that exercise alone or exercise with ECS did not exacerbate symptoms or increase complications in patients receiving anticoagulation therapy soon after DVT.
