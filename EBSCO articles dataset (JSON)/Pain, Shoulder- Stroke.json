Glenohumeral subluxation is one potential source of shoulder pain that can present alone or together with other problems, and should always be treated early after stroke onset whether painful or not \u2013In a population study, researchers in Australia found no reduction in the incidence of poststroke shoulder pain compared with population studies 7 years earlier, despite increased focus on its prevention(25) -Because the disorder is most common and severe after hospital discharge, improved predictive measures may be necessary to improve identification of patients ",
            "Positioning : There is consensus opinion that proper positioning helps avoid subluxation; however, sustained positioning has not been reported to affect level of pain. \u2013Positioning techniques, such as keeping the affected arm in front of the patient\u2019s body (scapular protraction with slight shoulder flexion) when assisting with bed mobility, or placing the affected arm on a pillow or arm trough, are advocated to avoid repetitive microtrauma",

            "Strapping : Shoulder strapping may be useful to decrease or defer onset of pain \u2013Authors of a 2014 systematic review concluded that there is insufficient evidence of efficacy or inefficacy of shoulder strapping to reduce shoulder impairments after stroke(22) -In general, underpinning theory to inform choice of outcomes was lacking, and high quality studies were scarce -Eight studies involving 340 participants met inclusion criteria -Impairment outcomes measured included -pain severity, pain free movement, days to onset of pain, and pain and disability (Shoulder Pain and Disability Index) -subluxation (clinical and radiological assessment) -active and passive range of movement -upper extremity speed and dexterity -The current evidence base for use of strapping was found inadequate, and the authors noted a need for the development and testing of rationales and potential working mechanisms for strapping methods \u2013Authors of a 2015 systematic review also suggest that the use of adhesive taping poststroke is in need of more rigorous research(23) -Seven shoulder studies were included in the review -Use of rigid adhesive tape might increase the number of pain free days at the shoulder -Evidence for improvement of pain intensity, range of motion, muscle tone, strength or function with taping is inconclusive -There was insufficient evidence to comment on taping\u2019s effect on activity and participation -Future research is needed to compare types, methods and dosage of taping \u2013Strapping may be useful to remind caregivers that the shoulder is at risk for damage from incorrect handling or positioning(37) \u2013Kinesio taping  may reduce pain, improve upper extremity function, and range of motion in patients who have had a stroke(28,36) -Based on a randomized controlled trial of 21 patients randomly assigned to the Kinesio taping group or the sham taping group -Patients in the Kinesio taping group had significantly greater improvement in upper extremity function, range of motion and pain",
            "Therapeutic exercise : A therapeutic approach designed to improve ROM of the hemiplegic shoulder may improve pain \u2013Gentle passive and active assisted ROM exercises with appropriate scapular rotation may be helpful(37) \u2013Aggressive ROM exercises (e.g., pulleys) have been reported to result in an increased incidence of painful shoulder \u2013The association of poststroke shoulder pain with severe paresis suggests that therapeutic strategies designed to improve voluntary motor control should be beneficial for shoulder pain",
            "Electrical stimulation  (35,37) \u2013Authors of a meta-analysis  of 6 randomized controlled trials concluded that electrical stimulation reduces pain, and improves shoulder external rotation and function(35) \u2013Researchers in Taiwan found that EMG-triggered  neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) combined with bilateral arm training was better than transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) with bilateral arm training for reducing hemiplegic shoulder pain(31) -Based on a randomized controlled trial that involved 38 patients with hemiplegic shoulder pain. Patients were randomized to receive EMG-triggered NMES or TENS with bilateral arm training three times a week for 4 weeks  -Pain was assessed with a numerical pain rating scale supplemented with a FACES pain scale and the short form Brief Pain Inventory. Other outcome measures included the upper limb subscale of the Fugl-Meyer,  and pain-free passive ROM -EMG-triggered  NMES with bilateral arm training was associated with lower pain intensity during active and passive shoulder movement, lower worst pain intensity, and greater pain free shoulder abduction and internal rotation"
