            "Olecranon fracture (OF), usually a violent traumatic injury, is usually a two-part  fracture that involves the articular surface and requires internal fixation. Surgical management with tension band wiring (TBW) or plate fixation (PF) helps to prevent joint instability and preserve elbow function(9)",
            "Authors of a 2016 meta-analysis  found that upper extremity outcome measures (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand [DASH] and ROM) were not significantly different between OF patients treated with TBW or PF(10)",
            "Postoperative rehabilitation is generally implemented for the overhead throwing athlete recovering from OF(11)",
            "OFs account for about 7-10%  of the fractures that occur at the elbow in adults(3,9)",
            "There are several different classification systems for OF. These classification systems are based on the fracture\u2019s degree of stability, displacement, and comminution; by the amount of involvement of the articular surface in the olecranon notch; or by the fracture pattern and consideration of the type of internal fixation required \u2013OFs can be classified in the following way by the Mayo classification for a transverse break:(12) -Type I (5% of all fractures) \u2013 nondisplaced -Type II (80\u201385%  of fractures) \u2013 displaced with a stable humeroulnar joint indicating intact ligamentous structures -Type III \u2013 displaced OF with unstable joint and torn collateral ligaments -Types I\u2013III are further divided into A (noncomminuted fracture) and B (comminuted fracture)",

The patient should perform AROM elbow flexion/extension and forearm supination/ pronation _ _ Manual therapy _ (when allowed by physician). PROM to increase elbow flexion and extension ROM. Joint mobilization, as appropriate, to restore proper arthrokinematics. Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) may be used to inhibit the biceps, decrease pain, and gain elbow extension ROMProgress as indicated by patient symptoms and ordered by physicianIncorporate ROM into daily home program regimen  Upper extremity weaknessIncrease muscle strengthTherapeutic exercise _ In cases of conservative management, rest and avoidance of aggravating activities are considered the primary interventions. Strengthening of muscles identified as weak may be performed (if approved by physician), but this activity should be pain- free and should not exacerbate symptoms _ _ Immediately following ORIF, elbow strengthening should not be performed. However, hand/grip strengthening can be performed. The use of therapy putty, hand grips, light hand weights/sticks, rubber bands, resisted clothespins, and other hand therapy equipment may all be incorporated to increase grip strength and pinch strength. Shoulder strengthening may be included. Wrist and forearm strengthening should be avoided immediately postoperativelyGentle triceps strengthening begins 3\u00b04 weeks postoperatively. This can be achieved through light manual resistance or with therapy bands/tubing. The patient should be gradually progressed to resistance training using dumbbells and weight machines. The patient may perform 3 sets of 15, increasing the weight gradually, as tolerated. The exercises should always be pain- free _ _ Strengthening of the other musculature may also begin at this time. Biceps, forearm pronation/supination, and wrist strengthening should all begin with gentle resistance and progress, as tolerated, to increased resistance and weight machines. These exercises should also be pain-free _ _ Dumbbells and therapy tubing may be used for biceps curls, with the patient progressing to weight machines. Forearm pronation/ supination may be addressed using weighted hammers. This exercise may progress to weight on a rope that the patient can hold at chest height and slowly wind to and from the ground using forearm pronation/ supination. Rotator cuff/shoulder girdle weakness and other areas of deficit may also be addressed at this time _ _ Upper body endurance may be addressed using the upper body ergometer. Patient may progress as toleratedIncorporate strengthening activities into home program once approved by physician  Restrictions in daily activities and/or sport(s)Restore prior functional capacity in daily activities and/or sportsFunctional training _ In later phases of treatment, plyometric activities (trampoline medicine ball tossing), closed chain activities (wall push-ups, quadruped activities), and stabilization activities, such as a Bodyblade, may be incorporated. A return to athletics may be anticipated with reintroduction to throwing _ _ ADL retraining may be incorporated as indicated by the patient\u2019s needsReturn to sport Include functional tasks as appropriate ."
