According to the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) national clinical guideline for \u201cAssessment, diagnosis and interventions for autism spectrum disorders,\u201d AAC should be considered for all children with ASD in order to improve child-caregiver  communication.(52) AAC can be aided or unaided. Aided AAC requires external equipment, such as picture books/cards, communication boards, or computerized speech-generating  devices. Unaided AAC refers to communication techniques that the person can produce without external resources, such as manual signs/sign language, gestures, and facial expressions.(14,54) Many individuals with ASD use a combination of aided and unaided AAC, and AAC can be used in addition to oral language. The most appropriate model for this assessment is a team assessment with participation and input from family members.(15)An AAC evaluation should include an assessment of the ability to understand symbols. The Tangible Symbol Systems Levels of \u2013What type of AAC does the child use? \u2013Is he or she comfortable with the AAC being used? \u2013How long has the child used AAC? \u2013Does AAC improve communicative efforts both receptively and expressively? \u2013The SLP and communication assessment team (e.g., school teacher, occupational therapist) should always consider the cultural, linguistic, and economic background, as well as the technological proficiency of the family, during assessment and when making recommendations regarding AAC use.(14)Universal design is a relatively new concept with respect to assistive technology, including AAC; the idea of universal design is to create devices that serve needs of a wide range of individuals\u2014those with and without disabilities.(48) For example, there are many apps available for download on the iPad  that allow it to become a high-tech  AAC device for a child with ASD, but can also be used by the patient\u2019s parents whose language abilities are intact.(49) For devices with universal design, no adaptations are necessary.(48) The iPad or other commercially-available  computer tablets also have the advantage of being highly socially acceptable, which is appealing to many parents who do not want their child\u2019s AAC device to appear awkward or stand out(49) An ecological inventory is recommended as part of the AAC assessment. In an ecological inventory, the communication behaviors of the child are observed in a particular setting, such as the classroom. The child\u2019s communicative behaviors are compared with those of peers to illuminate possible discrepancies. In this way, contexts and activities are identified in which the child\u2019s communication skills can be enhanced(15) \u2013For detailed information on use of AAC in assessment and treatment of a child with ASD, see Clinical Review\u2026Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) ; CINAHL Topic IDT709149",

            "Authors of a systematic review of articles published between 1991 and 2001 on communication treatment studies for children with ASD synthesized the results of 60 studies and concluded that several types of treatment approaches are effective, including interventions incorporating sign language, discrete-trial  training, and milieu teaching procedures. In addition, the authors concluded that challenging behaviors decrease when children with ASD are taught efficient and effective communication skills(29)",
            "Authors of a systematic review investigating the effects of communication-based  treatment on children with ASD from 2002 to 2007 synthesized the findings of 36 studies and reported the following overall clinical applications(30) \u2013An individual\u2019s profile of communication abilities and deficits is important in the selection of a particular treatment method \u2013A combination of approaches, rather than a single treatment, might be most beneficial",
            "Treatment approaches \u2013Behavioral interventions -Applied behavior analysis (ABA): ABA is based on the theory of operant conditioning and is designed to eliminate negative behaviors and increase positive ones. Operant conditioning principles include shaping, chaining, discrimination training, and contingency management. Therapy is usually provided in a one-to-one  discrete trial format, and targets can include a variety of communicative functions, including preverbal communication, requesting desired items, social language (e.g., please, thank you), positive interactions with peers, answering wh-questions,  and overall increased  communication.(29) The use of ABA requires specific training. For more information, see research and guidelines by Lovaas(31) -Authors of a systematic review of communication-based  treatments for ASD reported that ABA methods for improving adaptive behavior and communication are well-established.  The authors also concluded that peers can be effective models of target behaviors.(32) The authors caution that individual characteristics should be considered when planning treatment, and that naturalistic or developmental treatment methods might be more appropriate than ABA for some persons with ASD.(32) Some documented limitations of ABA are inadequate generalization, prompt dependence, and lack of motivation(32) -Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention (EIBI): EIBI is based on ABA principles and is typically an intensive home-based  program (upwards of 40 hours per week for two or more years). Reichow presented an overview of five meta-analyses  on EIBI for young children with ASD. He found that the conclusions of four out of the five meta-analyses  indicated that EIBI is an effective intervention for children with ASD.(38) EIBI is a comprehensive treatment with an extensive amount of empirical support. He found that children who receive EIBI have increases on measures of IQ and more moderate increases in adaptive behavior. Gains on standardized language measures are not as frequently reported in studies. Reichow concluded that more studies are needed to determine effects on language ability -Intervention to improve joint attention and symbolic play using ABA and procedures of responsive and facilitative interactive methods: Researchers in the United States examined the effects of an intervention targeting joint attention and symbolic play in children aged three to four years with ASD.(40) Fifty-eight  children were randomized to a joint attention intervention, a symbolic play intervention, or control group. Interventions were provided 30 minutes daily for five to six weeks. After the intervention, children in the joint attention intervention showed more child-initiated joint attention, as well as an improvement in responding to joint attention, and children in the play group showed greater diversity and sophistication of play as compared to the control group -In a five-year  follow-up  study of 40 participants in the study above, researchers found that the joint attention intervention group gained 12.5 expressive language standard score points above the control group and the play group achieved 10.6 standard score points above the control group.(41) The researchers concluded that improved skills of joint attention and play are associated with better later language outcomes \u2013Naturalistic behavioral approaches: Naturalistic behavioral approaches use some of the elements of behavioral training but are conducted in natural environments -Milieu teaching (MT) (enhanced milieu treatment): Features of MT include the following: a) following the child\u2019s attentional lead and establishing joint attention; b) using teaching episodes that are brief, positive, and rewarding, and that are included within natural activities that occur throughout the child\u2019s day (incidental teaching); c) simultaneous teaching of form (syntax), content (vocabulary), and function (pragmatics); d) targeting general communication forms and function that are on the boundary of the child\u2019s productive communicative competence; and e) using mands (requests), questions, and models to elicit production of targets that are related to the child\u2019s focus of attention (i.e., teacher demonstrates a verbal mand for the child to imitate and the child is reinforced by receiving the desired object after producing the imitation); and f) using time delay in which the presentation of a highly desired object out of reach is followed by a delay so that the child has time to initiate a request to receive the desired object(32) -Authors of a review of the literature summarized research findings related to the effects of MT and children with ASD: -Several clinical trials have found MT to be effective for children with ASD(32) -Relatively low-intensity  treatment can lead to significant gains(32) -Treatment leads to gains in joint attention and requesting, particularly for children who exhibited some joint attention capabilities before treatment(32) -In a five-month  study conducted in the United States, researchers investigated the use of MT strategies implemented by teachers in an early-childhood  special education classroom (ECSE).(44) MT strategies were implemented in two activities per day and targeted communication goals for three children with ASD aged two through five years. MT strategies were found to increase spontaneous speech in all three children. The researchers concluded that teacher implementation of milieu MT strategies could provide a cost-effective  way to address communication targets in the classroom -Functional communication training (FCT): The purpose of FCT is to determine the motivation for or purpose of a challenging behavior and then teach a more appropriate replacement behavior. This approach is often used with children  with ASD who exhibit challenging behaviors (e.g., tantrums, aggression, self-injury).  For example, a child who has limited language and who has an excessive number of tantrums may be taught the use of requests (mand training) to obtain desired items. Most of the research on FCT is limited to single-subject  studies, but there is preliminary evidence that FCT is effective in eliminating negative behaviors and generalization of new language skills to other people and environments(32) -Pivotal response training (PRT): PRT uses behavioral approaches in a natural environment. Like MT and FCT, PRT makes use of the child\u2019s interests and allows the child to make choices. All verbal attempts (even approximations) are reinforced and reinforcement is related to the desired behavior (e.g., if the child indicates \u201cmore ice cream,\u201d he/she receives more ice cream rather than praise). Authors of a review of treatments for children with ASD indicated that PRT results in gains in functional communication. Recent research has further explored the types of children who benefit most. Children who have a strong interest in toys and tolerance of others in close proximity before treatment have a higher level of positive response to treatment(32) \u2013Developmental interventions -Developmental interventions include Floortime techniques and the Hanen approach (More Than Words), and are based on the theory that language acquisition is supported by strong adult-child interactions.(32,33) Such approaches are also referred to as responsivity education (RE) because parents are trained to follow their child\u2019s lead, better recognize their child\u2019s nonverbal communication attempts, and respond to them in meaningful ways during play-based  and natural situations. Parent training approaches also help parents to stimulate the child\u2019s communication by structuring conversation and the physical environment. Hanen training has been found to be effective in helping parents increase their children\u2019s ability to be more interactive in communication, resulting in improved interaction by their children. Authors of a review of communication-based  developmental interventions for children with ASD concluded that current findings support the efficacy of parent-based  developmental interventions(32) -In a single-subject  (ABACAD design) study in the United States, researchers compared a social-pragmatic  intervention (\u201cresponsive interaction condition\u201d) and a naturalistic behavioral intervention (MT condition\u201d) on language use and social engagement in five preschool children with ASD(43) -Responsive interaction condition: This intervention consisted of language modeling and expansions that emphasized the child\u2019s language targets. The therapist responded to all communication in a natural way, but did not attempt to elicit any language from the child -MT condition: This condition used direct elicitation of children\u2019s language targets by prompting. The goal was to elicit one language target every 30 to 60 seconds. Four types of milieu prompts were used: 1) modeling, 2) commands, 3) questions, and 4) time delay. When the child used targeted language, the therapist would reinforce with access to desired materials -Analysis of language samples indicated that naturalistic interventions that employed direct elicitation of child language led to larger gains in expressive language targets than interventions that used facilitative strategies (responsive interaction) only \u2013Classroom-based  interventions -Treatment and Education of Autistic and related Communication-  handicapped Children (TEACCH) -TEACCH is a classroom-based  program that emphasizes structure and consistency in a carefully designed environment. Visual supports, such as charts, clearly labeled physical spaces, and picture schedules, are used to supplement auditory information. The aim is to facilitate the independence of children with ASD by providing predictable routines and visual supports -According to the authors of a review of communication-based  studies for children with ASD, present support for TEACCH for improving communication abilities in children with ASD is preliminary and limited, with most evidence of communication gains based on parental report and anecdotal evidence(32) -Project DATA (Developmentally Appropriate Treatment for Autism): Project DATA combines aspects from both the developmental and behavioral models of treatment, integrating family-centered, developmentally appropriate aspects of early-intervention  programs with the direct and explicit components of ABA. Children with ASD attend an early-childhood,  inclusive classroom with more extended time for intensive intervention -Authors of another study of Project DATA conducted in the United States found a differential response to this program among the program participants: some children responding well to the program with significant improvements and others not improving at all; participants that did respond well to the therapy provided through Project DATA were noted to have established joint attention and sociability skills, as well as good use of AAC in social communication  environments, whereas the participants who did not respond to this program had poor underlying joint attention and social/communication skills(34) \u2013Computer-assisted  interventions -Authors of a review of computer-assisted  technologies (CAT) to enhance social and communication development in individuals with ASD found that CAT studies lacked methodological rigor compared to studies that investigated non-CAT approaches.(42) The reviewers reported that potential challenges of CAT approaches are that many programs have not been specifically developed for individuals with ASD and that some employ features (e.g., sounds) that may lead to undesirable behaviors. In addition, they cite the potential social isolation of a child using a program and the lack of generalization of treatment effects as other potential drawbacks. They advocate larger-scale studies that compare CAT approaches to non-CAT approaches \u2013Video modeling -The purpose of video modeling is to teach a child with ASD a particular communication skill through observational learning. The video format is intended to decrease the anxiety that may be associated with direct therapy -Steps in the video modeling approach include:(32) -Videotaped images are made of a target behavior or skill -The child watches the video clips -After viewing the clips, the child practices the skills with a therapist -The child then practices the skill in other settings to provide for generalization -The child observes the videotape again, as necessary -Authors of a review of communication-based interventions for children with ASD reported that there is evidence from multiple studies to support the use of video modeling in increasing social engagement of children with limited verbal skills. There is also support for the use of video modeling to teach play behaviors to children with ASD(32) \u2013Social skills interventions: Social skills interventions include social skills training, the use of social stories, comic strip conversations, and peer/sibling training -Social skills training -In social skills training, children are taught skills such as perspective taking, conversational skills, problem solving, emotional awareness, and regulation -Methods used include coaching, modeling, social scripts, and written cueing -Authors of a systematic review of communication-based  interventions concluded that there is little evidence to support the use of social skills training alone to improve social abilities of children with ASD. Behavioral techniques might be necessary to provide reinforcement for appropriate social skills(32) -Social stories -Social stories are narratives written by parents, teachers, or clinicians to help children with ASD understand certain social situations. It is hypothesized that the child will increase social understanding by repeatedly rereading narratives that are often accompanied by photographs or pictures. In this way, the behaviors in particular social situations become familiar and predictable -Two separate reviews investigating the evidence for social stories concluded that the evidence is limited due to weaknesses in study design(32) -Comic strip conversations -In therapy involving comic strips for social skills training, children with ASD are encouraged to draw comic strips with thought bubbles that describe the intents of verbal communication(35) -Authors of a case study described comic strip conversations in therapy for two boys with ASD in a speech-language pathology classroom setting; pre-made  comic strips were used and gains towards social skills goals were made by both children after four weeks of intervention(35) -For the first child, gains in eye contact and initiation of interactions with typically developing peers were noted; for the second child, social gains were \u201ctremendous,\u201d with significant carryover from the comic strip activity to peer interactions with improved turn-taking  and teamwork(35) -Peer/sibling training -Peer/sibling training involves teaching peers to facilitate social interactions with children with ASD through direct instruction, adult modeling, and prompt reinforcement  -Authors of a review of communication-based interventions for children with ASD reported that peer/sibling training is promising and is based on 20 years of single-subject  studies(32) -In a randomized controlled trial, researchers in the United States compared the relative effectiveness of a peer-mediated  approach (PEER) to a child-assisted  approach (CHILD) on improving social skills of high-functioning children with ASD in general education classrooms.(39) Participants included 60 children with ASD (in first through fifth grade and with IQ > 65) and 815 typically developing children. Participants were in 56 classrooms in 30 different schools across the Los Angeles area. The two interventions were delivered in six weeks with a total of twelve 20-minute  sessions provided two times week. The participants with ASD were randomized to receive the CHILD-assisted  intervention, the PEER-mediated intervention, both interventions, or neither intervention -CHILD: Treatment was delivered in individualized sessions to the child with ASD during recess or lunchtime and focused on improving specific social skills with multiple opportunities for practice (role playing) during sessions with adult coaching, modeling, and feedback. Skills that were targeted were based on the needs of the individual child (e.g., entering a game) -PEER: Group social skills training was based on positive social modeling by peers. Peers met in a group format with a trained interventionist for 20 minutes twice weekly during recess or lunchtime, and practiced facilitating and engaging children with social needs on the playground. For example, they were taught how to identify appropriate and inappropriate behaviors on the playground, as well as to recognize isolated children and to engage them in a game. The student with ASD was never identified to maintain the student\u2019s confidentiality -Measures included the Social Network Survey, a social network salience ratio score, playground observation of peer engagement, and a teacher questionnaire that assessed social skills -The authors concluded that the PEER-mediated intervention produced greater social involvement than the CHILD-mediated  intervention and that improvements in socialization were maintained for up to three months after treatment ended \u2013AAC -Over half of children with ASD remain nonverbal and require an alternate method of communicating, such as the use of aided symbols, speech-generating devices, and/or manual signing. There is a growing body of research supporting the use of AAC in children with ASD(36,37) -For detailed information on use of AAC in assessment and treatment of children with ASD, see Clinical Review\u2026 Augmentative and Alternative Communication: Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) , referenced above .
