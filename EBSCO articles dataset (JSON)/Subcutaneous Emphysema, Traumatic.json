However, patientsreceiving mechanical ventilation may experience complications,including SE. Authors of a systematic review onspeech and safety in tracheostomy patients receiving mechanical ventilation found that the incidence of subcutaneousemphysema is increased when a fenestrated tube is place in a fresh tracheostomy. Optimal positioning is key to avoidthis complication(20)-Authors of a literature review found that SE can occur after transanal procedures(18)-Authors of a systematic review evaluated the efficacy and safety of omitting chest drains after video-assistedthoracoscopic surgery.
