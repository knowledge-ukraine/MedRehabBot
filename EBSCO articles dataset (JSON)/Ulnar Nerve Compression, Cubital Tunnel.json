            "Cubital tunnel syndrome (CuTS) is a common peripheral neuropathy, affecting the ulnar nerve (UN). It is due to compression/entrapment, traction, or ischemia at the post-condylar  (also called medial epicondylaror retro-epicondylar)groove  (behind the medial epicondyle) of the elbow(1,2)",
            "CuTS is characterized by paresthesias and motor deficits in the distribution of the UN. Similar symptoms occur with other diagnoses, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, injury at Guyon\u2019s canal, thoracic outlet syndrome, or C8-T1  radiculopathy, which must be ruled out(1,2)",
            "Conservative treatment of patients with CuTS involves rest/activity modification, splinting to limit elbow flexion, progressive hand and wrist strengthening, modalities (as indicated), functional training (as indicated), and education to minimize provoking factors in daily activities and sports. Cortisone injection may be trialed in severe cases",
            "Patients with persistent or recurrent CuTS, or moderate to severe symptoms, are surgical candidates for release or translocation of the UN(2)",
            "Comparative studies of outcomes after different therapy interventions or after conservative versus surgical management are lacking in the literature"
