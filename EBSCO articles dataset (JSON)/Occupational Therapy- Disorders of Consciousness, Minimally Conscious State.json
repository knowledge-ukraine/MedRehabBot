However, in 2010 Laureys et al. proposed a change in the terminology to unresponsive wakefulness syndromebecause vegetative state was considered pejorative.

        "treatment summary": [
            "Treatment summary: The purpose of occupational therapy for patients who are in an MCS is to provide stimulation with the goals of promoting neuro-recovery  and decreasing functional decay of the extremities as a result of disuse. There is no current universally accepted evidence-based  treatment for UWS \u2013The American Academy of Neurology practice guidelines for patients with disorders of consciousness state that because most studies are open-label  studies and case reports, results need to be interpreted with caution and cannot be translated directly into practice(39)  \u2013According to the national clinical guideline for brain injury rehabilitation in adults from the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN), there is insufficient evidence regarding nonpharmacological interventions for patients in a UWS or an MCS to support a clinical guideline for practice. The evidence reviewed indicated some positive outcomes for multisensory stimulation, music therapy, contingent stimulation, and assistive technology; however, the quality of the evidence was not high enough to establish treatment efficacy(42) \u2013Authors of a systematic review of studies conducted between 2003 and 2013 on the effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions for persons with disordered consciousness found 12 interventions (some of these were nutrition, tracheostomy care, mobility management, and multimodal sensory stimulation) and found insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of multimodal sensory stimulation(35) \u2013The goal of therapeutic coma stimulation or coma arousal programs is to ensure that the patient is receiving holistic care following severe damage to the brain, not just the routine medical care to maintain the functions of the body.(20) Typically, stimulation programs involve intense multimodal stimulation through all five senses.(20,22) Stimulation that has personal meaning to the patient is most effective (e.g., favorite songs, familiar items or routines, pictures) and should be incorporated as much as possible into the treatment.(33) In addition to providing sensory and physical stimulation, OTs might be asked to see patients in an MCS for casting or positioning splints/orthoses and selecting assistive technology devices.OTs also have a role in recognizing unique patient responses (which are sometimes missed on standardized assessments) for ongoing assessment and treatment(34) \u2013Suggestions for occupational therapy for patients in a state of disordered consciousness have been provided by therapists in the intensive therapy unit of the St. George\u2019s Hospital (formerly the Atkinson Morley Hospital) in the United Kingdom:(20) -Begin with passive stimulation (e.g., music, upper extremity massage); move to active stimulation requiring response from the patient (e.g., using therapy bands or therapy putty to elicit a grasping or pulling response) as soon as the patient appears able -Start active rehabilitation as soon as the patient is medically stable per physician order -Provide intense, varied, and consistent stimulation for the patient throughout the duration of the hospital stay -Do not underestimate the intensity of stimulation that may be required to elicit a response from the patient (while monitoring vital signs for undesired effects such as a dangerous increase in ICP, heart or respiratory rate, or blood pressure) -Provide explanations and instructions about providing stimulation for the patient\u2019s family members and friends at bedside \u2013In a study conducted in the United Kingdom, researchers performed retrospective chart reviews documenting dependency levels and physiotherapy interventions in 10 patients who were in a UWS or an MCS over a 3-year  period. Interventions included manual stretching, passive ROM exercises, casting/splinting, botulinum toxin injections, and weight-bearing/standing  exercises (when possible). None of the patients included in the chart review emerged from UWS or MCS. All the patients remained fully dependent for self-care;  however, caregiver burden was reduced following physiotherapy interventions, and all patients reached the point of being able to sustain a seated regimen. In the joints addressed in therapy, there was no minimal clinically significant difference in 85 of 120 joint ranges measured (70.8%). Positive changes were observed in 14 joints (11.7%) and negative outcomes in 21 joints (17.5%)(31) \u2013Sensory stimulation -Authors of an RCT (N = 50) evaluated the effectiveness of a tilt table therapy with or without an integrated stepping device on the level of consciousness in patients with UWS or MCS. Both groups received 10 1-hour  verticalization treatments over the course of 3 weeks(43) -Both groups improved significantly on the CRS-R score during the intervention phase and maintained this gain during the follow-up  period -When comparing the changes in the CRS-R  score in the first three weeks and at six weeks, the group receiving therapy on a tilt table without an integrated stepping device group was statistically superior to the group receiving therapy on a tilt table therapy with an integrated stepping device -The group receiving therapy on a tilt table therapy with an integrated stepping device did not have any additional benefit for patients with disorders of consciousness. However, verticalization may be beneficial to patients with disorders of consciousness and is recommended as a treatment early in rehabilitation -For detailed information about tilt tables, please see  Clinical Review \u2026 Tilt Table  ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T709278  \u2013Splinting/orthosis fabrication -Use of appropriate splinting/orthoses can prevent contractures and/or decrease spasticity(44) \u2013Splints described in research studies with patients with disorders of consciousness include: -prefabricated foam splints -footboards/foot-drop  splints -adaptive shoes -Ankle-foot  splint \u2013Facilitating postural changes -Changing a patient\u2019s position can increase the patient\u2019s level of arousal(23) -Positional changes can also prevent hypovolemia, reduce the risk of skin breakdown in bedbound patients, improve the respiratory system, and change resting muscle length(23) \u2013Assistive technology -The OT can assist in the selection of assistive technology devices for communication and functional independence by determining which behavioral responses (e.g., eye blinks, thumb movements, mouth movements) are the most consistent for the individual patient(9,14,15,29) -Microswitches can be connected to a range of devices (e.g., radio, computer, television) for the patient to control his or her environment and communicate needs and wants(9,14,15,29) -Virtual reality (VR) may be an effective diagnostic and/or neurorehabilitation tool -Authors of a case study and literature review evaluated how the effects of VRon brain activity can be monitored by EEG to both assist in correct diagnosis of level of consciousness and improve the level of consciousness of patients(45) -MCS was diagnosed in a 17-year-old  female following a car accident. She received VR treatments twice a week for 5 months. The treatment sessions followed this protocol: -Ten minutes of relaxing screens -Fifteen minutes of screens with familiar objects (e.g., animals, common objects) -Fifteen minutes of screens of colored geometric figures -Ten minutes of cool-down  relaxing screens -More intentional responses were recorded during the training sessions and alsoobjectively seen in the EEG monitoring -The EEG data was able to confirm the diagnosis of MCS for this patient through the intentional modulation of her brain activity in response to VR training \u2013Reality orientation with post-comatose  patients -Immediately upon emerging from a coma, UWS, or MCS, patients typically are confused, disorientated, amnesic, and aphasic and often cognitively impaired(21,27) -Occupational therapy for these patients initially focuses on reorientation(21) -Ask the family to provide familiar, personal objects such as a poster, stuffed animal, or photographs -Posting a calendar in the room and changing it daily can help reorient the patient to time -Provide emotional support as needed and refer to social work/mental health professional when appropriate .
