            "In the early stages of recovery, the primary goals of therapy are to facilitate wound healing and prevent infection. Other goals of therapy are to control edema, improve PROM, and prevent contracture",
            "In the later phases of rehabilitation, scar management, increasing passive and active ROM and strength, and improving hand function are the primary goals",
            "Significant evidence-based  research is lacking in the rehabilitation of mutilating hand injuries, but clinical experience and expertise help to form a comprehensive and effective rehabilitation program . Problem Goal Intervention Expected Progression Home Program Pain Decrease pain Physical agents/ mechanical modalities _ Various modalities and physical agents can be effective in pain relief, but the choice of which modality/agent to apply depends on the specific nature of the mutilating injury(8)Modalities or physical agents may be effective in relieving pain and tendernessProvide recommendations for home regarding pain relief  Edema Reduce edema Manual therapy _ Retrograde massage may control edema of the wrist, hand, and fingers. AROM exercises also help to produce a natural muscle pumping action to assist with lymphatic drainage and the reduction of edema and can be incorporated into the treatment program if not contraindicated _ _ Physical agents/ mechanical modalities _ The use of intermittent compression pumps, compression gloves, self-adherent wrap, and other anti-edema equipment can help to reduce edema. Patient education to maintain elevation is essentialEdema should be effectively reduced with continued therapyPatient may be provided with methods of safely reducing edema at home (e.g., positioning, retrograde massage)  Healing open wounds/ surgical woundsFacilitate healing as able; prevent scar adhesionsOrthosis fabrication _ The specific type of orthosis required depends on the type and location of injury, as well as if an amputation has resulted in the loss of digits or part of the hand _ _ In general, a resting orthosis may be used, with the joints positioned as follows: slight wrist extension (15\u201320\u00b0), MCP joints in 70\u201380\u00b0flexion, the IP joints near full extension, and the thumb extended and abducted(11) _ _ Protective orthoses will need to be remolded as edema decreases and the amount of wound dressing is reduced _ _ Patients with nerve, tendon, or vascular repairs may require different positioning to protect the repairs and reduce tension on the structures involved _ _ _ Dynamic orthoses may allow for early mobilization (e.g., dynamic traction for flexor tendon rehabilitation) while providing protection for involved joints and soft tissue structures _ _ Orthosis fabrication decisions should be made in consultation with the surgeon so that all members of the rehabilitation team are aware of the restrictions warranted by certain injuries and surgical interventions _ _ Wound care _ Close communication with the surgeon is required for the appropriate choice of dressings and ointments _ _ Whirlpool may be used to facilitate debridement of open wounds but should be used cautiously because of the dependent position required, which increases edema _ _ If permitted by the surgeon, the therapist may be involved in debridement of eschar and other wound careCaring for the wound may help reduce infection and improve healing time _ _ Scar management _ Scar massage should be performed once adequate wound healing is achieved. Increased scar thickness and adherence can reduce skin mobility and the amount of tendon excursion, limiting ROM, strength, and functionProvide oral and written instruction on protection of injury and methods of facilitating healing  Reduced digital/wrist ROMIncrease digital/wrist ROMManual therapy _ PROM should be applied as appropriate, depending on the specific injuries and surgeon restrictions _ _ Early application of stress to repaired soft tissue structures has been shown to affect scar remodeling; studies have demonstrated a faster recovery of tensile strength, decreased adhesion formation, better tendon excursion, and less deformation at the tendon site(12) _ _ Therapeutic exercise _ AROM of the wrist and digits should be initiated as soon as it is safe. At this time, blocking exercises of the PIP and DIP joints may be used to help isolate each joint _ _ Adequate support to the proximal joint is necessary to allow for isolated flexion and extension of the joint. AROM of the MCP joints, AROM wrist extension/flexion, and forearm pronation/ supination should be performed as appropriate _ _ Nerve and tendon gliding (hook fist, full fist, straight fist, tabletop) and intrinsic plus minus positioning may also be incorporated using 3 sets of 15 repetitions _ _ Physical agents/ mechanical modalities _ Moist heat packs, ultrasound, and paraffin may be used, as allowed by physician, to increase tissue elasticity prior to manual therapy and stretching exercisesProgress each unique patient as appropriate and indicatedImplement a home program that incorporates ROM as indicated  Reduced grip/muscle strength _ _ Impaired functionIncrease grip/muscle strength _ _ Improve hand functionTherapeutic exercise _ Once the patient begins to achieve increased AROM, initiate gentle and progressive strengthening when safe to begin _ _ The use of therapy putty, hand grippers, light hand weights/ sticks, rubber bands, resisted clothespins, and other hand therapy equipment may be incorporated to increase grip strength, pinch strength, wrist flexion and extension strength, and pronation/ supination strength _ _ These exercises should be introduced only when deemed appropriate by the surgeon and the therapist, and will vary based on the injury and the surgical interventions performed _ _ These exercises should be performed in a pain-free range and progressed slowly to the patient\u2019s tolerance. Each exercise may be performed in 3 sets of 15 repetitions _ Electrotherapeutic modalities _ NMES may be used in appropriate cases to facilitate the return of muscular contraction and function and prevent atrophy while nerve regeneration occursFunctional training _ Introduce functional strengthening and gradual implementation of typical daily activities as symptoms improve (after pain, edema, ROM, and strength issues have been addressed) _ _ This may include dexterity activities, such as handling and counting change, locking and unlocking doors/padlocks, and removing small objects from therapy putty _ _ Work-simulation activities may also be appropriate in later stages _ _ Gravity-dependent position tolerance training can begin once the wound is healed and edema and vascularization are stable. Patients may begin to do this on their own as they start to use the hand for functional activities _ _If appropriate, a home program can be given to improve results  If appropriate, a home program can be given to improve resultsReduce hypersensitivities as able _ _ Increase patient knowledge on risk of injury/prevention of injury following sensory impairmentSensory reeducation _ May use different textures, such as cotton, silk, or rice, to decrease hypersensitivity _ _ Use of \u201cscrubbing\u201d technique across the affected area to stimulate hypersensitive areas _ _ \u201cParticle baths,\u201d using tubs of progressively challenging textures (rice, Styrofoam pieces, sand), are also helpful _ _ Weight-bearing activities should also be incorporated: cleaning table with rag while putting weight through palm of hand, leaning through hands to make small circles with physioball, carrying weighted objects in affected extremity, and other activities to address the possibility of reflex sympathetic dystrophy _ _ Use of these techniques may be contraindicated with open wounds or in the presence of infectionProgress each unique patient as appropriate and indicatedRecommend strategies for home as indicated ."
