            "Wilson\u2019s disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a mutation in the ATP7B  gene on chromosome 13, a gene responsible for encoding a copper-transporting adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) protein. The mutation leads to an increase in levels of copper in tissue throughout the body.(1,2) Copper, which is present in foods such as chocolate, nuts, and shellfish, is normally transported to the liver, where it is used and the excess is excreted through bile.(3) However, in persons with Wilson\u2019s disease, copper accumulates in the liver and then in other organs (e.g., brain, kidneys), leading to severe damage.(4) Neurologic symptoms typically appear in the second to fourth decades of life and include dysarthria, gait abnormalities, dystonia, risus sardonicus  (grinning expression produced by a sustained spasm of the facial muscles), bradykinesia, rigidity, postural instability, resting tremor, postural tremor, cerebellar disturbances, dysphagia, chorea (abnormal, involuntary movement disorder), and athetosis (slow, sinuous, writhing movements).(1) Common psychiatric symptoms include depression, emotional lability, irritability, and disinhibition. A small percentage of patients exhibit severe psychiatric symptoms, including catatonia, agitation, aggressive behavior, delusional thoughts, and mania.(1) Another common symptom is Kayser-Fleischer rings (brown discoloration around the outside of the iris of the eye)"

            "Dysphagia refers to a difficulty in swallowing due to an inability to move food or liquid efficiently during the oral, pharyngeal, or esophageal phase of swallowing.(5) The oral phase includes sucking, chewing, and moving the food or liquid into the throat. The pharyngeal phase is the initiation of the swallowing reflex, when the food or liquid is squeezed down the throat and the airway is closed off to prevent aspiration (food or liquid entering the airway) or choking. In the esophageal phase, the openings at the top and bottom of the esophagus (feeding tube in throat) move the food or liquid into the stomach by relaxing and tightening.(6) Dysphagia is a common complication of Wilson\u2019s disease. In a retrospective study conducted in Brazil, researchers found that dysphagia was present in 59 out of 119 (50%) patients with Wilson\u2019s disease; of these 59, 14 required enteral feeding.(1) Although authors of several research studies and reviews on the neurological manifestations of Wilson\u2019s disease have found that dysphagia was common in patients, none has outlined the exact symptoms reported by patients or identified through evaluation.(1,2) Only in one study, which was conducted in Brazil with 8 subjects, have authors investigated the specific nature of swallow dysfunction in patients with Wilson\u2019s disease, and it has been criticized for small sample size and other methodological limitations.(7,8) Thus, it cannot be assumed that the following list of symptoms is exhaustive. Reported symptoms of dysphagia in patients with Wilson\u2019s disease from this  small study were prolonged oral transit time and increased oral residue.(7) It can be concluded that more severe symptoms of dysphagia, such as aspiration, occur as a result of Wilson\u2019s disease because 14 patients in the abovementioned study of 119 patients required enteral feeding(1) Causes, Pathogenesis, & Risk Factors"

            "Diet modification: Changing the consistency of food in a patient\u2019s diet might assist in improving the safety and efficiency of the swallow. For example, soft or pureed foods might assist patients who have difficulty with the oral stage of the swallow. Patients who aspirate with thin liquids might benefit from thickened liquids; however, it cannot be assumed that all patients with aspiration benefit from thickened liquids. Clinicians should explore all possible intervention options before recommending thickened liquids, and also determine that aspiration is not occurring with thickened liquids \u2013For detailed information on diet modifications for dysphagia treatment, see Clinical Review\u2026Dysphagia: Swallowing Therapy \u2013 Compensatory ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T709081",
            "Postural therapy: Several postures have been examined to assist in changing the direction of the flow of foods and liquids. Postural techniques include chin tuck, head back, head rotation, side-lying, and headtilt:(9,35) \u2013Chin tuck (chin down): The chin-down  posture serves to narrow the distance between the tongue base and pharyngeal wall and is often effective for patients with tongue base disorders. This posture widens the valleculae so that they can more easily capture the bolus during a delay in the pharyngeal swallow and prevent aspiration before swallowing(35) \u2013Head back (chin elevated): This posture is beneficial for patients who have difficulty moving the tongue or generating adequate lingual pressures to move the bolus from the mouth to the pharynx. For additional protection of the airway, patients can hold their breath before lifting the chin (supraglottic swallow)(35) \u2013Head rotation: This position is useful when there is unilateral laryngeal paralysis or pharyngeal wall paresis. The head should be rotated to the side of the damage so that the pharynx is closed on the weak side and the bolus is directed towards the stronger side(35) \u2013Head tilt: Tilting the head towards the stronger side can also direct the bolus down the stronger side. This might be useful for patients who have neurologic damage on one side of their mouth and pharynx(35) \u2013For detailed information on postural changes for dysphagia treatment, see Clinical Review\u2026Dysphagia: Swallowing Therapy \u2013 Compensatory , referenced above",

Patients might not be able to perform maneuvers if they are unable to follow instructions or remember to use the maneuver during each swallow: \u2013Supraglottic swallow: Breath is held before, during, and after the swallow so that the true vocal folds are closed(35) \u2013Super-supraglottic  swallow: Breath is held while the patient also swallows with extra effort(35) \u2013Effortful swallow: Patient contracts the muscles involved in swallowing with great effort(35)  \u2013Mendelsohn maneuver: The Mendelsohn maneuver is designed to increase the movement of the larynx and hyoid during the pharyngeal swallow. The patient holds the larynx up by using the muscles of the neck or with the hand. This technique should not be considered a permanent solution to dysphagia and should be used only briefly while the swallow reflex returns to its original state(35) \u2013Masako maneuver: The patient holds the tongue, pulling it forward and anchoring it between the front teeth while swallowing. This might be effective for patients who have weak pharyngeal contraction(35) \u2013For detailed information on maneuvers in dysphagia treatment, see Clinical Review\u2026Dysphagia: Swallowing Therapy \u2013Swallow Maneuvers \u2013 an Overview ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T709042and the series of Clinical Reviews on each specific type of maneuver .
