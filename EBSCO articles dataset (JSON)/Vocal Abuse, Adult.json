A rigid laryngoscope provides the clearest view of the larynx; however, the tongue needs to be held by the examiner and normal speech production cannot be performed during the examination. A flexible laryngoscope uses fiberoptic technology, and can be passed through the nose to the back of the throat. This positioning allows for examination of the larynx during voicing.(3,4) Flexible laryngoscopes might be better tolerated by adults who have sensitive gag reflexes Videostroboscopic examination allows the examiner to see the vocal folds vibrating in slow motion and gives information on any abnormalities present during voice production (e.g., abnormal closure). It is performed with instrumentation used for oral endoscopy or nasendoscopy and is combined with a strobe light correlated to vocal fold vibration(3,4)Electroglottography is a system to provide information on vocal fold closure by measuring the electrical resistance of two electrodes placed around the neck(4)",

The authors emphasized the need for larger and better designed studies to investigate the efficacy of prevention training(16)",

Before and after a six-week treatment phase, teachers completed the VHI.(10) Other dependent measures included a voice severity self-rating  scale and an audio recording for acoustic analysis. Only the amplification group showed significant reductions on mean VHI scores, voice severity self-ratings,  and measures of jitter and shimmer(18) \u2013In an RCT conducted in the United States, researchers evaluated the effectiveness of three different treatment programs, voice amplification (n = 25), resonance therapy (n = 19), and respiratory muscle therapy (n = 20) on teachers with voice disorders. Before and after the six-week treatment phase, teachers completed the VHI and a voice severity self-rating scale. Results indicated that only the voice amplification group and the resonance therapy group showed significant reductions in mean VHI scores and in voice severity self-ratings  post treatment(19)",
            "V ocal hygiene education: The purpose of vocal hygiene education is to reduce and eliminate nonspeech and speech-related factors that contribute to inflammation of the vocal fold mucosa.(5) Speech-related factors include reduction of loud voice use and reduction of the amount of talking. Nonspeech factors include laryngopharyngeal reflux, throat-clearing,  hydration, and inhaled irritants (e.g., smoking) \u2013Multiple research studies have found that vocal hygiene therapy in isolation leads to smaller gains in comparison to other types of treatment.(17,18,21) Thus, hygiene education should be coupled with voice production work(22)",

The patient is instructed to create a voice with more forward/frontal tone focus that is associated with more vibratory sensations in the midfacial region (e.g., alveolar ridge).(19) The purpose of this technique is to achieve a stronger voice with minimal effort. RT requires mastery of the basic principles of the technique combined with specific hierarchical training. The patient should progress through a hierarchy of increasingly complex voicing tasks while maintaining the frontal tone focus. RT has been shown to be effective in patients within an RCT conducted in the United States.(19) However, results are preliminary due to the high dropout rate of patients in the RCT and the lack of additional studies to support the use of this technique(19)",
            "Respiratory muscle training (RMT): RMT is designed to strengthen expiratory muscles to assist performers (e.g., singers) to increase ability to produce expiratory pressure. It is hypothesized that the burden on the laryngeal mechanism is reduced when the expiratory pressure is increased, thus leading to reduced chance for tissue injury. Positive effects of this technique have been noted in high-risk  performers and in patients with increased airway resistance due to paralysis or stenosis.
