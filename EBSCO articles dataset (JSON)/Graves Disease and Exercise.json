            "GD is an inflammatory autoimmune disease with an unclear etiology",
            "The hyperthyroidism in GD is caused by long-acting  antibodies to the thyroid-stimulating  hormone receptors (TSHRs) inthe thyroid gland. The antibodies that attack TSHRs are thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins from B-cells.  They mimic thephysiological action of pituitary thyroid-stimulating  hormone (TSH)and thus activate TSHRs without the normal negativefeedback. Consequently, the thyroid gland remains overactive and releases excessive amounts of the thyroid hormones T3(triiodothyronine) and T4 (thyroxine) into the circulation(7)",
            "The complex pathogenesis mechanism of GD likely involves hereditary and environmental factors, including(7)\u2013The HLA gene locus (e.g., HLA-DR3)  in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genomic region\u2013Non-MHC  genes that are implicated include cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated  protein 4 ( CTLA4 ); CD40 molecule,TNF receptor superfamily member 5 ( CD40 ); protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor  type 22 (lymphoid) ( PTPN22 );thyroglobulin ( TG); and TSH receptor ( TSHR )\u2013High iodine intake, certain medications (see Risk factors , below), infection, smoking, and stress are among theenvironmental triggers\u2013Family members with any autoimmune disease (especially Hashimoto\u2019s hypothyroidism) are a hereditary link to GD(2)"

        "pathophysiology": [
            "TSHR antibodies induce uncontrolled thyroid hormone production (thyrotoxicosis)along with hyperplastic growth ofthyroid tissue, leading to goiter and extraocular tissue that bulges the eyeballs (exophthalmos)(1,3)",
            "Excessive secretion of T3 (the primary hormone that controls general metabolism) and T4 increases thermogenesis (i.e.,turnover of adenosine triphosphate [ATP] with heat production). Messenger ribonucleic acid(mRNA) coding for calciumATPase protein increases in muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum, producing myopathic symptoms of hyperthyroidism(3)",
            "The long-acting  TSHR antibodies can contribute to other specific clinical features such as a diffuse vascular goiter,ophthalmopathy, and, less commonly, dermopathy(3)",
            "GD is characterized by elevated serum levels of TSHR antibodies, T4, and T3, and also by very low (possiblyundetectable) serum TSH in a patient with the signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism or thyrotoxicosis.(3,7) The main goalof therapy is to correct the hypermetabolic state caused by the high circulating levels of T3 and T4",
            "Treatment options for hyperthyroidism include prolonged use of antithyroid drugs (methimazole or propylthiouracil, whichis the favored treatment outside of North America), radioactive iodine (RAI) ablation (the most popular approach in NorthAmerica), and thyroidectomy(1,25)\u2013Remission with the use of antithyroid drugs is 40\u201350%  at 12\u201318  months. RAI ablation expedites the return toeuthyroidism but has the adverse effect of permanent hypothyroidism that requires lifetime hormone replacement in morethan 80% of patients. Thyroidectomy can result in iatrogenic hypoparathyroidism or vocal cord paralysis, in rare cases(25)",
            "The hypermetabolic state of GD is associated with both increased aerobic metabolism (oxygen [O2] consumption) andanaerobic metabolism with intracellular lactic acidosis. The elevated metabolism increases demand on the cardiorespiratorysystem to deliver more O2 and remove more metabolites (including lactic acid and ammonia in skeletal muscle) at rest andespecially during exercise(4,5)",
            "Cardiorespiratory responses to submaximal exercise in patients with uncontrolled GD are inefficient because O2 uptake,minute ventilation (i.e., respiratory rate times tidal volume), and HR are increased,(4,5,6) while O2 pulse (O2 uptake dividedby HR, an indicator of stroke volume) is decreased compared to the euthyroid condition(4)",
            "Achieving the euthyroid state after treatment can reduce the following abnormal cardiorespiratory responses associatedwith GD hyperthyroidism(5)\u2013High HR and respiratory frequency at rest\u2013Reduced HR increment (i.e., chronotropic reserve) from rest to the anaerobic (lactate) threshold\u2013Reduced lactate threshold and peak O2 uptake (VO2 peak)(5,8)",
            "Cardiovascular exercise testing in patients with hyperthyroidism usually indicates hyperdynamic function with decreasedefficiency, including reduced cardiac chronotropic, contractile, and vasodilatory reserves.(4) Cardiac impairment maydevelop in part due to transient functional cardiomyopathy/left ventricular failure(9) and imbalance of sympathovagalneural control.(10) Restoration of euthyroidism with medical treatment can ameliorate these potentially harmful cardiacchanges and usually normalizes the HR response to exercise(5,9)",
