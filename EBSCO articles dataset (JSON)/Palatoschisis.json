            "Cleft lip and palate are birth defects in which the lip and/or palate does not form normally in utero, resulting in an opening in the lip and/or palate. Most children with oral clefts are identified prenatally by ultrasound or at birth and might present with cleft lip only, cleft lip and palate, or cleft palate only.(1,2) A submucous cleft of the palate refers to cases in which the cleft is covered by mucous membrane. These clefts are difficult to see when looking in the mouth and are usually diagnosed by touch. Clefts occur in approximately 1 in 700 births with variability related to geographical region, socioeconomic status, and ethnicity.(3) Unilateral cleft lip or palate is more common than bilateral cleft lip or palate(4)"

However, a two-stage  procedure is required if the cleft lip is wide or bilateral.(3) In this case, the first surgery for the lip adhesion typically takes place around 6 weeks of age. The lip adhesion brings the two lip segments together temporarily and is followed by a final lip repair at 3 months of age. Pressure equalization tubes might be inserted at 3 months of age due to the high risk of middle ear pathology in children with cleft palate The authors of a prospective, randomized clinical trial conducted in Denmark found that the timing of the hard palate closure in a twostage  procedure influenced early language development(14) Closure of the residual cleft prior to 12 months of age resulted in the best speech and language outcomes, especially with respect to phonological development(14) In a study conducted in Sweden, researchers found that early closure was associated with better speech outcomes than late closure by comparing consonant production in 28 children born with unilateral complete cleft lip using transcriptions of audio recordings taken at 18 months and 3 years of age. The outcome measures used for comparison were the percent correct consonants adjusted for age (PCCA),  number of established phonemes, and phonological simplification processes at age 3 years;these were compared to consonant inventory at 18 months. The researchers compared the outcomes in speech and phonology in the children with cleft lip and palate according to the methodtwostage closed (TSC; twostage  early hard palate closure, mean age of 12.3 months at surgery, n = 9), two-stage  open (TSO; twostage  late hard palate closure, mean age of 36.2 months at surgery, n = 9), or one-stage  closed (OSC; onestage palatal closure, mean age at surgery 13.6 months, n = 10). Taking into consideration all of the above outcome measures, the best speech/phonology outcomes at age 3 were associated with the OSC group, and the worst outcomes were associated with the TSO group. Overall, there were not significant differences in outcomes at 3 years for the OSC or TSC; however, the outcomes were significantly worse for the TSO group, indicating that early closure (around 12 months of age) should be recommended for the best possible speech outcomes(68) The primary palate repair typically occurs around 12 months(1) and most often before the age of 2 years(15) For patients who have not had cleft palate repair prior to the age of 10 years, late repair will not result in normal speech patterns; however, some improvement in speech sounds can be expected(15) During preschool years, about 20% of children require additional surgery (pharyngeal flap or sphincter pharyngoplasty) to compensate for velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI)(4)T708864 Additional common surgeries include alveolar bone grafting, surgery of the lip and nose to correct deficiencies, or orthognathic surgery for children with skeletal defects affecting the facial profile(4) ",

Hoarseness is common in children with cleft palate.(75) V ocal nodules occur frequently, likely as a result of habitual hard glottal attack in the presence of compensatory articulations or the need for increased effort to achieve greater intensity(74) -Assess prosody in connected speech; abnormal prosodic contours have been described in case studies of individuals with cleft palate(62) \u2013Reading -Literacy problems are common among children with cleft lip and palate.(31,73) If age appropriate, assess reading ability using a standardized test (e.g., the Test of Early Reading Ability) or refer the child to a reading specialist at his or her school. Children aged 4-6 years with cleft lip and palate are at increased risk for reading delays compared to children without cleft lip and palate. The severity of the cleft is associated with the degree of reading delay.(31) Children with cleft lip and palate are at increased risk for verbal memory and phonological awareness deficits, which can lead to impairments of spelling ability(73)",

            "According to the Parameters for Evaluation and Treatment of Patients with Cleft Lip/Palate or Other Craniofacial Anomalies published by the American Cleft Palate-Craniofacial  Association, guidelines for speech-language  pathology services are as follows: \u2013All patients and families should be educated regarding normal speech and language development and seen for an assessment of pre-linguistic speech-language  development by 6 months of age(67) \u2013In cases where development of speech and language is found to be delayed or disordered, an early intervention program should be started focusing on speech sound development, language stimulation, and establishing a home program(67) \u2013Speech-language  evaluations should be conducted twice a year for the first 2 years of life and annually thereafter to ensure that speech and language are developing adequately. After age 6, screening should take place annually until adenoid involution occurs and then every 2 years until dental/skeletal maturity is reached(67) -For children with cleft lip and/or palate who exhibit deficits in speech-language  development or VPI, reevaluations should occur as often as deemed necessary by the patient\u2019s interdisciplinary treatment team(67) -Speech evaluations are essential pre and posttreatment to determine candidacy for and outcomes of medical, surgical, and behavioral interventions and should always include a perceptual assessment of articulation, resonance, and voice(67) -Instrumental evaluations of VP function are necessary for patients with resonance disorders and/or audible nasal air emission; when vocal quality is abnormal, the larynx should be directly visualized before initiation of voice therapy(67) \u2013Biofeedback therapy might be effective for some patients with VP dysfunction; however, blowing exercises and oral-motor  therapy are not(67)",
            "Feeding/nutrition : If the child\u2019s cleft involves only the lip or the lip and alveolus, feeding difficulties are usually minimal. When clefts involve the palate, the opening between the nose and mouth makes it more difficult for the infant to produce negative pressure and achieve effective sucking.(4) The SLP should provide information to the team or the parents to assist the newborn with feeding. Other professionals such as the nurse, occupational therapist, and nutritionist may also provide feeding support. Some specialists have recommended the use of a palatal obturator to cover the palatal opening during feeding. This can be made by a dentist and used soon after birth. However, most children with cleft lip/palate do not require an obturator for successful feeding(4) \u2013The following suggestions for feeding are recommended by the Cleft Palate Foundation:(42) -Place the infant in an upright position so that gravity will help prevent milk from coming through the baby\u2019s nose(42) -Formula/breast milk may come out of the baby\u2019s nose during feedings; however, this does not mean he or she is choking; attempt to alleviate this by keeping the baby more upright(42) -Watch for a pattern of sucking and swallowing \u2013 listen for a swallow followed by a breath; most babies will develop a pattern within a few days after birth(42) -Infants with cleft palate should be given time to feed and should be burped regularly since they tend to swallow a lot of air during feedings. Eventually, feeding time should be no more than 30 minutes for 2-3ounces(42) -Mothers who are unable to nurse but would like to make breast milk available to the infant can use a variety of bottles designed to assist with feeding. If a specialized bottle is not immediately available for infants receiving pumped breast milk or formula, a squeezable bottle can be used with a larger x-shaped  hole cut in an orthodontic or preemie nipple(42) -The following are types of specialized bottles that are manufactured for infants with cleft palate: Mead Johnson\u2019s Cleft Palate Nurser, Medela\u2019s Haberman Feeder, and Children\u2019s Medical Venture\u2019s Pigeon Bottle(42) \u2013Whenever possible, experts recommend using the mother\u2019s preferred feeding method (i.e., breast or bottle)(42) \u2013For detailed information about feeding therapy for patients with cleft palate, see Clinical Review\u2026Feeding Disorders: Infants with Cleft Lip and Palate , referenced above ",
            "Early communicative attempts : Parents should be encouraged to respond to all sounds made by the child because greater parental responsiveness encourages more babbling. Increased babbling might lead to better gains in speech development after palate repair(1) \u2013Studies examining parent and peer preferences suggest that compensatory babbling patterns are preferred over ones that are excessively hypernasal, suggesting that parents may be unintentionally reinforcing compensatory patterns in speech that are difficult to later remediate. Thus, it is recommended to respond to all sound attempts, regardless of the quality of sound used to increase vocalizations. Parents should be instructed on the undesirability of compensatory speech patterns. There are currently no studies regarding the effectiveness of promoting babbling in infants with cleft palate \u2013There have only been a few,very small studies investigating the effects of \u201cnaturalistic\u201d intervention specifically with children with cleft palate.(43,44)This type of intervention promotes the use of naturalistic intervention models to promote functional speech and language development(1,72) \u2013There is no evidence that palatal obturators enhance consonant development during babbling for babies with unrepaired cleft palate(45)",
            "Hypernasality/VPI : VPI might result from lack of contact between the soft palate and pharyngeal wall due to length, weakness, stiffness (e.g., due to scar tissue), or postsurgical tethering of the velum.(24) Another reason for VPI is a palatal opening (fistulae). When VPI is present, it tends to worsen with fatigue. Speech therapy is reportedly successful in correcting VPI in a majority of patients with mild hypernasality, but some children need additional palatal surgery or a prosthesis to correct more moderate or severe symptoms.(4,24) Studies examining the efficacy of behavioral treatment for VPI are limited. There is no support for the use of nonspeech tasks such as blowing, sucking, or swallowing to increase VP function \u2013Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) -Positive airway pressure is delivered to the nasal passage via a mask to provide progressive resistance against which the VP musculature must function when a hypernasal person is speaking. By functioning against progressive resistance, it is hypothesized that the VP musculature will strengthen -Forty-three  subjects participated in a single group study conducted in the United States that examined the effectiveness of an 8-week  (6 days a week, 10-24  minutes), home-based  CPAP regimen. Results indicated variability among participant response, with some achieving decreased hypernasality. Further research is needed to confirm the efficacy of CPAP for VPI and hypernasality(46) \u2013Visual feedback -Several studies (conducted in Germany and Mexico) have used nasopharyngoscopy to provide biofeedback to the patient about VP function during speech.(47,48,49) These studies have had promising results, but the nasopharyngoscopic endoscope required for feedback is invasive (inserted in through the nares) and are often not available in the clinical setting -Less invasive feedback measures such as a See-Scape  can be used to provide visual feedback for self-monitoring  of oral/nasal airflow while the patient produces words that include nonnasal sounds. VP strengthening methods have been described, such as using a See-Scape  with blowing exercises, but research documenting the effectiveness of such procedures is lacking(24) \u2013Speech-aid  prosthesis -Speech bulbs and palatal lifts are two types of prostheses that have been used to permanently close the VP port and/or to stimulate VP movement prior to secondary surgical management.(50,51) Evidence from small research studies and case studies suggests that a prosthesis might assist with increased levator activity and improve speech intelligibility in some patients.(50,51,53) However, firm evidence regarding the effect of prostheses on VP function is lacking. Some children who are not candidates for surgery or who have had less than optimal results with surgery may also benefit from a prosthetic device.(24)When appropriate, SLPs should refer a child to a prosthodontist for an evaluation",
            "Compensatory articulations : The most common compensatory articulations in children with cleft palate are glottal stops, pharyngeal stops, and pharyngeal fricatives.(81) There is limited research on the effects of intervention targeting articulation in children with cleft palate(1) \u2013Focused stimulation (FS) approach -The FS approach is a naturalistic intervention based on \u201chigh-density\u201d modeling and responsive interaction with little direct prompting.(1) Components of this approach include following the child\u2019s lead, facilitating conversation through games/books, modeling, and expansion and responsive interaction. This approach was developed for use with children  with language delays and has most recently been applied in a study with children with repaired cleft palates. In a study conducted in the United States examining the use of parent-delivered  FS with children with compensatory articulations, researchers found that 60% of the children exhibited a reduction in glottal stop use(52) \u2013Whole language vs. phonological treatment -In a study conducted in the United States utilizing random assignment (N = 30), researchers compared a phonologic approach (remediation of speech errors at the rule level) to the whole language approach (naturalistic language approach using play and story books with speech sounds targeted indirectly) in remediating compensatory articulation disorder (CAD) for children with repaired cleft palate ranging in age from 3 to 7 years. Intervention was delivered in small groups (2-3 children) for 1-hour sessions 2 times a week. Results indicated that the whole language approach required more time to reduce compensatory articulation errors than the phonological approach. However, the authors emphasized that children with CAD often have accompanying language delays and that it is reasonable to address CAD and linguistic targets simultaneously given limitations in time and resources(52) \u2013Treatment for glottal stops -It is common for children with cleft palate to articulate nonnasal consonants incorrectly in the larynx by forcefully approximating the vocal folds instead of stopping the airflow in the mouth. It is recommended to treat these errors as soon as the child will tolerate behavioral treatment. The following are guidelines to assist with the elimination of glottal stops.(32) Have the child: -Exhale or sigh on the hand or mirror -Make a sustained /h/ sound -Make a sustained /h/ sound followed by a sustained vowel -Say /ahaaaaa/ -Say /hhaaapppaa/ (making a light /p/ contact) -Add other sounds and use nasal sounds (/aaammmaaa/) -Repeat with the nostrils pinched closed \u2013Corrective babbling -Corrective babbling is a phonetic-based  speech intervention developed for children with articulation errors related to a repaired cleft palate. Corrective babbling is implemented by a child\u2019s parent(s) or primary caregiver(s). Parents are trained in the method of corrective babbling, which involves behavioral treatments and techniques for sound stimulation, and provided with a manual. Parent(s)/caregiver(s) are asked to work with their child for 10 minutes per day and meet with the SLP regularly for follow up sessions(54) -In a study conducted in Canada with 13 children with articulation errors due to repaired cleft palate, researchers found that children who followed the program as prescribed over the course of four months made articulation improvements. In this study, participants were placed in either an immediate or delayed treatment group in order to have a control group comparison. Most of the participants did not execute the program as prescribed (i.e., 10 minutes daily), but for those that did, significant improvements in articulation were observed. Researchers could not draw firm conclusions regarding effectiveness of corrective babbling for children with cleft palate and recommended further research with larger sample sizes and longer study durations(54) \u2013Electropalatography (EPG) -EPG includes an artificial hard palate constructed to fit against the speaker\u2019s hard palate which is connected to a computer to provide the speaker with feedback regarding articulatory placement. The authors of single case and small group studies have reported positive outcomes with EPG to assist with palatalized and nasopharyngeal misarticulations.(55,56) Following a study conducted in Scotland examining SLPs\u2019 views of outcomes using this method, researchers indicated that EPG is particularly useful in the \u201cestablishment phase\u201d but that other methods should be used in addition to EPG to facilitate generalization of newly learned sounds.(56) Authors of a review of 6 studies of speech therapy for patients with cleft palate found considerable variability in methodology and outcomes; overall, this preliminary research did indicate that EPG was a promising tool for increasing the speech intelligibility of children with cleft palate. The authors of 3 of the studies found EPG resulted in faster improvements in the articulation of sounds that were resistant to conventional articulation therapy(57) \u2013Holistic paradigm to reduce social anxiety -In a single group study conducted in the United Kingdom, researchers investigated an approach for children (8-14  years, N = 12) that focused on cognitive, emotional, and psychosocial dimensions of communication within a \u201csupportive\u201d 6-day  course. Results indicated positive effects on the children\u2019s \u201ccommunication and psychosocial functioning\u201d(58)  .
