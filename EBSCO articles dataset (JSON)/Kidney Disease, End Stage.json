            "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common medical condition, affecting 11\u201313%  of U.S. adults aged 20 years and older, that is mainly due to uncontrolled hypertension and diabetes(9,10,27)",
            "CKD is defined as a reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) to below 60 ml/ min/1.73m2 (normal values range from 90 to 120 ml/min/1.73m2) for 3 months or more(27)",
            "CKD can be broken down into the following stages:(27) \u2013Stage 1 \u2013 Kidney damage with normal or elevated GFR (\u2265 90) \u2013Stage 2 \u2013 Kidney damage with mildly reduced GFR (60\u201389) \u2013Stage 3a \u2013 Mildly-moderately  reduced GFR (45\u201359) \u2013Stage 3b \u2013 Moderately-severely  reduced GFR (30\u201344) \u2013Stage 4 \u2013 Severely reduced GFR (15\u201329) \u2013Stage 5 \u2013 End-stage  renal disease \u2013 GFR < 15 (or on dialysis)",
            "In most cases, the characteristic signs and symptoms of CKD do not appear until excessive metabolic toxins accumulate in blood (uremia), and thus the diagnosis is usually made at an advanced stage of renal impairment(27)",
            "Physical functioning often is compromised after signs/symptoms of uremia appear, and worsens with disease progression(1)",
            "Individualized aerobic and resistance exercise training is indicated to counteract cardiovascular deconditioning, muscle weakness, and increased coronary risk, as well as to improve functional capacity, uremia-specific  measures, and QOL(1)",
            "Authors of a 2015 review recommended that prescription of exercise interventions should become part of the standard nephrological care for patients with CKD(28) \u2013Based on the fact that physical activity (PA), cardiorespiratory fitness, and muscle function are low in patients with CKD and that a sedentary lifestyle has been associated with an increased risk of mortality and morbidity \u2013An expert statement issued by researchers in the United Kingdom (British Association of Sport and Exercise Sciences \u2013 BASES) also states that renal medicine services need to evolve to incorporate exercise rehabilitation as part of a comprehensive and integrated renal care package, including \u201cexercise on prescription\u201d(29)",
            "This Clinical Review discusses interventions in CKD patients in stages 1\u20134 who are not dependent on hemodialysis or kidney transplantation; i.e., interventions required to sustain life in ESRD  \u2013Exercise prescription during dialysis treatments or after kidney transplantation is the focus of a separate review.

            "Exercise/PA/lifestyle modifications \u2013Researchers investigating the perspective of the patient with CKD on exercise and PA identified both barriers to exercise and motivating factors(31) -Barriers: physical (fatigue, non-specific, comorbidities), psychological (reduced motivation, anxiety) and social (time and cost) -Motivators: support, education, and gentle exercise -Preferred exercise was walking, and authors suggested that walking combined with an educational manual has the potential to encourage patients with CKD to be more active -Based on questionnaires (Leisure Time Questionnaire and free text comments on preferred exercise) given to 1,357 pre-dialysis  patients at 3 clinics in the United Kingdom -1,104 or 81.4% of the pre-dialysis  patients were labeled inactive \u2013Exercise has been shown to improve efficiency of muscle mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, which is strongly correlated with muscle power(12) \u2013Researchers in Pakistan investigated the effectiveness of high-intensity  aerobic resistance exercise, including interval and circuit training, on improving exercise capacity in patients with CDK(7) -82 patients ages 36\u201371  years with CKD stages 2\u20135 were recruited to participate in the study and assigned to either the interval group (N = 41) or the circuit group (N = 41) -Each group exercised 3x/week for a duration of 50\u201355 minutes for 8 weeks (2 weeks supervised followed by 6 weeks at home). Borg\u2019s RPE scale was used to monitor and modulate exercise intensity, frequency, and duration during each session. Vital signs (pulse rate and BP) and 6MWT were assessed at baseline and post intervention -Exercise protocol for the interval group consisted of 10-minute  warm-up  of general stretching, followed by 30\u201335 minutes of aerobic and resistive training (usinga stationary bike only) followed by 10-minute cooldown. The circuit training group performed the same 10-minute  stretch warm-up,  followed by 30\u201335 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise (cycling, stair-stepping,  walking,and light weights) without rest periods, followed by 10 minutes of cooldown -Both groups demonstrated significant improvements in pulse rate and performance on the 6MWT. Authors concluded that this model of combined supervised and home-based  exercise training was an effective way to improve exercise capacity in patients with CKD \u2013Improved biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress with training suggest that both endurance and strength training exercises improve muscle function and strength(13) -59 patients (40 men and 19 women) undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) and 22 (17 men and 5 women) normal controls (CTL),with a mean age of 42 for the MHD and 41 for the CTL,were enrolled in the study -Subjects were randomly assigned to one of 5 groups: 1) CTL (N = 22), 2) MHD with no training (NT; N = 15), 3) MHD with endurance training (ET; N = 13), 4) MHD with strength training (ST; N = 17) and 5) MHD with combination of strength and endurance training (EST; N = 14) -Participants performed supervised exercise 3 x/weekfor 21 weeks, with an initial duration of 20 minutesper session progressed to 40 minutes by week 8 with advancement in work intensity as tolerated -Skeletal muscle biopsies of the right vastus lateralis (VL) muscle wereobtained at baseline and post intervention  -Post intervention, compared to baseline the capillary density of the VL muscle increased significantly in both the EST and ET groups but not in the ST group. Researchers concluded that performance of ET and EST improves oxidative capacity and muscle power of MHD patients \u2013A routine walking program can enhance immune function and reduce inflammation(14) -Based on a small non-randomized  study involving 15 dialysis-dependent  patients with CKD -Patients performed home-based  treadmill walking at 1% grade for 30 minutes at a speed that elicited a RPE 12\u201314,  5 days/week for 6 months -All patients completed an exercise test (recording of HR response to exercise) and blood samples of inflammatory markers were obtained at rest (pre-exercise),  immediately after exercise,and 1 hour after exercise at baseline and 6 months \u2013Researchers conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of exercise training on markers of inflammation and nutrition in non-dialysis-dependent  (NDD) patients with CKD(15) -16 RCTs (N = 724 patients) through October 2020 were included -The overall effect of exercise on BMI, waist circumference, and levels of inflammation was statistically significant -Researchers concluded that exercise training may improve inflammatory status in NDD-CKD  patients and enhance weight loss in obese adult CKD patients \u2013Exercise may improve depression and anxiety in patients with CKD(34) -Based on the results of a systematic review and meta-analysis  including 8 RCTspublished through February 2020 -Results showed that participants in exercise programs experienced decreased self-reported  levels of depression and anxiety \u2013Occupational therapy provided for hospitalized CKD patients improves functional capacity and promotes independence through the provision of education and emotional support(35) \u2013Compared to aerobic exercise only, exercise programs combining aerobic and resistive training performed for more than 6 months result in greater improvements in exercise capacity (VO2) (25) \u2013The BASES expert statement suggested using the FITT (frequency, intensity, time, type) principle when prescribing exercise for patients with CKD(29) \u2013Primary care physicians need to be educated on the benefits of exercise training and guidelines for training for patients with CKD(32) .
