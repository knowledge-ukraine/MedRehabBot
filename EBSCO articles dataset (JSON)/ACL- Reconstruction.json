            "The ACL consists of two major fiber bundles with attachments on the lateral femoral condyle and medial tibial eminences(1,2) \u2013Anteromedial bundle: primarily restrains anterior tibial translation in flexion \u2013Posterolateral bundle: primarily stabilizes knee in near-full extension, preventing hyperextension",
            "ACL reconstruction with harvested tendons is the surgical treatment option for a patient with an ACL-deficient  knee after rupture/disruption \u2013Indications for ACL deficiencyand need for reconstruction -Mechanism of injury consistent with ACL tear (3) -Knee gave way with change of direction (turning) and weight-bearing  on affected limb -Knee gave way on twisted landing from jump -For adolescents, please see Clinical Review\u2026Anterior Cruciate Ligament Tear: Pediatric ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T708936.For prevention, please see Clinical Review\u2026Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury: Prevention ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T708848 -Patient reports symptoms of knee rotational instability/laxity when pivoting or stopping -Biomechanical testing of human cadaveric legs investigated the tibia femoral kinematics and stress on the ACL with a simulated landing. Anterior tibial translation and knee abduction occurred simultaneously; internal tibial rotation began and peaked significantly later in the landing. Internal tibial rotation reached 63% of its maximum value when the peak ACL strain occurred(56) -A high knee abduction moment (KAM) associated with low hamstring to quadriceps strength ratio was the most accurate predictor of future ACL injury in adolescent female athletes during a drop-vertical  jump task(57) -ACL rupture during cadaveric simulated landing was found to correlate with KAM, anterior tibial shear force, and lateral tibial force at impact(71) -Impaired knee function after ACL injury reduces physical activity and health-related quality of life (HRQoL)(41) -ACL injury commonly occurs in sports. Many athletes wish to regain their ability for high-speed  cutting, turning, agility running, and/or jumping (e.g., soccer, football, basketball, tennis, skiing) and return to sport(4)  -Clinical tests indicating the ACL-deficient  knee (see Relevant tests and measures , below)(3,4,5) \u2013Predictors of increased risk for ACL deficiency -Authors of a 2015 systematic review of factors predictive of progression to surgery after nonoperative treatment of an ACL rupture indicate that neither sex nor severity of knee joint laxity soon after injury can predict whether a patient will need reconstruction(64) -All other factors (e.g., hop tests, medial collateral ligament injury, quadriceps strength ratio, activity level) had conflicting or only minimal evidence of their association with need for reconstruction -Seven studies were included. Only three were of high quality \u2013In one high-quality  study, knee shape was found to be predictive. Spherical shape of the femoral condyle was predictive of need for reconstruction.(65) Future research is needed to independently validate this findingTypes of ACL reconstruction -Conventional transtibial single-bundle  (CSB) reconstruction involves single femoral and tibial tunnels, whereas in the anatomic double-bundle  (ADB) technique separate tunnels are drilled for the anteromedial bundle and the posterolateral bundle(1,2,6) -Tunnels are drilled in the femur and tibia to fix the graft -Two surgical techniques of drilling the femoral tunnel for placement of the graft are the transtibial technique and the anteromedial portal technique. In the United States, data from 387 patients at 6 years post ACL reconstruction were collected to analyze repeat ipsilateral knee surgery. The group of patients who had the transtibial drilling procedure had significantly higher odds of undergoing a repeat surgery when compared to the group with the anteromedial single bundle (ASB) portal drilling technique, which has been documented to improve anatomical placement(59) -Authors of an RCT in Slovenia found that ADB reconstruction was superior to both CSB and ASB reconstruction techniques(60) -281 patients prospectively randomized into the three groups: ADB, CSB, and ASB. Follow-up  was 3\u20135years, outcome measures were the Lysholm Knee Rating Scale, the subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) form, the KT-1000 arthrometer, and the pivot-shift  testAllograft (allogenic) or autograft (autologous) harvested tendon -Bone-patellar  tendon-bone  (BPTB) graft: middle third of patella tendon with attached bone blocks that allow bone-to-bone  fixation -Four-strand  hamstrings tendon (HT) graft: double-loop  of semitendinosus and gracilis (STG) tendons attached by soft tissue fixation -Similar, consistently good long-term  (> 24 months) knee joint functional outcomes are associated with either the BPTB or HT graft(7,8,9) -Based on two systematic reviews, the BPTB autograft may provide better knee joint stability than the HT autograft, but is associated with more postoperative anterior knee complications(8,9) -Comparison of two techniques of ACL reconstructive surgery with allograft: the CSB (control) vs. the all-inside  tibial socket technique(51) -Researchers conducted an RCT in the United States involving 150 patients with ACL deficiency who chose to have ACL reconstructive surgery using one of these two methods -There was no difference between the two methods in the outcome measures, including the IKDC knee history and examination form, the Knee Society Score (KSS) for pain and function, and the Short Form 12 (SF-12) -The V AS pain score compared to baseline was significantly lower for the all-inside  technique on day 1, on day 7, at 1.5 weeks, and at 24 months -Authors of a 2020 systematic review of the risk for new meniscal tears after ACL injury foundthat the evidence to guide the choice of surgical treatment for ACL reconstructionwas too weak(72) -Authors of a 2019 systematic review found that high tibial osteotomy (HTO) for ACL revision produced good postoperative functional outcomes, low complication rates, and no reported re-ruptures.  The main indication for performing HTO during ACL surgical revision was a posterior tibial slope of more than 12\u00b0, or severe varus malalignment(73) -In pediatric and adolescent populations nonoperative treatment of ACL injuries used to be the treatment of choice; however, this view is now considered obsolete except in rare circumstances(66) -Concern about interruption of the physis and potential growth disturbances was the main reason for the controversy  -Evidence is lacking that the relatively small interruptions of the tibial and femoral physes that occur during transphyseal ACL reconstruction in skeletally immature individuals will cause significant growth arrest or angulatory deformities -Technique for the type of ACL reconstruction used will depend on status of the physis. Graft source may depend on technique used",
