            "CP results from a static lesion of the immature brain, typically defined as the brain of a child 2 years of age or younger.(1) The brain injury can occur prenatally, perinatally, or postnatally. CP\u2019s primary symptom is motor impairment. Motor impairment might vary from mildly impaired gait to wheelchair dependence. There are multiple ways in which the various types of CP can be grouped.(59) Three classifications of CP based on motor function have been identified: pyramidal (spastic), extrapyramidal (ataxic or athetoid), and mixed.(59) A patient\u2019s presenting neurological signs, muscle tone, and body movements determine which type of CP is diagnosed.(3) The spastic type of CP can be divided according to the parts of the body affected: monoplegia, diplegia, triplegia, quadriplegia, and hemiplegia.(1) Communication impairments, especially dysarthria, can occur with each type of CP(2)",
            "Symptoms of CP are extremely variable but can include: \u2013Abnormal movements(1) \u2013Abnormal muscle tone(1) \u2013Cognitive impairment(1) \u2013Depression(1) \u2013Difficulty managing saliva \u2013Feeding difficulties/dysphagia(1) -Patients with CP are at risk for severe malocclusion which can significantly impair feeding ability(4) -For detailed information on assessment and treatment of dysphagia in patients with CP, see Clinical Review\u2026 Dysphagia: Cerebral Palsy (Children) ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T708945 \u2013Functional deterioration of the upper extremity(1) \u2013Impaired cardiopulmonary functioning(1) \u2013Impaired communication(1) \u2013Loss of range of motion (ROM)(1) \u2013Malnutrition or obesity(1) \u2013Pain(1) \u2013Seizure disorder(1) \u2013Sensorineural hearing loss \u2013Spasticity(1) \u2013Urinary difficulties(1) \u2013Visual impairment or blindness \u2013Weakness(1)",

Twenty-one  percent of the children had a speech disorder (dysarthria or apraxia) and an additional 32% of the children in this cohort were classified as nonverbal. Severity of speech disorders was correlated to the severity and type of CP. The two types of CP associated with the greatest speech deficits were bilateral spastic and dyskinetic CP(56) \u2013Patients with CP often have difficulty producing gestures, exhibiting facial expressions, and engaging in social communication(5) \u2013Dysarthria, dyspraxia, and/or ataxia is often observed in patients with CP(1,2,3,5)  -Dysarthria can be present in any type of CP; for detailed information on the various types of dysarthria see the series of Clinical Reviews on dysarthria -Because CP affects the developing brain, the features of dysarthria accompanying CP will differ from those of dysarthria in older adults and might not be as easily identifiable as spastic, ataxic, flaccid, hyperkinetic, or hypokinetic dysarthria(6)",

            "speech and language examination": " Speech and language examination (including reading)  \u2013SpeechPatients with CP might exhibit articulation that is imprecise and variable.(3) These patterns might negatively affect speech intelligibility. Articulation skills can be assessed using standardized assessments or by obtaining and analyzing a speech sample -In a study conducted in the United States of speakers with CP (mean age = 30.43 years; SD = 16.04), researchers found significantly increased frequency of errors as the articulatory complexity of consonants increased; fricatives and affricates were most frequently misarticulated(30) -Patients with CP have a slowed rate of speech(3,53) -Assess for dysarthria -Any type of dysarthria can occur as a result of motor impairments in CP. In some cases it might be difficult to classify exactly with which type of dysarthria the patient presents because the speech is so distorted. In a study with 19 adult patients with CP conducted in Germany, researchers found that most of the subjects included in this study exhibited spastic dysarthria (14/19). An additional 3 subjects had hyperkinetic dysarthria, 1 subject had ataxic dysarthria, and 1 subject had mixed spastic-hyperkinetic-ataxic dysarthria(55) -In a study conducted in the United States with 19 children with CP aged 30\u201336months,  researchers found that 60% of the children in the study who could talk at this age had speech or language deficits, including dysarthria. The results of speech analysis in this study indicated that vowel space, maximum utterance length, articulation rate, and language comprehension abilities collectively contribute to speech intelligibility in young children with CP. V owel space (a graphical means of showing where a vowel speech sound is located in both \"acoustic\" and \"articulatory\" space) was the only one of these variables that made a significant independent contribution to speech intelligibility with these subjects(51) -In a study conducted in Canada with 12 children with CP with dysarthria, researchers found that calculation of percent consonants correct (PCC) was the single best predictor of speech intelligibility scores in these children. PCC is calculated by transcribing a speech sample of at least 100 words, adding up the total number of consonants produced and the total number of correct consonants, and dividing the number of correct consonants by the total number of consonants and multiplying the answer by 100 to determine the PCC.(50) Children also made numerous errors on vowels, but researchers found that percent vowels correct (PVC) was not as good a predictor of speech intelligibility as PCC in this group of subjects(50) -Standardized tests of dysarthria(31) Purpose is to quantify single word intelligibility, sentence intelligibility, and speaking rate for adult and adolescent speakers(32) Purpose is to diagnose dysarthria and to provide differentialreflexes, respiration, lips, palate, laryngeal, tongue, intelligibility, and influencing factors (e.g., hearing, mood, language). Norms are provided for patients aged 12\u201397(33) Purpose is to evaluate children and adults with dysarthria. Includes 21 quantitative tasks and 15 rating scale tasks which are used to determine the severity of a patient\u2019s dysarthria and make recommendations for treatmentPatients with CP often have poor respiratory support and respiratory patterns that negatively affect speech production.(1,3) Respiration should be evaluated while the patient is at rest, during phonation, and during speech production tasks.(34) The patient\u2019s respiratory support should be evaluated in addition to his or her ability to coordinate respiration and phonation. Kinematic measures, such as magnetometer systems or respiratory inductive plethysmography, can provide objective information on a patient\u2019s patterns of inhalations and exhalations(35)Due to the high likelihood of impairments to the respiratory and laryngeal system in CP, breath patterns should also be evaluated.(3) Breath pattern observations should note irregular breathing rates, the absence of normal inhalation-exhalation  patterns, the initiation of speaking at atypical points in the respiratory cycle, the interruption of speech from sudden, forced inspiratory/expiratory sighs, exaggerated respiratory maneuvers, running out of air before inhaling, and breathing at syntactically inappropriate locations in the utterance(35)Assess the patient\u2019s receptive and expressive language skills using standardized language tests or language sampling, as appropriate. As with cognitive testing, the impact of motor and speech impairments on a patient\u2019s ability to respond to test questions should be taken into consideration. Although the prevalence of language disorders among  persons with CP is unknown, they might experience difficulty in receptive and/or expressive language skills.(2) More specifically, they often experience difficulty acquiring pre-literacy  and literacy skills and may be at increased risk for grammar-related language delays(10,11)a computer-based  assessment developed in 2010 that is designed to assess comprehension of spoken language with the CP population(36) -Researchers in the Netherlands investigated the reliability and validity of the C-BiLLT  in 806 typically developing children and 87 nonverbal children with CP. Researchers found evidence of good reliability and validity as a measure of spoken Dutch language comprehension. Testing activities were found to be accessible to children with CP, who often cannot participate in standardized assessments. Researchers stated that when normative data are more firmly established, the C-BiLLT  might be a reliable measure of Dutch receptive language in children with severe CP or other complex communication needs(66) -Researchers who conducted a study in the United States with 34 children with CP aged 4 years found that the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI) was an appropriate measure to identify language delay in these children; however, it did not fully capture impairment of social function(49)For younger children, assess interaction patterns of a child with CP and parent(s)/caregiver(s). Document positioning that is/is not facilitative to communication, the existence or absence of communication opportunities, and the ability of the parent/caregiver to respond to the child\u2019s communicative signals. Research has shown that children with CP and their parents/caregivers have restricted interaction patterns in which the child initiates less, has a more responsive role, and is less independent than a typically developing child.(5) For a school-aged  child, a classroom observation is appropriate for documenting social language skillsChildren with CP often display impaired nonverbal communication, such as impaired use of eye gaze, impaired use of gesture, impaired use of pointing, impaired use of vocalizations, and impaired control of facial expression.(5,7) These impairments negatively affect the early interaction patterns between children with CP and their parents/caregivers.(7) Nonverbal communication skills should be evaluated through parent/caregiver interview or observation of parent/caregiver-child interactions in a natural context. When spoken language is significantly impaired, the potential functional use of nonverbal (unconventional) communication should be explored(13) -In order for eye gaze to be utilized functionally for communication, the patient must be able to use \u201ceye-pointing,\u201d which combines visual, social, cognitive, and motor skills. In a study conducted in the United Kingdom, researchers summarized the components of an eye-pointing  evaluation for individuals with CP.(62) The clinician should observe and -Ability to maintain fixation on a target; can the patient maintain fixation on both moving and stationary objects?(62) -Ability to shift fixation; can the patient accurately and purposefully shift attention between objects and the background?(62) -Understanding of cause and effect with respect to communication(62) -Ability to communicate preference; does the patient exhibit interest in given objects and persons? Does the patient have clear likes and dislikes for objects and activities?(62) -Social communication skills; how does the patient respond to social engagement from potential communication partners? Is the patient able to maintain eye contact? Does the patient exhibit joint attention skills?(62) -Visual recognition ability; does the patient appear to recognize preferred objects?(62) -Symbolic comprehension; does the patient understand that an object or picture can represent something else?(62) -Verbal language comprehension(62) -Corroboration; can the patient confirm or deny a communication partner\u2019s interpretation of eye-pointing  behavior (e.g., head nod, \u201cyes,\u201d or shake, \u201cno\u201d)?(62)Patients with CP often present with a harsh or breathy voice. They might have continuous voicing.(3) An -V ocal tremor -Excessive or limited pitch variation -Excessive or limited loudness variation -Abnormal nasality  -Wet phonation -Hoarseness and/or breathiness -For detailed information on evaluation of the voice and voice disorders, see the series of Clinical Reviews on this topicPatients with CP are at increased risk for reading difficulties.(11,37)According to American Speech-Language-Hearing  Association (ASHA) clinical practice guidelines, it is appropriate for an SLP to evaluate for and treat reading and writing impairment.(60) The rationale for SLPs to be involved in the development of literacy for(a) spoken language lays the foundation for reading and writing; (b) spoken and written language are interdependent in that each builds on the other to create language and literacy competence throughout the lifespan; (c) children with spoken language deficits often experience difficulty learning to read and write; and (d) intervention for spoken language often results in improvements in written language abilities and vice versa.(60) Administer age-appropriate standardized phonological awareness tests and reading tests.(38) The components of the reading evaluation will depend on the age of the child and developmental level. These components might include letter identification, letter-sound  identification, phonological awareness skills, site word reading, fluency, and reading comprehension(60)",

            "Overview of research support for intervention \u2013Authors of a Cochrane systematic review reported that published research on speech-language  interventions for individuals with CP typically focuses on one of two areas: therapy provided directly to a child with CP (\u201cdirect therapy\u201d) or therapy focusing on training parents/caregivers to become better conversation partners (\u201cindirect therapy\u201d).(2) Direct therapy was most often sought to facilitate the emergence of pre-intentional communication (mutual gaze, interpreting habitual behaviors as being communicative even when not intentional by the child), improve pragmatic language skills, and improve expressive language skills -Results from the studies included in the Cochrane review on direct intervention consistently show increases in pre-intentional  communication, increases in requests for objects or actions, increases in responsiveness to others\u2019 communication, and improvements in the use of expressive language structures. Due to the fact that the studies included in this review were single-case experimental design, the reviewers caution that the results might not generalize to other children with CP(2) \u2013Authors of a systematic review published in 2017 examined 17 research articles that investigated speech, language, and communication therapy for children aged 0 to 2 years with CP (or who were considered high risk for CP). The authors of this review reported that there were no studies that yielded high quality evidence. Overall, the evidence for speech, language, and communication interventions in this population is low. The interventions with the most promising evidence were responsivity training,prelinguistic milieu teaching, and similar types of parent\u2013infant  interaction training programs(73)",
            "Improving communication interactions by training communication partners:  Parents/caregivers are trained in ways to facilitate communication. Intervention might include training on ways to: \u2013Improve physical positioning during interactions(5) \u2013Decrease parent/caregiver\u2019s use of directive language(5) \u2013Improve parent/caregiver\u2019s ability to read child\u2019s communication signals(5) \u2013Improve parent/caregiver\u2019s ability to imitate child\u2019s communication attempts(5) \u2013Increase parent/caregiver\u2019s use of open-ended questions(5) \u2013Provide more communicative opportunities(7) \u2013Wait for a clear communication signal from their child(7) \u2013Recognize their child\u2019s communication signal(7)  \u2013Improve parent/caregiver\u2019s ability to shape a more advanced communication signal(7) \u2013Authors of a published systematic review that included 4 research studies on children with CP documented consistent, positive changes in the interaction patterns of parents/caregivers who had participated in interaction training. These positive changes included improvements in physical positioning during conversation, decreased amounts of physical direction by mothers, increased use of open questions, improvements in infants\u2019 voluntary responses, and improvements in infants\u2019 vocalization. Further research in this area is needed due to significant methodological flaws in each of the 4 studies(5) \u2013In a study on indirect intervention conducted in the United States for children with CP, three caregiver-child  dyads were seen twice a week for 3 weeks. These visits were primarily treatment sessions, but also included observations of the dyads\u2019 communication. The children involved in this study were between the ages of 14 and 21 months and had significant motor and communication impairments. Results showed that all the caregivers participating in the intervention learned to 1) increase their use of communication opportunities, 2) wait for a communication signal from their child, and 3) recognize and respond to their child\u2019s communication attempts. Although parents/caregivers were also taught to use shaping, only small increases in parents\u2019 use of shaping were seen. Shaping occurs when a child produces a communicative behavior and his or her adult communication partner recognizes that behavior (e.g., eye gaze), decides which more sophisticated behavior is within the child\u2019s reach (e.g., eye gaze plus reach), and attempts to sculpt that desired behavior(7) \u2013It Takes Two to Talk (Developed by the Hanen Centre)(41) -Program used widely throughout the United Kingdom; focuses on early interaction training for parents of young children with CP(41) -In a study conducted in the United Kingdom involving 11 families in which there was a child with a severe motor disability (10 of these children had CP, one had a myopathy), researchers examined the effectiveness of the It Takes Two to Talk program in increasing communication between parent and child with disability(41) -Children were between the ages of 1;7 and 3;0 at the start of the study; all of the children had a history of severe delay in reaching gross and fine motor milestones as well as moderate to severe communication disorders(41) -Each family nominated one caregiver to participate in the training program; in all cases, the family member nominated was the mother(41) -The It Takes Two to Talk training took place over seven or eight 150-minute  group sessions and three home visits over approximately 13 weeks(41) -Prior to training, conversations between the mother and child were most often initiated and directed by the mother; children responded to mothers\u2019 directives and made few requests during conversations(41) -Following the training, researchers found that although conversations between the mother and child were still largely mother-directed,  the mothers had all become more responsive to the children and less directive and the children initiated more conversations and exerted more control over conversations(41)",

Articulation intervention is advised only if other aspects of speech production are/have been addressed(3) \u2013Exercises include:(3) -Patient focuses on starting to speak at the beginning of exhalation on two types of simple phrases -Patient practices breathing in order to regulate intensity and mark stress appropriately in regular phrases -Patient increases breath control for connected, conversational speech -Patient completes individualized articulation exercises as appropriate \u2013Teaching components include:(3) -Therapist introduces each exercise -Therapist models therapy activities -Therapist reinforces correct behavior -Therapist records results \u2013In a published research study conducted in the United Kingdom, 6 children (10\u201318  years old) with mild to severe dysarthria received 5 weeks of speech intervention incorporating the abovementioned exercises and teaching components. All children had significant motor involvement, and 2 had moderate learning disabilities. During the 5 weeks of  intervention, each child was seen for individual therapy 5 days a week for 20\u201330  minutes per session. Treatment followed a systems approach and focused on discussing breathing techniques, teaching correct seating and posture, and instructing students to start speaking at the beginning of exhalations. At the end of the 5 weeks of intervention, 4 students had improved single-word  intelligibility. However, at a 7-week  follow-up  session, all but 1 student\u2019s single-word  intelligibility had returned to pre-treatment levels. Before receiving the 5 weeks of intervention, most of the students were more intelligible in connected speech than in single-word  productions. Improvements in connected speech intelligibility following treatment were not statistically significant. The authors of this study hypothesized that failure of some children to maintain changes was due to the repeated practice of single skills instead of random practice of several skills(3) \u2013Another study conducted in the United States involved 16 children with CP (ages 12\u201318  years) and moderate to severe dysarthria(42) -The children in the study each received three individual sessions (35\u201340  minutes) of speech therapy per week at school for 6 weeks(42) -Systems approach was used; intervention protocol had been developed in previous research studies and focused on stabilizing respiratory and phonatory effort and control, speech rate and phrase length, or syllables per breath(42) -Researchers assessed speech intelligibility 6 weeks prior to the intervention, immediately prior to intervention, and immediately after intervention(42) -No change was observed in the 6 weeks prior to intervention; however, immediately following intervention, speech intelligibility at the single-word  level increased by at least 10% for most of the children(42)",

Results indicated that both children improved their articulation of four target phonemes at the end of intervention. The child receiving phonetic-based  treatment made more progress by the end of intervention but showed more regression at 2-month  follow-up.  The child receiving phonological-based  intervention made less progress between each session, but that child\u2019s progress was more stable and showed less regression at follow-up(43)",

At the beginning of the 4-year  study, none of the children had any intelligible speech. Intervention was divided into two 2-year  periods. During the first 2-year  period, therapy focused on remediating oral praxis. The only significant result of the first 2 years of intervention was improved voice; due to such limited results, the focus of intervention was changed for the second 2-year  period. During the second 2-year  period, intervention occurred in natural settings and targeted improving phonation, voice, prosody, and posture. Throughout  the 4-year  period, children received ongoing neurodevelopmental treatment, a therapy technique which increases the inhibition of the primary and tonic reflexes in order to improve the functioning of the sensorimotor system. Parents and teachers were given communication training that included education on how to encourage the children\u2019s expressive language skills, attend to the children\u2019s turn-taking  skills, and attend to the children\u2019s attempts at vocal communication. Parents were directly involved in treatment activities with their children 10\u201330  minutes per day. At the end of the second 2-year  period, significant improvements in voice, articulation, prosody, and speech intelligibility were made.

Study participants had speech intelligibility ranging from moderately to severely impaired. Intelligibility was judged by asking a listener to identify a target word in a sentence when given a contextual cue. Results indicated that providing listeners with visual information (i.e., allowing listeners to see speakers\u2019 faces) significantly improved their comprehension of persons with moderately impaired speech. However, among individuals with severely impaired speech, intelligibility was most significantly facilitated when initial letter cues for spoken words were provided. The use of visual cues and repetition without initial letter cues did not significantly improve intelligibility for this group of children. Additionally, results indicated that repeating a message was found to do little to improve intelligibility, even though this strategy was commonly used among study participants. Parents of children with severely impacted intelligibility reported increased frustration when messages were repeated. Even though listeners\u2019 abilities to identify single words in a context increased when various strategies were implemented, results did not determine whether or not information transfer was significantly improved (i.e., whether or not whole message comprehension was improved)(45)",

Two of the 3 children were treated with LSVT LOUD and 1 was treated with traditional dysarthria interventions. The child treated with traditional dysarthria interventions demonstrated improved speech intelligibility without increased SPL(52)",
            "Improving expressive language skills through aided modeling using AAC devices \u2013Therapist models a target language structure (e.g., possession: mom\u2019s hat) using both the child\u2019s AAC device and a spoken model(10) -Occurs in two steps: -Therapist verbally models grammatically correct utterance during a play activity (e.g., \u201cThat\u2019s mom\u2019s hat\u201d) -Therapist then points to two symbols on child\u2019s AAC device used to capture the meaning of the spoken utterance (\u201cmom,\u201d \u201chat\u201d)  -In a study conducted in the United States of 5 preschoolers with CP who used AAC devices, researchers showed that aided modeling increased their ability to express more complex messages. Following treatment involving aided modeling, 4 out of 5 children learned to consistently produce multi-symbol  messages. Additionally, these 4 children displayed generalized, long-term  use of symbol combinations(46) -Authors of a case study with a 19-year-old  German female with CP described the subject\u2019s use of AAC in conversations with familiar partners. Authors noted that the subject combined the use of her electronic device to express semantic information with gestures of head nodding and shaking for confirmations or denials. Additionally, authors noted that the confirmations occurred much more frequently than did denials (i.e., head shaking), which is a pattern that exists among individuals without disabilities as well. The authors of the study recommended the use of detailed transcriptions of conversations between AAC users and familiar partners to develop individual multimedia dictionaries of frequently used terms for use with new (unfamiliar) communication partners(61) -Authors of a case study involving an 8-year-old  girl with quadriplegic athetoid CP and seizure disorder examined the usefulness of the iPad in conversational exchanges between the child and her mother. Researchers specifically focused on how communicative turns were constructed around the use of the iPad and how the child participated in such conversations. Results indicated that the mother carried multiple roles in the conversation\u2014she controlled the use of the iPad, interpreted her child\u2019s responses, and indicated understanding of her child\u2019s conversational turn. Researchers indicated that, at times, using the iPad was less efficient than interpreting the child\u2019s gaze at an object (the video camera, in this instance). They also questioned whether the use of the iPad for yes/no questions was efficient. The researchers suggested that further research is needed to define how children with complex communication needs use different AAC devices. While the iPad and other tablets have a certain level of social acceptance, functionality for the child must be the primary reason for choosing an AAC device(67) \u2013For detailed information on assessment and treatment with AAC devices, see the series of Clinical Reviews on this topic .
