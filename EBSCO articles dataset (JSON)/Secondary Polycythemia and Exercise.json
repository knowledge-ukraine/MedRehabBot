            "Polycythemia is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by red blood cell (RBC) overproduction (i.e., erythrocytosis) that causes an abnormally high RBC mass, indicated by venous hematocrit (Hct) higher than (>) 52% in males or > 48% in females. The annual incidence of polycythemia in the United States is fewer than3 in 100,000 persons each year. There is no cure(1,2)",
            "Cases are either primary (hereditary) or secondary (acquired). Polycythemia vera (PV), the most common inherited form, is a true blood cancer of bone marrow caused by JAK2 mutation.(1) The recently proposed World Health Organization (WHO) diagnosis of PV establishes the Hct threshold at > 49% for men and > 48% for women, equivalent to a venous hemoglobin level > 18.0 g/dL in men and > 16.0 g/dL in women. The prevalence of PV is approximately 22 per 100,000 persons(2)",
            "Abnormal proliferation of other hematopoietic bone marrow elements is often found and patients are prone to developing splenomegaly, leukocytosis, thrombocythemia, and bleeding. PV is associated with reduced survival(2)",
            "Secondary (acquired) polycythemia usually results from elevated serum erythropoietin (Epo) due to medical comorbidities associated with chronic hypoxia. Patients with polycythemia and a high Epo level but are negative for JAK2 mutations have secondary erythrocytosis (i.e., elevated Epo rules out PV).(3) In either case, the elevated RBC mass causes hyperviscosity of blood in the microcirculation.(4) The reduced peripheral blood flow and oxygen delivery can cause multiple symptoms, including poor exercise tolerance",
            "The mainstay of patient management is phlebotomy (venesection or bloodletting) that aims to keep Hct less than (<) 45%.Drug therapy to reduce RBC production includes hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea) or other myelosuppressive drugs, a JAK2 inhibitor,and/or low-dose  acetylsalicylic acid(1)",
            "Individualized moderate exercise training may lessen symptoms (fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep) and improve quality of life in persons with PV(19)"

            "PV is almost always due to mutations in JAK2  exons 12 or 14 ( JAK2 V617F). Lack of a JAK2  mutation, combined withnormal or increased serum Epo, makes the diagnosis of PV unlikely. The JAK2  mutation produces overexpression oftyrosine kinase, which activates Epo and thrombopoietin receptors in bone marrow. This allows reduced negative feedbackon inflammatory cytokines and growth factors involved in RBC production(1)",
            "Secondary or acquired polycythemia is associated with conditions of chronic hypoxia, often due to heavy smoking,obstructive lung disease, cyanotic heart disease, or postrenal transplantation(1)",
            "Administration of Epoor exposure to high-altitude  increases erythrocytosis that, if excessive and with accompanyingdehydration, could lead to acquired polycythemia(3)"

            "Microcirculatory abnormalities that cause the major pathophysiological problems result mainly from the abnormallyhigh RBC mass. The primary concerns are capillary hypoperfusion(i.e., \u201csludging\u201d) in the extremities and blood clots.A potential treatment strategy for improving peripheral blood flow in patients is individualized aerobic exercise training(ET) to promote angiogenesis (i.e., capillary growth). For example, authors of a comparative study (n = 40 patients withintermittent claudication) in Germany found that supervised ET was superior to non-supervised ET at 7.65months follow-upfor increasing proangiogenic cells and walking distance(6)",
            "The high viscosity of blood (or plasma) and changes in clotting factors also contribute to \u201csludging\u201d andthrombohemorrhagic complications such as stroke, myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism.PV therefore increases risk of perioperative thrombosis and hemorrhage during surgical procedures(4)",
            "The hyperviscosity alters blood flow dynamics, which heightens central blood pressure (BP) and increases left ventricular(LV) afterload. The greater LV workload is associated with higher cardiovascular risk. Authors of a case series (n = 16patients with PV) in Australia found that venesection followed by plasma volume replacement decreased viscosity andimproved LV systolic function and reduced central BP during light-exercise(7)",
            "PV impairs muscle perfusion and peripheral oxygen delivery that reduces exercise performance. This is unlike themoderate erythrocytosis induced by Epo administration or residence at high-altitude  that can increase oxygen carryingcapacity (affinity) of the blood and potentially improve aerobic exercise performance(1,4,7)",
            "Authors of a descriptive study (n = 1788 patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms and a high persistence, prevalence,and severity of fatigue) in the United States found that comorbidities associated with greater fatigue included restless legsyndrome, diabetes mellitus, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, and chronic kidney disease(8,21)",

            "Although there is no cure, the prognosis is good for patients with medically-managed,  controlled polycythemia. However, median survival time for persons with PV in the absence of therapy is less than 3 years(14)",
            "Thrombosis has been reported in 15 to 60% of patients, also depending on the control. It is the major cause of death in 10% to 40% of patients. Venous and arterial thromboses have resulted in pulmonary emboli, renal failure from renal vein or artery thrombosis, intestinal ischemia from mesenteric vein thromboses, or peripheral arterial emboli(15)",
            "Authors of a randomized clinical trial (n = 365 patients with PV) in Italy found that those with a Hct target of < 45% had a significantly lower rate of cardiovascular death and major thrombosis after a median follow-up  of 31 months than did those with a Hct target of 45 to 50%(16)",

            "Guidelines: specific exercise guidelines are not available for patients with polycythemia. Exercise standards for testing and training patients in general have been published by the American College of Sports Medicine(11) \u2013To ensure safety, a physician, clinical exercise physiologist, or physical therapist should conduct the exercise test, write the exercise prescription, and supervise the exercise program \u2013Research is lacking on exercise programs specifically designed for patients with polycythemia. As with other high-risk patients with cardiovascular disease, aerobic ET should likely be the primary focus to develop cardiovascular fitness, enhance peripheral blood flow, and potentially induce angiogenesis(6) \u2013The usual modes of supervised aerobic ET are indicated: stationary leg cycling, arm ergometry, and walking on a treadmill (ambulatory patients with questionable DGI results may require standby assistance when walking on a treadmill). The home exercise program should include easy walking. A targeted goal of 10,000 steps a day (measured with a pedometer) is indicated by research in Australia. Authors of a cohort study of free-living  adults (n = 2,576) residing in Tasmania found that those who increased to 10,000 steps a day were associated with a significantly lower (46%) risk of mortality in the decade of follow-up  than those who remained sedentary(18)",
            "Patient orientation : The initial 2 weeks of the training program should be used to familiarize the patient to the training modes while exercising at \u201clight\u201d or \u201ceasy\u201d RPE intensity, with the session relatively short in duration (15 to 20 minutes)",
            "Warm-up : Allow for a warm-up  period of at least 15 minutes of gentle exercise, which may include light calisthenics and stretching, prior to starting exercise in the prescribed aerobic training intensity",
            "Exercise intensity : Avoid exercise-induced symptoms such as muscle pain or dyspnea that may limit exercise duration. For most patients with controlled polycythemia, a moderate-intensity  upper limit (in the absence of untoward signs or symptoms) can be 60% to 70% of age-predicted  maximal HR or peak HR observed on graded exercise testing. This intensity is commonly perceived as \u201cfairly light\u201d to \u201csomewhat hard\u201d (11 to 13 on RPE Scale of 6 to 20)",
            "Exercise session duration : Target 40 minutes after the initial orientation period",
            "Exercise frequency : Target 3 times of supervised ET per week . Problem Goal Intervention Expected Progression Home Program  Poor cardiovasular fitness; high risk of thrombohemorrhagic complicationsImproved fitness; daily physical activityExercise Training  See outline under Treatment Summary  aboveThe intensity, duration, and frequency of ET should be progressed to the maintenance level compatible with health promotionProvide the patient with simple written instructions for safe independent ET at home ."
