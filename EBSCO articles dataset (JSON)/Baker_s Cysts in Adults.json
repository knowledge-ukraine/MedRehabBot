            "The term popliteal cyst (also called Baker\u2019s cyst) indicates the benign enlargement of a bursa in the posterior knee due to collection of synovial fluid from the knee capsule. It usually is characterized by minor swelling of the popliteal fossa, which in most cases is asymptomatic. Severe swelling may, however, cause discomfort due to compression of a nerve or blood vessel(1,14)",
            "The involved bursa typically is found in the medial aspect of the popliteal fossa between the semimembranosus tendon and the medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle, just below crease of knee. This gastrocnemius-semimembranosus  bursa is unique because it communicates with the knee joint via an opening (one-way  valve effect) in the joint capsule posterior to the medial femoral condyle(4,13)",
            "The majority of adult popliteal cysts are associated with primary osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee, meniscus tears, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) insufficiency, and/or chondral lesions(14)"
