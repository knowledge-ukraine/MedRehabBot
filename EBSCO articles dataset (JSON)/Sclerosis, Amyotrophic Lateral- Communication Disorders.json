Includes 21 quantitative tasks and 15 rating-scale  tasks that are used to determine the severity of a patient\u2019s dysarthria and make recommendations for treatmentAs ALS progresses, patients will experience a decline in their speech rate and intelligibility. This decline may continue until a person is completely unintelligible. Researchers have documented that once a patient\u2019s speaking rate drops to 100 words per minute, intelligibility will significantly decrease. Careful monitoring of speech rate will enable the SLP, patient, and family/caregiver to make the necessary preparations for use of AAC(24)Complete informal and standardized assessments of receptive and expressive language. Language skills of patients with ALS can be impaired (sometimes subtly) at any stage of the disease, even in the absence of overt cognitive dysfunction.(25) In a study conducted in the United Kingdom with 51 patients with ALS and 35 healthy controls, researchers found that language impairment was evident in 43% of the patients with ALS and that executive functioning was impaired in 31% of these patients(45) -For detailed information about evaluation of language abilities and aphasia, see the series of Clinical Reviews on this topic \u2013VoiceCan include measurements of nasal airflow, nasal airway resistance, velopharyngeal timing and movement, and velopharyngeal orifice size(20) -Velopharyngeal status in patients with ALS can be determined with good accuracy through the use of local sensors in a nasal cannula at the anterior nares connected to a device that measures nasal ram pressure(26)Acoustic signal analysis provides quantitative information related to perceptual judgments and can be used to confirm phonetic error patterns. A computerized signal processing system can be used to study the F2 slope, F1-F2  vowel space calculations, and acoustic energy. These three acoustic measures are known to be sensitive to changes in vowel and consonant articulation in speakers with dysarthria. Over the course of treatment, acoustic signal analysis can be used to quantify and measure changes(27)Abnormalities of breath patterns and respiratory incompetence often compromise speech production in patients with ALS.(47) Breath pattern observations should note irregular breathing rates; the absence of normal inhalation-exhalation  patterns; the initiation of speaking at atypical points in the respiratory cycle; the interruption of speech from sudden, forced inspiratory/expiratory sighs; exaggerated respiratory maneuvers; running out of air before inhaling; and breathing at syntactically inappropriate locations in the utterance(20)A brief reading assessment in patients with ALS is appropriate as reading ability should factor into the choice of AAC method",

            "oral structure and oral motor function": "Fasciculations in the tongue typically are one of the earliest clinical markers of ALS.(47) For patients presenting for reduced speech intelligibility without a known diagnosis, it is essential to communicate to the ordering physician when tongue fasciculations are observed during the patient\u2019s evaluation. Other common findings in patients with ALS are drooling, hypernasal voice quality/nasal emission, and loss of lingual range of motion.(47) It is important to examine the speech structures and musculature at rest and during movement as well as during both speech and nonspeech tasks.(28) For motor speech disorders, such as flaccid dysarthria, the following six items should be carefully",

Patients with ALS in whom frontotemporal dementia has not been diagnosed might also exhibit cognitive impairments such as difficulties with verbal fluency, language comprehension, memory, abstract reasoning, and generalized impairments in intellectual function.(4) Refer to neuropsychological and cognitive evaluations to assist in informing course of treatment and providing a prognosis for therapyPatients with frontotemporal dementia associated with ALS sometimes exhibit deficits in cognitive and language functioning that interact to make functional communication difficult -A patient\u2019s inability to attend to, perceive, organize, and remember information will impact receptive and expressive language skills -Difficulties with problem solving and executive functioning negatively affect functional communication; it is important that the SLP assess ways in which cognitive-linguistic  difficulties affect the patient\u2019s ability to communicate in social, academic, and/or vocational situations -A cognitive-linguistic  assessment should also consider how various communication tasks can be modified in order to support a patient\u2019s functional communication(17) \u2013Researchers who conducted a study in the United States with 41 patients with ALS found that cognitive impairments in ALS were related to cortical thinning in the prefrontal and parietal cortex(18) \u2013In a study conducted in the United States with 25 patients with ALS, researchers found that patients with poor scores on a letter fluency test had a reduced ratio of N-acetylaspartate  (NAA) to creatine-phosphocreatinine  (Cr) in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex as seen on magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)(44)",

This is due to the fact that speech intelligibility rapidly and significantly declines once a patient\u2019s speaking rate is 55\u201370%  of average.(6,24,36) Speaking rate may be monitored from a distance through the use of a telephone and computer software programs in order to decrease the number of visits a patient must make to a clinic while ensuring a timely AAC assessment.(41) Authors of a systematic review on communication abilities in ALS emphasized the need for early assessment for and training in the use of AAC to maximize quality of life throughout disease progression(62) -Researchers in the United States conducted a study of 50 patients with ALS that revealed that 96% of participants accepted AAC technology either immediately or with some delay. Patients who accepted the devices immediately decided to purchase devices as soon as an AAC assessment was completed and began using the device as soon as  possible. Patients who had \u201cdelayed acceptance\u201d either did not immediately schedule an AAC assessment or did not purchase a device immediately following the assessment. However, eventually patients in the delayed acceptance group did undergo an AAC assessment, purchase a device, and use it to communicate. The 2 patients who did not accept AAC devices exhibited symptoms of dementia and cognitive limitations that were cited as the reasons for their rejection of the technology(39) -Clinical practices that lead to favorable outcomes with AAC device use include:(39) -Patient/family are provided with information on the speech-language characteristics associated with ALS -Speech changes are monitored through ongoing contact with the patient so that the timing of interventions is optimal -Patient/family education is provided continuously -Researchers in the United States conducted a study of 45 patients with ALS that revealed that patients with primary bulbar ALS used their AAC devices for 25 months and patients with spinal (limb) ALS used their devices for an average of 34.2 months.
