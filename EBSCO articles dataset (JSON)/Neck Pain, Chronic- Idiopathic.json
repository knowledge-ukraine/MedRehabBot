The benefits included reduced pain, improved function, and global perceived effect(35)",

Emphasis was on strengthening and lengthening the neck and shoulder muscles and improving neck stability and overall posture. Patients were instructed to practice their yoga exercises at home for 10 minutes a day -The exercise group received a self-care  exercise manual and was instructed to practice exercises 10 minutes daily -Patients in the yoga group reported significantly less neck pain and disability and greater quality of life as measured by the NDI and SF-36  compared to the exercise group. ROM and proprioceptive acuity improved significantly in the yoga group compared to the exercise group. There was no significant change in ROM, proprioceptive acuity, disability, or quality of life in the exercise group pre and post intervention \u2013Patients who participated in neck strengthening and endurance exercises maintained the positive gains in ROM, strength, and pressure pain threshold at 3 years post-initial treatment intervention (27) -Finnish researchers conducted a randomized controlled trial that included 118 women with nonspecific CNP -Patients participated in neck strengthening and endurance exercises and were followed up at 12 months and 3 years to reassess neck pain, disability, ROM, and pain pressure threshold -There were no additional statistically significant improvements made between the 12-month  follow-up  and 3-year follow-up;  however, the improvements recorded at the 12-month  follow-up  were maintained at the 3-year  follow-up -Researchers concluded that a 12-month  exercise program is adequate to maintain long-term  effects and that exercises may not need to be performed regularly for the remainder of the subject\u2019s life \u2013Gentle training of the deep cervical flexors (longus capitis and longus colli were targeted) increased their activation, improved cervical angle in sitting, and reduced V AS pain ratings compared to \u201cendurance-strength\u201d  training of the dominant superficial flexors (anterior scalene and sternocleidomastoid)(2,28,29,30,47) \u2013Researchers in Korea investigated the effects of neurac (neuromuscular activation) training on pain, function, fatigability, balance ability, and quality of life with CNP patients(48) -Neurac consists of tailored exercises and techniques in suspension slings which aim to restore pain-free and functional movement patterns through high levels of neuromuscular stimulation -Twenty subjects with neck pain for at least 3 months; 10 in the experimental group and 10 in the control group participated. Neurac training was conducted 3 times per week for 4 weeks -V AS and NDI scores, sway length and velocity with eyes open and closed, and fatigue symptom scores all decreased significantly",
            "Manual therapy \u2013Manual nonmanipulative mobilization techniques (not including massage) may reduce pain,(31) and mobilization plus exercise appears to provide greater long-term benefits(4) \u2013In a 2010 systematic review that included 17 randomized controlled trials, researchers concluded the following:(32) -High-quality  evidence indicates that manual therapy and exercise therapy separately provide the same long-term  (12 months) positive outcomes in persons with acute or chronic neck pain, even though manual therapy is associated with more immediate (4 weeks) pain relief -Moderate-quality  evidence indicates greater pain reduction and improved QOL when exercise and manual therapy are combined than for manual therapy alone  \u2013Manipulation of the cervical and thoracic spine can improve disability related to chronic mechanical CNP but not necessarily improve ROM or pain in the short term(42) -Based on a randomized controlled study conducted in the United States in which 82 patients were assigned to a cervical spine manipulation group or a full manipulation group that received mid-cervical, cervico-thoracic,  and thoracic joint manipulations -Neck pain intensity, NDI, and cervical ROM were calculated at baseline and 1 week following joint manipulation -Patients who received the full manipulation reported greater reduction in disability than those in the cervical group, whereas both groups reported similar reduction in neck pain and increases in cervical ROM \u2013The addition of thoracic spine thrust manipulations to non-thrust  cervical manipulations can improve short-term outcomes in patients with CNP -Based on a randomized trial that compared two groups but did not include controls(38) -The experimental group received spinal thrusts (x2) targeted to T1-T3  and T4-T7  in one treatment session while the comparison group received only the non-thrust  cervical manipulation -Numeric pain and disability ratings improved more in the experimental group than the comparison group at 1-week follow-up \u2013Authors of a 2016 RCT study in Italy suggest that patients with CNP may benefit more from a global postural reeducation (GPR) program than manual therapy (MT) treatment alone(49) -Ninety six subjects with CNP were included (74 women, 22 men) -Patients were randomized to either the GPR group or the MT group -Both groups received 9 sessions of 60 minute treatments -Outcome measures used in this study included the V AS, NDI, assessment of ROM, and kinesiophobia (Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia) -Those in the GPR group showed significant differences in pain reduction and disability (after 6 months) compared to those in the MT group",

            "Other options \u2013Use of orthopedic pillow can improve patient outcomes; however, it is not independently effective(33) -Based on a randomized controlled trial conducted in Canada that included 151 subjects with CNP -Subjects who received neck strengthening exercises in conjunction with the use of an orthopedic pillow achieved the most improvement compared to the subjects who received exercises and placebo (hot/cold packs and massage), exercises, placebo and pillow, or pillow and placebo \u2013Evidence is lacking or of poor quality to support workplace intervention for relief of CNP or preventing work-related musculoskeletal disorders in the neck and shoulder(14,15,36) "
