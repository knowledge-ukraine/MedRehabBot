            "AAC is a system for communication that supplements or replaces verbal communication (speech) and includes four main components: symbols, aids, strategies, and techniques(1,2) \u2013Symbols can include objects, drawings, photographs, and orthography (written language; e.g., words, letters, sentences)(1) \u2013Aids can be relatively simple or complex devices for transmitting or receiving messages (e.g., communication board, letter board, electronic speech-generating  device [SGD])(1) \u2013Strategies refer to the methods by which the symbols can be conveyed in the easiest and most efficient manner (e.g., keyboard layout)(1) \u2013Techniques refer to the ways in which the messages are selected for transmission (e.g., direct selection, scanning)(1)",
            "TBI refers to a blunt or penetrating brain injury that results in a disruption of brain function. Trauma can be focal (localized) or diffuse (involving a large part of the brain). Injury from a TBI occurs in two stages, the primary injury and the secondary injury. In the primary injury, tissue damage can occur at the injury site (coup injury) and 180\u00ba across from the initial injury (contrecoup injury). Primary injury can be caused by skull fracture, contusions (bruising), hematomas, lacerations (tearing of lobes or blood vessels of the brain), and/or damage from shearing or cutting of nerve fibers.(3) Secondary injury refers to the damage caused by the normal physiologic responses to an initial head injury, including inflammation, fever, edema, hemorrhage, and decreased cerebral blood flow.(4) Secondary injury can also occur in the form of posttraumatic, chronic seizures following the initial head injury.(5) For detailed information on different levels of recovery from TBI, please see the series of Clinical Reviews on TBI and the Ranchos Los Amigos levels of cognitive functioning. For detailed information on dysphagia associated with TBI, please see Clinical Review\u2026Dysphagia: Traumatic Brain Injury in Adult Patients ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T709012and Clinical Review\u2026Dysphagia: Traumatic Brain Injury in Pediatric Patients ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T709008",
            "Communication difficulties associated with TBI include motor speech problems, specific language impairments, and cognitive-based language impairments.(6,7) Other symptoms  of TBI include behavioral, motor, visual, perceptual, and personality changes that may also affect communication(8)",
            "Pragmatic skills such as prosody, affect, topic selection, topic maintenance, turn-taking,  conciseness, and fluency are often affected by TBI(9) \u2013Poor conversational turn-taking  occurs frequently because patients with TBI often do not recognize or will misinterpret both verbal and nonverbal signals from conversational partners (e.g., natural pauses for emotion, eye contact, body language)(50)",
            "For patients with TBI, AAC use might be short-term  (during the recovery period) or permanent(1,7)",
            "Patients with TBI who use AAC systems have been categorized into three different types of communicators at the final stage of recovery: 1) dependent communicators, those who have significant residual cognitive and motor impairments and require partners to support their use of AAC; 2) cued communicators, those who have residual cognitive impairment and require minimal support to use AAC systems, particularly in environments outside of the home; and 3) independent communicators, those who can initiate interactions with familiar and unfamiliar partners in a variety of settings(6)"

            "In a study conducted in the United States of 25 patients with TBI, the most common form of both low-tech  and high-tech systems involved letter-by-letter  spelling(7)",
            "Other strategies to encode messages (e.g., selecting pre-programmed messages) might be more difficult for the patient with TBI due to cognitive difficulties(7)",
            "Speech recovery often occurs as cognitive impairment decreases (as the patient reaches Rancho Los Amigos Level V or VI).(7) However, speech recovery is variable and has been categorized into three patterns: 1) rapid recovery of functional speech skills, 2) recovery of speech skills after motor speech intervention, and 3) little or no recovery of functional speech several years post injury(7)",
            "Although there is a large body of research about the various types of AAC that are available for persons with TBI, there is minimal information about the effectiveness of interventions to improve cognitive-communication  abilities(52)",
            "The following treatment principles have been recommended for intervention with patients with TBI and AAC: \u2013Due to the changing effects of TBI, particularly during the acute phase of recovery, assessment should be ongoing and dynamic.(6) Whenever possible, strategies and technologies should be changeable and adaptable to increase the likelihood that the AAC will meet the frequently changing needs and abilities of a patient with TBI(41) \u2013Natural motor responses (e.g., pointing) should be used initially for communication to minimize learning demands(6) \u2013The patient\u2019s residual strengths should be utilized in treatment(6) \u2013Family and caregivers should be involved in both assessment and treatment(6) \u2013Treatment should occur in naturalistic settings (e.g., work, home) when possible(13)",
            "Partner-assisted  communication techniques: Partner-assisted  communication techniques may be needed during the initial stages of recovery \u2013The following is a list of common partner-assisted communication techniques: -Yes/no system: The patient responds \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d to a partner\u2019s question. The responses can be natural (e.g., head nod, vocal response) or systems that require training (e.g., eye gaze system, pointing to yes/no cards, depressing a switch with a buzzer). Training of a yes/no system is done through repetition, modeling, and reinforcement by the SLP and other persons in the patient\u2019s environment(31) -Written-choice  communication: Involves a communicative partner selecting topics of interest and initiating interaction using written word choices to facilitate responses from the person with TBI. The person with TBI is provided with written word choices or graphic rating scales to point to when responding to questions. This method is dependent on the reading ability of the patient(2,10) -Augmented input techniques: As the conversational partner speaks, he or she can support the meaning by drawing and writing. This input occurs online during conversation(10) -Tagged yes/no questions: To facilitate the patient\u2019s responses to yes/no questions, the conversational partner adds a question tag (\u201cyes or no\u201d) at the end of the question, leaving a pause between \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno.\u201d The verbal questions can be accompanied by a gesture (thumbs up or thumbs down) and appropriate intonation. The patient can then nod, gesture, or give verbal responses(10) -Cued question-asking:  The conversational partner cues the patient to ask a question to promote active participation in conversation(10) \u2013In a multicenter, nonrandomized controlled trial conducted in Australia with 29 participants with severe TBI and their regular conversational partners, researchers investigated the effects of social communication training for the conversational partners. Fourteen dyads were allocated to the experimental group and 15 to a control group. Treatment for the experimental group took place over 10 weeks and consisted of 2.5 hours of weekly group sessions (4 to 5 dyads) and 1-hour  individual sessions. The goal of the experimental intervention was to maximize communicative effectiveness by reducing the effects of cognitive-linguistic  deficits in conversation. The conversational partners were trained to support the patient with TBI in conversation (e.g., using positive question style, applying collaborative turn-taking)  in tasks such  as role-play  and video feedback. Pre- and postintervention casual conversations were analyzed using exchange structure analysis and productivity analysis as baseline and outcome measures. The postintervention analysis revealed significant reductions in the use of negative questioning behaviors by those conversational partners in the experimental group as well as significant increases in productivity by the subjects with TBI in the experimental group, resulting in more effective communication(44) \u2013In another multicenter trial conducted in Australia with the same communication partner training protocol, the researchers sought to determine which type of training was more effective for improving communication with a person who has a TBI: partner training or individual sessions focusing on the patient only.(46) In this study, 44 outpatients from three different brain injury rehabilitation centers were participants. For those allocated to the communication partner training protocol, the participant\u2019s primary communication partner was trained in effective social communication skills. Using the same protocol as described in the above study, conversation partners participated in 10 weeks of group and individual sessions along with the participants with TBI. In the individual treatment group, only the participants with TBI received training; in the control group there was no training involved. The primary outcome measure was an adapted version of the Measure of Participation in Conversation (MPC), which indicated that the communication partner training significantly improved conversational performance whereas training only the person with TBI and no intervention did not. Results were maintained at a 6-month  postintervention follow-up  session as well(46)",
            "Computer-based  AAC/SGDs: SGDs have been classified into two main types: devices that allow for formation of new messages and devices that use word or whole-phrase  retrieval of prerecorded messages. Caregivers and patients should be involved in selecting the device \u2013Factors to consider when selecting a device include:(10) -Appearance: The assessment team and patient should consider the size, type of pictures (e.g., symbolic, photographs), and hardware required. For example, a person who is mobile might want a smaller device, whereas a person who is in a wheelchair might need a larger display for ease of use -Symbols should be culturally and individually relevant (e.g., if the patient participates in religious activities, options to allow for communication in these situations should be included) -Accessibility and ease of use: Many patients have paralysis or hemiparesis and portability should be considered. Can the patient use the device while holding it at the same time? Can the patient carry the device? -V oice quality: Is the voice quality clear? Does the patient have any difficulty perceiving the voice? -Effectiveness: Is the device effective for the patient\u2019s needs? -Dynamic screen technology or static display -Language demands: How are messages composed? Letters, single words, text plus symbols, phrases, sentences, visual scenes? \u2013In a study conducted in the United States with 9 adults with severe TBI, researchers found that adding computerized text-to-speech  (TTS) software to a reading task significantly improved reading efficiency without compromising reading comprehension for these patients. The rationale behind TTS software is that persons with reading difficulties will be able to hear and see the letter/sound correspondence as well as hear sight words that cannot be easily sounded out. Additionally, researchers believe that reading while listening can reduce the cognitive load required for decoding words while reading, thereby increasing efficiency. In the abovementioned study, each participant attended six experimental sessions during which he or she was taught how to use the TTS feature on a computer. Four passages were read during each session\u2014two with TTS and two without\u2014and after each passage the participants answered 5 questions about the passage. Researchers reported that data collected from all of the sessions indicated that the reading rate was faster for the TTS condition than it was without TTS and that using TTS did not affect reading comprehension(45)",
            "Stored information systems/low-technology  interventions: Stored information systems such as a communication board, book, or remnant book allow the patient to independently access items for communication or access items with a partner\u2019s assistance. Pictures or words are personalized to meet the needs of the patient. Words can be divided into categories and placed in a small notebook or on a single piece of cardboard so that the patient can access it easily. A remnant book which contains actual items of a patient\u2019s past experiences (e.g., photographs, tickets) can be used to engage others in conversation.(2) One criticism of such devices is that they may lack personalization and contextualization.(33) Common needs typically are included in a communication device such as items depicting pain, hunger, and food choices; however, items that convey information to maintain social closeness, transfer new ideas, or express social etiquette may be deemphasized. The use of personalized visual scenes can assist the patient in conversing with a partner about topics of interest. Information manuals and free visual scenes for PC users are available online.(34) Emergency response systems  might be appropriate for a patient who is unable to clearly communicate the need for help in an emergency but is otherwise safe to be at home alone(41) \u2013In all cases, patients who use AAC for communication should have a low-tech  component to their AAC system.(47) Because batteries and computers fail, no patient should only be trained in the use of an electronic device to communicate.(47) In addition to technology failures, the clinician must consider that one AAC device or method cannot meet all of a patient\u2019s communication needs for all possible situations and speakers; hence, a low-tech option (or multiple low-tech  options) should always be provided.(2,47) There is no one low-tech  option that works best for all patients; it is important to trial several different speech supplementation methods and determine which type increases speech intelligibility/functional communication the most(48) -Low-tech  options include: -pen and paper -iconic gestures(48) -low-tech  eye gaze board (a board with topics, letters, pictures, or symbols spread out into different quadrants so the patient can use eye gaze with a partner to communicate)(47) -alphabet supplementation board (a board with the alphabet written on it so the speaker can indicate the first letter of the word he or she is trying to say when communication breakdowns occur)(47,48) -topic/semantic supplementation board (a board with frequently used and personally meaningful conversation topics or pictures on it so the speaker can indicate the topic to the listener, thereby increasing listener comprehension)(48)",
            "Facilitated communication:  In the 1990s, an AAC strategy called facilitated communication was widely promoted as a method for helping a nonverbal person to indicate letters, words, phrases, or sentences using a computer, typewriter, or alphabet board. The facilitator uses manual prompting to support the communicator\u2019s hand in selecting the letters or phrases. Multiple research studies have found that there is no scientific evidence that this method is effective or valid; blind studies in which the facilitators are asked different questions than the patient demonstrate that facilitators often unintentionally select the message for the patient rather than assist the patient in creating his or her own messages(35) . Problem Goal Intervention Expected Progression Home Program  Limited communication; speech/articulation difficulties (Rancho Los Amigos Level III)Stimulate consistent responses; begin to use meaningful communicationAAC intervention to stimulate consistent responses and meaningful communication _ During initial stage of recovery, the SLP may assist in identifying the patient\u2019s response modes and maximizing consistency of patient\u2019s responses. It is important to keep communication simple because overstimulation may exacerbate agitation in the patient.(8) The family and caregivers should be included in all assessment and trials. The SLP should counsel the caregivers/family and rehabilitation team on the communicative needs and status of the patient.(6) Examples of communicative techniques that the patient might use at this time include head nods, pointing, eye gaze, and responding to yes/no questions(8)Progression will depend on patient\u2019s skills with the main purpose of stimulating communication. Example: The patient will maximize consistent responses to yes/no questionsAll persons in the patient\u2019s environment (rehab specialists, doctors, caregivers) should be aware of the method of communication used by patient and be able to support communication Limited communication; speech/articulation difficulties. Patient may be in a confused and agitated state and have difficulty focusing (Rancho Los Amigos levels IV and V)Convey wants and needs in a particular setting with familiar partnersAAC intervention to convey wants and needs in restricted setting _ Aided as well as unaided methods of communication should be considered. Examples include writing supports, yes/no cards, communication boards, and simple voice-output devices(8)Progression will depend on patient\u2019s skills with the main purpose of assisting the patient to convey wants and needs and increase participation in familiar routinesAll persons in the patient\u2019s environment (rehab specialists, doctors, caregivers) should be aware of the method of communication used by patient and be able to support communication  Limited verbal communication; speech/articulation difficulties. Patient may be socially appropriate but have difficulty communicating efficiently (Rancho levels VI, VII, and VIII)Communicate across a variety of settings with different partnersAAC intervention to convey wants and needs across partners and settings _ Aided as well as unaided methods of communication should be considered if the patient continues to have communication difficulties. Extended trials of AAC should be performed outside of the clinical settingProgression will depend on patient\u2019s skills with the main purpose of assisting the patient to communicate outside of the clinical environmentAll persons in the patient\u2019s environment (rehab specialists, doctors, caregivers) should be aware of the method of communication used by patient and be able to support communication .

        "In a study conducted in the United States investigating long-term  use of AAC with 25 adult patients with TBI, researchers found that the majority of patients (81%) continued to use their high-tech  AAC systems after 3 years; however, 12% had discontinued use because of lack of facilitator support after transitioning to different living settings.(7) The following recommendations have been made to maintain functional use of AAC in patients with TBI and other neurogenic disorders: Counsel the patient and family on AAC options and introduce them before language skills plateau if the need for AAC is anticipated(37) Involve the caregiver in treatment sessions and instruct the caregiver in the use of AAC strategies/device(7) Involve other rehabilitation specialists in co-treatment  and the use of AAC techniques. For example, while working with an OT, the patient may be prompted to request needed items (e.g., razor) using an AAC system(32) Provide functional AAC intervention in the patient\u2019s natural environment (e.g., home, work)(9,13)  Monitor AAC use beyond the training stage and make adaptations as necessary(12)"

        "Subtle communication deficits in patients with TBI may negatively affect patients\u2019 ability to maintain personal relationships. The patient and caregivers/family should be counseled regarding communication deficits, such as poor pragmatic skills, that may be caused by TBI(9)",
