            "Resting (seated) arterial blood pressure (BP) increases with advancing age, most rapidly after age 60, with both systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (SBP) becoming elevated(1)",
            "Seventy percent of persons 65 and older have hypertension (HTN), as compared to 34% of adults ages 45\u201354.(36)HTN is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), although there are many other collateral effects as well (e.g., dementia, physical disability, and falls/fractures).(37)The rate of hospital admissions due to HTN-related  conditions increased in the United States from 1980 to 2007, based on data (N = 4,598,488 hospitalized cases) from the National Hospital Discharge Surveys(13)",

            "Consensus is lacking as to the specific systolic and diastolic blood pressure range recommendations for management of HTN in older adults \u2013The American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Family Physicians published a 2017 guideline suggesting the following for adults \u2265 60 years of age:(31) -Target of SBP < 150 in general population -Target of SBP < 140 if patient has history of stroke or transient ischemic attack -Target of SBP < 140 in patients with cardiovascular risk factors, along with initiation or intensification of HTN management \u2013Two reviews published in 2017 recommended different blood pressure goals, continuing the debate over management of HTN in older adults -Authors of a systematic review indicated that clinical trials suggest that a goal of < 140/80 can positively affect cardiovascular outcomes(32) -Authors of an evidence-based  review suggested a target of < 120 for SBP in community-dwelling  non-diabetic  patients \u2265 75 years of age, if it is achievable without \u201cundue burden\u201d(33) -The authors also suggested that it is better to use two drugs to control HTN rather than increasing the dose of one drug -Authors of a 2017 Cochrane systematic review concluded that there was insufficient evidence to recommend a target BP of less than 140/90 for older adults(34) \u2013According to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC8) (2014), management guidelines for persons with HTN recommend controlling resting BP values below (<) 150 mmHg SBP and between 80 and 90 mmHg DBP.(14)Therapeutic goals of SBP < 130 mmHg and DBP < 65 mmHg for the general population should probably be  avoided in older adults due to associated complications, such as falls possibly due to orthostatic hypotension(1,3) \u2013The Working Group on Women\u2019s Cardiovascular Health strongly disagrees with the JNC8 recommendations to raise the threshold of initiating treatment for older persons, especially because of the effect on women, who are the majority of the older adult population with HTN. The working group notes that the new recommendations put women, especially Black women, at unnecessary excess risk and increase existing sex and racial/ethnic cardiovascular disease disparities(27) -This group suggests adhering to a BP goal of < 140/90 for older women \u2013A 2015 scientific statement from the American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and American Society of Hypertension recommends target blood pressure in uncomplicated HTN of < 140/90 in patients 65 to 79 years old(26)",
