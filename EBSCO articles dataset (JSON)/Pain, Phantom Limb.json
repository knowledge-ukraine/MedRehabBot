            "Phantom limb sensation is the perception of pain in a limb that no longer exists(17)",
            "Phantom limb pain can be described as having a painful sensation associated with the missing body part.(1)It typically begins within the first postsurgical week and then stabilizes after a few months. In some cases, it may not begin until several months or years following the amputation(1) \u2013It can be classified as a type of neuropathic pain(17) \u2013Pain may be reported as very intense pain and may occur as a result of an external or internal stimulus(1) \u2013Pain may also be reported as dull, continuous aching or burning that is not episodic(1)",
            "Stump pain is pain arising from the residual part of the body as opposed to phantom pain, which is felt in the missing part of the body(1) \u2013Stump pain is described as a sharp or sticking sensation or increased pressure that is localized to the end of the stump(1) \u2013The most common cause of stump pain is prosthogenic, with neurogenic pain the second most common cause. Neurogenic pain results from the formation of a neuroma where the nerve was cut during amputation(1)"
