The following -Count backwards from 100 by 3s(6) -Read words that are difficult to pronounce (e.g., statistical, chrysanthemum). After the individual reads the word, have him or her produce the word 3 times in succession, first at a normal rate and then at a faster rate.(6) A person who clutters might have more difficulty pronouncing the words correctly at a faster rate -Read words with changing stress patterns (e.g., economics, economy, economical).(6) A person who clutters might misplace the stressAssess the individual's ability to imitate sentences of varying length and complexity. These tasks provide information on auditory memory and on the level of language complexity at which the individual's communication breaks down. Many standardized tests of language have sentence imitation tasks(6) To determine if cluttering and stuttering coexist, categorize disfluencies into typical nonstuttering disfluencies and stuttering-type  disfluencies by using a tool such as the Systematic Dysfluency Analysis.(10) Stuttering-type  disfluencies include sound or syllable repetitions, prolongations, and blocks. Typical nonstuttering categories include hesitations, interjections, revisions, unfinished words, and phrase repetitions. Word repetitions go in either category(3) -Researchers in the United States compared disfluencies of 18 adults who exhibited cluttering to disfluencies of 20 typically speaking adults and found that types and frequencies of disfluencies are as similar for persons who clutter as for typical speakers.(31)They confirmed findings of previous research that cluttering is associated with typical disfluencies rather than stuttering-type  disfluencies (atypical disfluencies). In this study, stuttering-type disfluencies made up only 3% of total disfluencies for the participants who exhibited cluttering. Similarly, stuttering-type disfluencies made up 2% of total disfluencies of typical speakers. This study emphasized that cluttering is a multidimensional disorder that is associated with a combination of speech and language dimensions and cannot be identified from disfluency analysis aloneAlthough many persons who clutter are unaware of the details of their difficulty, they might develop communication anxiety when they have been misunderstood repeatedly.(6)(11,12) The battery contains 1) two speech situation checklists for assessing an individual's emotional reaction to speech disruptions, 2) the Behavior Checklist (BCL) for assessing how an individual copes with disfluencies, and 3) the Communication Attitude Checklist to measure an individual's attitude towards his or her speech.

The updated version was found to have low but acceptable sensitivity and sufficient specificity to detect possible cluttering behavior. It has been suggested that this revised version could be used as a screening tool for cluttering, but that further assessment to verify cluttering should be performed(9)A freeware tool designed to determine the percentage of talking//associations.missouristate.edu/ICA/cluttering_assessment_program.htm (23)A formal instrument for assessing cluttering severity for both Spanish and English speakers.

Additionally, the person need to develop increased self-awareness  in order to monitor speech as therapy progresses(40) \u2013Addressing emotional factors; discussing how cluttering affects the person\u2019s self-esteem,  anxiety levels, and social interactions and increasing awareness of the interplay between cluttering and emotions(40) \u2013Addressing verbal-motor  aspects of cluttering; working to slow the person\u2019s rate of speech with tapping, visual feedback, auditory feedback, or metronome drills. In addition to slowing the rate of speech, it is essential to teach a person who clutters about the importance of appropriate pausing during conversational speech(40) \u2013Addressing communication; identifying and changing any negative pragmatic communication behaviors the person who clutters uses, such as poor listening and turn-taking skills, impulsivity, and verbosity(40)",

An 8-year-old  female in whom cluttering and stuttering were diagnosed was taught in two individual treatment sessions to insert pauses in her speech after short phrase groups of three to six syllables. No information was provided regarding the specifics of instruction or the duration of the treatment sessions. The percentage of stuttered syllables increased in three of the four treatment conditions, and the percentage of the nonstuttered disfluencies increased during half of the treatment sessions and decreased during the other half of the treatment sessions.

The authors concluded that this case showed that added pausing leads to decreased rate of speech but recommended further investigation of this treatment approach(30)",

Problem Goal Intervention Expected Progression Home Program Lack of awareness of speech difficultyIncrease awareness of speech difficultyUse of recordings and visuals to make the individual aware of speech difficulties The SLP might record a speech sample and write out some sentences, indicating when words are rushed or run together. By hearing the sample and seeing a visual representation of his or her speech, the individual might become better aware of pausing and rate differences(3)Hierarchy might be increased awareness of speech in the therapy setting, progressing to better awareness outside of the therapy settingThe individual can keep a logbook or journal indicating times when he or she is misunderstood  Cluttering/fast rate of speechReduce cluttering Slow rate of speech _ The following methods have been suggested for use with individuals who clutter to reduce their rate of speech. A person who clutters has more difficulty reducing rate of speech than an individual who does not clutter;(3) the SLP might have to try different strategies to find an effective method:",
            "Delayed auditory feedback (DAF): A DAF device provides an electronically altered speech signal so that the speaker hears his or her voice differently and speaks more slowly. The individual might practice speaking with the DAF device and then without the DAF device to slow speech in different conversational situations(3)",
            "Clinicians can signal the individual during conversation when the rate of speech increases. For younger children, the SLP can give \"speeding tickets\" when the child rushes or omits spaces between. The SLP might use a toy or hand- made speedometer to manipulate as the individual's speech rate changes(3)",
            "The individual might practice slowing speech by matching the rate to a prerecorded sentence model(3)Hierarchy might include reducing speech rate in different environments (e.g., clinical setting, over the phone, during presentations). The individual might also progress from responding to cues by the therapist to self- cueingThe individual will practice a slowed rate of speech at home  Cluttering/fast rate of speechIncrease ability to monitor speechPractice in self- monitoring",
            "The individual might practice identifying moments of his or her own increased rate of speech by listening to audiotape or watching videotapes of recorded conversations",
            "The individual and SLP can produce examples of the individual's best and worst speech and the individual might adopt a practice of listening to the tape to enhance monitoring and remember to slow rate(3)The individual will become more aware of rate increases in his or her own speechThe individual might do self-monitoring activities at home Cluttering/poor articulationUse clear articulation Practice in clear articulation",
            "The SLP might address any speech errors (e.g., cluster reduction) that are contributing to lack of intelligibility",
            "The individual might practice short sentences and multisyllabic words to achieve clear, uncluttered speech(3)The individual might practice specific sounds, sound blends, or multisyllabic words in increasingly longer contexts (e.g., words, phrases, sentences)The individual should practice articulation at home  Cluttering/unorganized languageIncrease awareness and use of acceptable, organized languagePractice identifying and using clear language _ The SLP can transcribe the individual's mazes (tangential conversation), run- ons, or cluttered utterances so that the individual has a visual representation and can become aware of essential and nonessential information. Phrases or sentences can be repeated to make them more clear(3)The individual might practice \"clear\" language in progressively more difficult tasks such as picture descriptions, narratives, explanations, or giving directionsThe individual should have a home program to practice clear and organized language Cluttering/poor pragmatic skillsIncrease pragmatic (discourse) skillsSocial language training",
            "The SLP can assist the individual in using pragmatic skills such as appropriate eye gaze, turn-taking, listening to the conversational partner, checking in with the conversational partner (\"Did you get that?\"), and identifying the conversational partner's level of interest in the topic(3)",
            "The SLP can assist in the individual in better recognizing signs that the listener doesn\u2019t understand (e.g., confused look, furrowed brow)",
            "Instruction on the use of appropriate pausing and use of silence during conversations might be beneficial. Cluttering often is associated with excessive talking(22)Discourse skills might be taught in individual sessions and then practiced in group sessionsWhen possible, discourse skills should be practiced and monitored at home for generalization  Cluttering/unnatural rhythm and prosody of speechIncrease naturalness of rate and rhythm of speechInstruction in varying syllable durations and intonation contours (3)",
            "Instruct the individual to use more natural speech patterns by using feedback methods such as a Visi-Pitch",
            "During practice of multisyllabic words, stressed syllables might be exaggerated so that unstressed syllables are not omitted(21)",
            "Have the individual practice using different types of intonation (e.g., asking questions vs. making statements). Use contrastive drills to practice patterns (\"Tell Me or Ask Me game\")(22)The individual will increase the naturalness of his/her speech. Progression will depend on the individual's level and might begin with single words and phrases and progress to conversation/story- tellingN/A Cluttering and stutteringReduce speech disfluenciesStuttering therapy",
            "If the individual shows stuttering- like disfluencies in addition to cluttering, target stuttering in therapy, preferably after components of cluttering have been addressed.(3) Techniques used in the stuttering therapy, such as easy onset of voice, prolonged syllables, and correct breathing, can also assist with management of cluttering symptoms.
