Results showed that continuous wearing of a compression garment during the inflammatory phase of DOMS helped reduce muscle stiffness, but had no significant effect on muscle perfusion or CK levels (50) \u2013Authors of a 2013 meta-analysis  of 12 studies found that wearing a compression sleeve garment during or after exercise-induced  DOMS had a moderate effect on enhancing recovery by reducing pain intensity, CK levels, and the loss of muscle strength and power(29) \u2013Authors of a 2015 systematic review of 23 RCTs found moderate evidence that wearing a compression garment after exercise-induced  DOMS aids in performance recovery and reducing muscle pain. However, the benefit was not related to the amount of pressure applied(45)  . Problem Goal Intervention Expected Progression Home Program  Pain, tenderness, and reduced ROMResolve pain and tenderness thereby improving ROMTherapeutic exercises _ Light to moderate concentric exercise (e.g., cycling) may provide temporary analgesia during a treatment session, but it does not appear to have a lasting effect.(18,19)Warm- up may reduce the intensity of soreness immediately after the causative exercise.(20)Application of a foam roller to affected muscles may help to reduce muscle soreness and to improve ROM(35) _ _ Manual therapy _ The consensus is that ice massage and manual stretching are not effective for improving signs and symptoms of DOMS(13,46) _ Gentle massage may provide more benefit than rest(30) _ _ Modalities Microcurrent,(21) high- volt pulsed current,(22) pulsed ultrasound,(23) continuous ultrasound,(24) and static magnetic fields(25) have each been found ineffective. Interferential current applied at 24 hours after exercise may provide an analgesic benefit(34)Therapeutic exercises Progress to antagonist muscle contraction to improve joint ROM and maintain flexibility (e.g., if quadriceps muscle has DOMS, perform a hamstring curl in the pain-free ROM for quads)Provide strategies for home that will not exacerbate DOMS (e.g., stretching or continuing the causative exercise)  Reduced strength Normalize strength Therapeutic exercise _ Gentle concentric exercise may be initiated as patient tolerance allows. Further research is warranted to determine if light exercise normalizes muscle function sooner than simple rest(13)Given the lack of evidence to support or make recommendations around the progression of the individual with DOMS, therapists are advised to use their clinical judgmentProvide recommendations for home that address reduced strength as indicated Reduced flexibility Normalize flexibility Therapeutic exercise _ Gentle concentric exercise may be initiated as patient tolerance allows. Further research is warranted to determine if light exercise and/ or gentle stretching normalizes muscle function sooner than simple rest(14)Given the lack of evidence to support or make recommendations around the progression of the individual with DOMS, therapists are advised to use their clinical judgmentProvide recommendations for home that address reduced flexibility as indicated Impaired functional mobilityNormalize function in general activitiesPhysical agents and mechanical modalities _ Wearing a compression sleeve during or after exercise-induced DOMS may reduce pain and promote faster recovery of functional mobility(28,29,45)Functional training _ Return to active training should be postponed until normal sport-specific function can be demonstrated without any painProvide recommendations for home that address reduced function as indicated ."
