Behaviors at mealtimes can resemble behavioral noncompliance but are more likely to be related to ASDFood preferences are typically based upon texture, smell, appearance, and flavor; however, fear and anxiety may also result in avoidance of certain types of food.(3) For example, neophobia, or the fear of any new experience or thing, can result in fear of unknown foods and is common in individuals with ASD.(8) Selective eating can result in poor nutrition and underweight(8)Sensory processing issues can lead to restrictive food preferences (e.g., refusal to eat foods with specific tastes, smells, textures, or colors) as well as a higher sensitivity to the feeding  environment. For example, a school cafeteria setting with fluorescent lights, elevated noise levels, and a variety of smells can overwhelm and agitate a child with ASD, who might be unable to filter out these environmental distractions.(3,11,33) For detailed information about sensory processing disorder, see Clinical Review\u2026SensoryPediatrics ; Topic ID NumberIt is unclear whether there is a higher prevalence of GI issues such as GERD, constipation, diarrhea, and food allergies in children with ASD.(3) Factors associated with ASD such as communication problems may exacerbate the effects of GI issues, resulting in behavior-based  or nonverbal refusal of foods that may potentially cause discomfort(3)Repetitive and ritualistic behaviors are diagnostic features of ASD and may include insistence on specific methods of food preparation, food types, and specific mealtime rules.(3) In addition, executive function difficulties such as impaired planning might result in an individual insisting on eating the same food at each meal to better control and anticipate the mealtime experience(3)Difficulty in self-monitoring  may cause the patient to believe that a meal is finished prematurely. Some individuals with ASD have been noted to disregard internal cues of hunger and rely more on external stimuli such as the time or presence food.(3) Overeating or under-eating  may also be influenced by medications(8)Comprehension issues and communication difficulties can lead to misunderstandings and fear about situations involving food and the food itself. For example, if parents insist on the child engaging in conversation during a meal, the child can develop negative associations with eating associated with these social demands.(3) Communication issues might also prevent the child from indicating food preferences, satiation, hunger, or discomfort associated with eating(10)Disruptive behaviors that interfere with eating may include crying, screaming, aggressive behavior, or self-injurious  behavior(10)Rumination refers to the repetitive regurgitation of recently ingested food into the mouth and has been reported in individuals with intellectual disabilities and ASD. One side effect of rumination is the erosion of the teeth by gastric acid(8)Pica is the eating of inedible, nonfood substances and has been reported in individuals with ASD(8,11,33)Polydipsia refers to dangerous water intoxication and is rare but has been reported in a few individuals with ASD and intellectual disabilities(8)",

The SLP\u2019s role is to identify any communication issues regarding feeding/eating and to ensure that the patient is not at risk for dysphagia. When qualified, the SLP may also assess behaviors associated with eating (e.g., functional behavior analysis). Assessment of consistency in feeding can be determined by an interview with the family and multiple mealtime observations. Observations should occur in different settings (e.g., home, cafeteria) and across different meal types (e.g., breakfast, lunch). The SLP may observe feeding in response to different textures and flavor changes as well as other mealtime variables (e.g., type of utensils, noise in the environment).(3) Some examples of standardized measures to assessA caregiver-rated  measure of eating and mealtime problems.

        "treatment summary": [
            "Behavioral treatment techniques: Behavioral treatment has been used to address a variety of eating difficulties associated with ASD, including food selectivity and food refusal, lack of compliance, insufficient food consumption, rapid eating, and food packing (packing mouth with food instead of swallowing/pocketing food).(1,34) Behavioral treatment has shown promise with individuals with ASD in case studies and single subject design studies. The following are some examples of behavioral treatment in studies with individuals with feeding disorders: \u2013High-probability  tasks interspersed with low-probability tasks (behavioral momentum): In a high-probability (high-p) instructional sequence, an instruction with low probability of compliance (low-p)  is preceded by an instruction with a high probability of compliance (high-p).  The purpose of the use of this sequence is to increase the occurrence of low-p tasks. The effect of a high-p  instructional sequence on food acceptance and inappropriate behavior of 3 children (ages 2 years, 2 years, and 6 years) was examined in a single subject (reversal design) study in the United States.(22) All 3 children demonstrated some type of food refusal, but none was diagnosed with ASD. Each child was presented with a high-p  task (accepting a nuk brush without food) prior to the presentation of a low-p task (accepting a nuk brush with food). The high-p  sequence consistently increased the acceptance of food by all 3 children. Other studies on high-p sequence have shown contrasting findings with transient or no increases in food acceptance(23,24) \u2013Prompting: Children with ASD have been reported to eat too rapidly, risking choking and hindering adequate digestion. In a United States single subject (reversal design) study, 3 teenagers with ASD who were observed to eat too quickly were taught to take a bite of food only when a pager vibrated at predetermined intervals during meals at school.(25) The vibrating pager increased the total duration of meals and slowed the consumption rate of all 3 teenagers \u2013Fading: The object of a fading procedure is to introduce a previously avoided stimulus in such a way that negative behaviors are not provoked. The stimulus is introduced with a preferred stimulus, and the preferred stimulus is gradually faded as the nonpreferred stimulus is accepted. Children with ASD are often reported to have a limited diet with unhealthy foods.(11) In order to introduce new foods into the individual\u2019s diet, the therapist must proceed slowly.(11) In a case study of a 4-year-old girl with ASD, the objective was to increase the quantity of milk accepted during mealtimes.(26) The subject would not accept any more than a mixture of 50% milk with 50% PediaSure (a supplemental nutritional beverage). During the treatment protocol (30 sessions during meals), the proportion of milk was gradually increased by 6.25% (one tablespoon) across successive sessions. After the treatment sessions (data probe, session 37), the child drank 100% milk \u2013Differential reinforcement of alternative behavior, escape extinction, and demand fading: Reinforcement for eating increasing quantities of previously nonpreferred food has been employed in several studies of children with ASD and feeding disorders.(1) Differential reinforcement refers to positive reinforcement of the desired behavior (e.g., eating a variety of foods) coupled with removal of reinforcement for the undesired behavior (e.g., eating only select foods). Escape extinction refers to the elimination of escape behavior (demand avoidance). One example of an escape behavior would be crying or vomiting when presented with a nonpreferred food item. A multiple baseline across settings design evaluated the effects of differential reinforcement of alternative behavior (DRA), escape extinction, and demand feeding on increasing the variety of accepted food for a 4-year-old  boy with ASD who had a selective diet of candy, chips, and chicken nuggets.(27) DRA treatment sessions were conducted at home by his mother. Initial sessions were terminated when the child accepted a bite of nonpreferred food (e.g., broccoli, cheese, cooked chicken) or when 30 minutes had elapsed. He was allowed to have a plate with four preferred foods when he accepted one bite of nonpreferred food. Bites expelled or vomited resulted in new presentations of the nonpreferred food. When the subject swallowed the required number of bites for three consecutive dinners, the number of bites of nonpreferred foods required for reinforcement was increased. Gradually, the number of bites of the nonpreferred foods increased as the number of bites of the preferred food decreased  \u2013Simultaneous presentation and sequential presentation of foods: Several studies have examined the effectiveness of simultaneous and sequential food presentation in introducing new, previously nonpreferred foods to children with ASD who are selective eaters.(1,28) In a study in the United States of 3 children with ASD, researchers explored the effects of simultaneous vs. sequential presentation of nonpreferred foods.(29) In the simultaneous condition, nonpreferred foods were embedded in preferred foods (e.g., broccoli embedded in an apple), whereas sequential presentation involved following a nonpreferred food with a preferred food. One of the subjects was a 10-year-old  boy with ASD who only ate crunchy foods. The subject made faster initial gains with the simultaneous condition but eventually ate 100% of nonpreferred foods in both conditions \u2013Multicomponent behavioral treatment: In a case study with two 4-year-old  children with ASD, researchers successfully reduced food packing in both children using a multicomponent behavior treatment plan. For each child, a different combination of behavioral techniques was combined to successfully reduce food packing.(34) The following techniques were utilized: -Re-distribution:  removing packed food from the child\u2019s mouth and placing it on the child\u2019s tongue(34) -Nonremoval of the spoon: keeping the spoon in the child\u2019s mouth to prevent packing(34) -Swallow facilitation: stimulating the tongue with a flipped spoon or nuk brush to facilitate swallowing(34) -Chaser treatments: following solid boluses with a liquid wash (or a solid bolus with high rates of acceptance) to reduce packing in the oral cavity(34)",
            "Sensory-based  techniques: Sensory-based  strategies are often recommended by an OT or SLP to address certain behavioral responses (e.g., decreasing self-stimulatory  behavior, improving attention, regulating activity). Specific strategies may include a variety of oral and facial massage techniques as well as introduction of different tastes, temperatures, and textures of food and use of equipment such as straws and chewy tubes. Generalizations regarding the use of sensory-based strategies with children with ASD and feeding difficulties cannot be made due to the absence of empirical evidence.(3) Clinical judgment should be used when implementing sensory-based  techniques, and collaboration with an OT might be indicated.

Replace maladaptive routines with new ones by involving the child in selecting food from a set of choices, teaching the child to select a type of food from each food group, and establishing rules that govern food choices (e.g., the same food can only be eaten every other day). For impulsive eating behaviors, teach explicit eating sequences to help the child develop safer eating patterns (e.g., \u201cTake a small bite, chew, swallow; take a small bite, chew, swallow)(3)Progression of therapy tasks will vary according to patient goalsNew routines should be used at home/school  Oral hyposensitivity or oral hypersensitivity to certain foodsMinimize the effect of sensory processing on maladaptive mealtime behaviors and food preferencesSensory strategies _ Specific strategies may include a variety of oral and facial massage techniques as well as introduction of different tastes, temperatures, and textures of food and use of equipment such as straws and chewy tubes. For example, to introduce a nonpreferred food item, the therapist may change the texture of the food to make it more acceptable (e.g., change apples into applesauce or apple puree). Collaborate with an OT as necessary.(3) Generalizations regarding the use of sensory-based strategies with children with ASD and feeding difficulties cannot be made due to the absence of empirical evidence(3)Progression of therapy tasks will vary according to patient goalsSensory strategies should be used at home and school  Maladaptive behaviors and stress during mealtimesDecrease stress and inappropriate behaviors during mealtimesEnvironmental modifications _ Provide an environmentally friendly place and predictable routines during mealtime:(3)",
