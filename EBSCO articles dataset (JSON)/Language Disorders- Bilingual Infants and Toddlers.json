            "Signs and symptoms of a language disorder will vary greatly depending upon the cause of the language disorder, the age of the child, the language demands placed upon the child, and the child\u2019s environment. The symptoms of language disorders might be mild or severe and vary between children as well as in the course of a single child\u2019s lifetime. Infants and toddlers with language disorders might display delayed language acquisition, limited vocabulary use, limited comprehension of language, delayed phonological skills, short utterance length, poor pragmatic skills, and/ or delayed use of grammatical structures.(2,3,4) Bilingual infants and toddlers are likely to display the same symptoms of language disorder as monolingual speakers of the same language. For example, the same types of grammatical errors are likely to be seen in the English language of a monolingual English-speaking  child with a language disorder and a bilingual English-  and Spanish-speaking  child with a language disorder(3) Causes, Pathogenesis, & Risk Factors"

            "Precautions regarding the assessment of bilingual children \u2013SLPs who assess bilingual children should be knowledgeable of the stages involved in the normal acquisition of a second language, including ways in which learning a second language (L2) can affect the child\u2019s use of his or her first language (L1). SLPs must be aware that young children who are learning a second language might display decreasing skills in L1 even in the absence of a language disorder. Diminishing fluency in L1 is more likely to occur in children who do not receive continued support in developing that language(2,8,9) \u2013While children are in the process of learning L2, their language skills and classroom performance might be impacted by numerous affective, sociocultural, and linguistic factors (e.g., is the child motivated to learn L2? How much exposure does the child have to native L2 speakers? Does the child\u2019s family value the use of L2? What is the family\u2019s socioeconomic status and how might this affect the child\u2019s language skills?)(8) \u2013When assessing a bilingual child suspected of having a language disorder, it is critical to assess the child\u2019s collective language system (i.e., combined skills of L1 and L2) rather than his or her skills in each language separately(2) \u2013Distinguishing a language difference from a language disorder is complicated by the fact that there is very little information on typical development in languages other than English and that much variety exists among speakers of other languages (e.g., Spanish speakers from Mexico might use different vocabulary than Spanish speakers from Spain or Central America).(8) Additionally, it is important to determine whether errors in a child\u2019s speech are related to limited proficiency in a second language or an actual language disorder. Errors made by typically developing bilingual children differ from errors made by bilingual children with language impairment. For a typically developing bilingual child, vocabulary substitution errors are common and often influenced by knowledge of the child\u2019s first language; however, errors that violate syntactic principles of the language (e.g., omission of morphemes) are characteristic of a language disorder(19) \u2013When the SLP conducting a language assessment on a bilingual child does not speak the same language(s) as the child, collaboration with trained support personnel is recommended. Professional interpreters or translators, bilingual diagnosticians, bilingual speech-language  pathology assistants, trained speakers from the child\u2019s L1 community, and/or family members can fill this role(20) \u2013Published research indicates that: 1) two separate phonological systems develop in bilingual children and 2) the stages of phonological development in typically developing bilingual children are different from the stages of phonological development in typically developing monolingual children who speak one of the same languages.(21) For example, a typically developing bilingual, English-  and Urdu-speaking  child will display phonological development in English that differs from the phonological development of a typically developing monolingual, English-speaking  child. Therefore, developmental information normed on monolingual children cannot be used to identify a phonological disorder in bilingual children \u2013SLI appears to manifest similarly in monolingual children and children with approximately equal abilities in two languages.(25) There is evidence to suggest that bilingualism does not exacerbate language disorders in children; however, it might lead to slower development of vocabulary (in children with and without language impairment). In a study conducted in Finland with 73 Swedish-Finnish  bilingual children and 43 Swedish-speaking  monolingual children, researchers found that the children in the study population who were identified as having SLI had lower scores than the control (typically developing) group on all language tests. The bilingual children (with and without language impairment) had lower scores than the monolingual group (with and without language impairment) only on a test of body part naming. The interaction of the group (i.e., control versus SLI) and bilingualism was not significant on any of the language  scores (i.e., bilingualism did NOT exacerbate a language disorder).(22) In a study conducted in Germany with children aged 16 to 26 months, researchers found that the bilingual children had smaller vocabulary sizes in both languages and recommended that the criteria used to diagnose a toddler as a \u201clate talker\u201d for a monolingual child (i.e., less than 50 words and no word combinations at 24 months) should not be used for a bilingual toddler(23)",
            "Precautions regarding the assessment of infants and toddlers \u2013When assessing the language skills of infants and toddlers, it is imperative to use developmentally appropriate contexts, content, and procedures. This can include observation of the child in his or her natural environment during typical or daily activities(10) \u2013When assessing young children, it is essential to collaborate extensively with the child\u2019s family and/or caregivers(10) \u2013The family system and cultural context must be considered when assessing the language skills of young children(4)",
            "Precautions regarding standardized testing of bilingual infants and toddlers \u2013For clinicians in the United States, the use of conventional, norm-referenced tests are culturally inappropriate to use with children from nonmainstream American culture and do not adequately capture a young child\u2019s strengths and weaknesses in the area of communication.(8,10) When assessing infants and toddlers with suspected language disorders, it is critical to use methods such as observation across multiple natural settings and to consider input from parent/caregiver report of a child\u2019s abilities(10) -Developmentally referenced assessment measures compare a child\u2019s skills to those of typically developing children; however, the reference points used by such measures are often based upon skill acquisition by mainstream White children who are monolingual English speakers and might be invalid for children from other cultural and linguistic backgrounds(11) -English tests that have been translated into a child\u2019s L1 are unreliable for many reasons and should not be used to diagnose language disorders(8) \u2013Criterion-  or curriculum-referenced  assessments provide quantitative information (such as what knowledge a child does or does not possess) and provide quantitative test results. These tests might be culturally and linguistically inappropriate and fail to provide information on the child\u2019s thought processes and the strategies he or she used to answer test questions(11) \u2013When assessing a bilingual child, the SLP must ensure that the content of assessment materials and the method of assessment are culturally appropriate.(10) For example, items included in a traditional vocabulary test might not be present in a child\u2019s home culture and/or a child might come from a culture in which adults and children do not engage in one-on-one  interactions",
            "Phases of sequential bilingual development \u2013Normal language acquisition in a child who is exposed to two (or more) languages is different than language acquisition of a monolingual child(7) \u2013The following five phases of bilingual language acquisition should be considered during an evaluation of a bilingual child with a suspected language disorder(7) -Silent period: the period of time in which a child comprehends both languages but has limited expressive output; can last from 3 to 6 months(7) -Language loss: occurs as the child acquires L2; he or she uses L1 less frequently and appears to lose some of his or her skills in L1(7) -Language transfer: a phase in which the child uses syntax, morphology, pragmatics, and/or semantics from L1 when speaking L2(7) -Interlanguage: occurs as the child continues to learn L2 and begins communicate more in both languages; inconsistent error patterns emerge in L2 as part of the normal development of learning a second language(7) -Codeswitching: alternating between two languages within a single conversation or sentence; the child often substitutes structures, forms, or vocabulary from L1 for those in L2 he or she has not yet learned(7)"

This process might involve interviewing the child\u2019s parents, the child,  the child\u2019s teachers, and members of the child\u2019s home culture. The clinician should aim to gather information on 1) the parents\u2019 language goals for the child 2) how parents perceive the child\u2019s language skills to be in comparison to his or her siblings, 3) whether or not there is a history of language disorders within the family, and 4) descriptions of behavior/ language typically exhibited by the child(2,11)Used to gather information about a child\u2019s current use of language as well as his or her futurewhat are the child\u2019s communication environments? Who are the child\u2019s language partners? What purposes will each language serve in the child\u2019s daily life?(2,4)Samples of the child\u2019s expressive language skills in L1 and L2 might be collected during conversations between the child and a peer, sibling, parent, or language-matched  professional/paraprofessional. Language samples of English provide information on the child\u2019s mean length of utterance (MLU), lexical diversity, and pragmatic functions. Although developmental data exist for English language skills, such normative data might not exist for the child\u2019s L1. Additionally, for languages other than English and Spanish, no guidelines exist regarding the collection and analysis of language samples.(2) As a nonstandardized option, adult speakers of the child\u2019s L1 could listen to the language sample and objective judgments on the appropriateness of the child\u2019s language(8)",
            "speech and language examination": " Speech and language examinationPrior to becoming fluent in verbal language, typically developing children use gestures to communicate a variety of thoughts, wants, and needs. Observing a child\u2019s use of gesture can provide information on his or her ability to regulate social interactions, display signs of affection, and request activities or objects.(4) When assessing a child from a different cultural or linguistic background, the SLP must be aware of typical ways in which gesture is used in the child\u2019s familyIn order to assess a young child\u2019s articulation, a speech sample can be taken and analyzed. From this speech sample analysis, information on the child\u2019s phonetic inventory and speech production patterns can be -It is appropriate to conduct testing in L1 only if the child\u2019s exposure to L2 is negligible(14) -When the child has had consistent exposure to two languages, articulation testing should occur in both languages(14) -The SLP must consider the ways each language might affect articulation/phonology in the other language(14)  -If the child does not display an articulation impairment in L1, he or she should not be diagnosed with an articulation impairment, even if errors occur in L2(14) -Dialectical variations of speech production should not be considered errors(14) \u2013Language comprehension and expression -Ideally, language assessments should be conducted in L1 and L2; however, in many situations this is not possible due to a variety of reasons (e.g., lack of trained professionals who speak child\u2019s home language, lack of developmental information on child\u2019s L1). Additionally, language assessments that consider L1 and L2 separately might underestimate the child\u2019s true language abilities(2,15) -Due to the caveats associated with using standardized tests with bilingual infants and toddlers, language assessment will often rely primarily on informal procedures such as observations, interview, and language sampling(8) -If possible, use standardized assessments that were created in a specific language and normed on individuals who speak that language(16) -For example, Inventarios de Desarrollo de Habilidades Communicativas (INV) is a Spanish version of the MacArthur-Bates  Communicative Development Inventories (CDI), not just a translation of the original English version of the test. Additionally, this test was standardized on Spanish-speaking  children/parents in Mexico(16)Wordless books can be used to assess a child\u2019s production of a narrative. Bilingual children are likely to have problems with respect to producing the microstructure (details, complexity) and macrostructure (beginning, middle, end) elements of narratives(24) -Language assessments of bilingual children might focus on functional communication and the child\u2019s ability to effectively communicate his or her thoughts, wants, and needs in daily interactions(8)Pragmatics includes 1) the social use of language and 2) the often implicit rules that dictate the waysintentions (why a child communicates), conversational discourse (turn-taking,  topic changing rules), and role taking (the ability to take the listener\u2019s perspective during conversation. Strong pragmatic skills are essential to being able to engage socially and linguistically, while weak pragmatic skills might indicate the risk of or presence of a language disorder.(4) What are considered appropriate pragmatic skills vary significantly between cultural groups, and the SLP must be knowledgeable of typical pragmatics inAre children expected to initiate conversation with adults? Are children \u201callowed\u201d to direct topics of conversation? Are young children\u2019s verbalizations and actions considered intentional?(13)Rule out or identify the presence of a voice disorder by listening to the child\u2019s vocal quality in a language sample -For detailed information on voice disorders, see the series of the Clinical Reviews on this topicRule out or identify atypical speech disfluencies (stuttering)",

The quality and quantity of studies investigating the efficacy of language interventions for bilingual children with language impairment is low and most of the studies involve only Spanish-English bilingual children. The research indicates some evidence that bilingual therapy (speech and language treatment in both languages) and in-home  therapy programs are effective. Additional research is necessary to determine the best course of treatment for bilingual children who have or are at risk for a language disorder(26)",
            "Language intervention can either occur in the child\u2019s L1 in order to support his or her conceptual and linguistic development and to ensure continued development in L1or simultaneously in both (all) of the child\u2019s languages.(8,15,17,18) Published research supports the use of L1 in the treatment of bilingual children and indicates that focusing on developing skills in the home language does not negatively impact their acquisition of L2(15,17)",
            "Although supporting the child\u2019s home language should be the first priority of early intervention services, bilingual children with language disorders are likely to need bilingual intervention in order to support the development of L2 as they reach school-age.(17) Linguistic features of L2 that are not present in L1 might require more focused attention (e.g., verb endings which are used to indicate tense are present in English but not Mandarin Chinese)(15)",
            "SLPs should be aware that mixing languages (code-switching)  is common in many families and has social, cultural, and linguistic value. Therefore, code-switching should not be discouraged, nor should parents/family members be encouraged to keep languages separate(15,17)",
            "Research supports the effectiveness of training parents and/or paraprofessionals who speak the child\u2019s L1 to provide intervention services; however, when implementing parent training programs, the SLP must be aware of cultural differences in communication styles(13,17)",
            "Research demonstrates that using typically developing peer models can facilitate language development in children with language disorders or delay. Therefore, matching 2 children with the same L1 (one typically developing, one with a language disorder) might serve to improve the language skills of the child with language disorder(17)",
