            "Since the publication of this systematic review there have been additional studies evaluating cognitive rehabilitation treatments in patients following stroke \u2013Authors of an RCT (N = 36) compared two personalized and adaptive cognitive rehabilitation approaches in patients following stroke. They compared paper-and-pencil  tasks to virtual-reality-based  intervention tools and their impact on the different domains measured by the MoCA. Both tools personalized and adapted treatments(45) -Pencil-and-paper  intervention group:Interventions generated were delivered to the patient on paper. The patient was instructed to use the arm he or she felt most comfortable with  -Virtual-reality-based  intervention group: Interventions were similar to the paper-and-pencil  tasks but weresituated in various virtual locations similar to those in the real world (e.g., streets, sidewalks, buildings, shops, parks) -The intervention time was 1 month (12 sessions), with data collected pre-treatment,  post-treatment,  and at a 2-month follow-up -The virtual-reality-based  intervention compared to the pencil-and-paper intervention was superior in general cognitive functioning, visuospatial ability, and executive functions on the MoCA \u2013Authors of an RCT (N = 48) evaluated the effect of Baduanjin exercise on cognitive function in patients with post-stroke cognitive impairment(47) -Baduanjin intervention group: Baduanjin is a mind-body  exercise that uses 8 different movements requiring coordination of the body, breathing, and mind. It requires sustained attention, focus, and multitasking -Patients were assigned to the Baduanjin group or to a control group treated with medication and traditional rehabilitation. Baduanjin group recevieved training 3x/week for 40 minutes a day for 24 weeks -MoCA score improvements for the Baduanjin group were significantly greater than the control group at 16 weeks of intervention, 24 weeks, and 28 weeks -Baduanjin training in patients following stroke with cognitive impairments can improve global cognitive function, memory, motor execution, attention, and ADLs \u2013Authors of an RCT (N = 30) evaluated the effects of cognitive-motor  dual-task training combined with auditory motor synchronization training on cognitive functioning in patients following stroke. Patients received either cognitive-motor dual-task  training only (control group) or cognitive-motor dual-task  training with auditory motor synchronization training (experimental group)(50) -Control group:Received cognitive-motor  dual-task  training 3x/week for 30-minute  sessions for 6 weeks. This training consisted of motor tasks associated with balance and posture while simultaneously performing a cognitive task associated with attention, memory, and executive function (e.g., while performing trunk rotations the patient must name the days of the week in reverse order) -Experimental group: Received the same cognitive-motor  dual-task  training 3x/week for 15minutes of eachsession for 6 weeks as the control group. The remaining 15 minutes of each session involvedauditory motor synchronization training. This training consisted of 13 differentmotor tasksperformed while pressing the hand or foot trigger of a metronome at appropriate times (e.g., the two-hand  task involved tapping both hands rhythmically while making a semicircular movement to match the reference sound) -Results indicated that cognitive-motor  dual-task  training combined with auditory motor synchronization was more effective than the cognitive-motor dual-task  training alone in improving cognition",
            "In general, occupational therapy for stroke focuses on two guiding principles: intrinsic recovery and adaptive recovery.(13) Intrinsic recovery involves restoration of function of damaged neural pathways through local changes of blood flow, metabolism, and/or neurotransmitter concentrations.(13) As the degree of intrinsic recovery will be different for each patient and generally is dictated by severity of stroke, adaptive recovery complements intrinsic recovery.(13) Adaptive recovery involves educating patients in compensatory techniques to increase overall independence and reduce the level of disability created by physical impairments(13) \u2013Examples of intrinsic recovery for patients with cognitive impairment include increased sustained attention to tasks, improved problem-solving  skills with ADLs, and faster speed of processing with functional tasks(3) \u2013Examples of adaptive techniques for patients with cognitive impairment include use of a journal to recall the events of the day, modifying the environment, utilizing pictures as a reminder for following safety precautions, and having alarms to remind the patient to take his or her medications properly(3)",
            "In addition to identifying the patient\u2019s cognitive impairments, it is also the role of the OT to educate both the patient and family members on the nature of the patient\u2019s specific impairments and help them understand how the patient best processes information(6)",
            "It is the responsibility of the OT to develop person-centered  goals for patients following stroke. This can be more difficult in patients with cognitive impairments, but it is still extremely important for the OT to involve the patient in the process. Authors of a qualitative study interviewed rehabilitation specialists to gain more perspective on effective strategies(46) \u2013Five themes emerged in the goal-setting  process: flexibility, building trusting relationships, enabling empowerment, techniques for one-to-one  interaction, and involving relatives ",

The authors could not determine whether this affected these patients\u2019 outcomes, but noted that patients with a prior diagnosis of cognitive impairments face barriers in access to stroke rehabilitation(44) \u2013MoCA scores can predict functional gain in patients following stroke treated in inpatient rehabilitation. Authors of a study defined 3 subgroups of scores: normal (score of 25\u201330),  mildly impaired (score of 20\u201324),  and moderately impaired (score less than 19).The FIM score assessed functional gain. Mean relative functional gain (mRFG) quantified the amount of functional gain achieved as a percentage of the total functional gain possible and mean relative functional efficiency (mRFE)which adjusts for length of stay on the FIM total(51) -Patients in the normal range had greater mRFG and MRFE than the mildy impaired group. The moderately impaired group had significantly worse mRFG and MRFE than the mildly impaired group -The moderately impaired group had the least functional gain and the least efficient gains, and a smaller proportion of individuals in this group had a clinically meaningful FIM gain -The authors recommended that patients with a MoCA score below 20 receive additional cognitive remediation interventions, intensive practice, and/or modification and tailoring of treatment strategies to mitigate the risk of poorer functional gains",

Interventions for the following impairments were included: general cognitive deficits, executive dysfunction, apraxia, memory loss, attention deficits, visual field deficits, and unilateral neglect -Evidence supports the use of general cognitive rehabilitation to improve global cognitive function, as well as visuospatial training, post stroke -Evidence to support an individualized home rehabilitation program to improve global cognitive function is insufficient -Limited evidence supports the use of time pressure management for improvement of daily task performance -Evidence to support use of virtual technology to remediate multitasking deficits or exercise and recreation programming to improve executive functioning and memory is limited -Evidence exists for the effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation in improving ADLs in persons with apraxia after stroke -Evidence related to improving ADLs for persons with memory loss after stroke is limited -There is insufficient evidence to support attention process training as an effective treatment for attention deficits after stroke -There is evidence that a variety of interventions are effective in improving occupational performance in patients with unilateral neglect after stroke -Interventions include prisms, visual scanning training, mirror therapy, right half-field  eye-patching,  spatial cueing, and family participation \u2013In a study conducted in Kuwait involving 18 survivors of stroke, subject-performed  tasks (SPTs) and experimenter-performed  tasks (EPTs) were compared to verbal-only  directions to determine which method was better for physical and occupational therapy treatment(25) -SPT: method of teaching patient a technique or strategy by having the patient perform the task himself or herself  -EPT: method of teaching patient a technique or strategy by demonstrating the task for the patient while the patient observes -Results indicated that survivors of stroke with memory difficulties learn better when SPT or EPT is utilized rather than having the therapist simply instruct the patient verbally; i.e., patients will learn and recall information better when therapists use a \u201cshow me\u201d technique rather than a \u201ctell me\u201d technique \u2013In a case study conducted in the United States that utilized task-oriented training for ADL impairment with an 83-year-old female patient who had a left-sided  stroke and cognitive impairments related to a history of moderate dementia, researchers reported increased level of independence on all self-care items at discharge(26)",
