            "General information on thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) \u2013TOS is a group of symptoms triggered by compression of thoracic outlet structures.Wilbourn classified TOS into two main types, vascular and neurogenic, based on the structures that are compressed(28) -Vascular TOS is either venous or arterial -Venous: caused by compression of the subclavian vein(about 6\u20137%  of cases) -Arterial: caused by compression of the subclavian artery (about 3\u20134%  of cases) -NeurogenicTOS is caused by compression of the brachial plexus and is either true or disputed (about 90% of cases) -True:True neurogenic TOS israre and involves objective signs of nerve compression, usually of the lower brachial plexus -Disputed:Has a vague presentation \u2013The brachial plexus and subclavian artery leave the cervical area by running between the anterior and middle scalene, under the clavicle, over the 1st rib, and into the axilla and then the proximal upper extremity. The subclavian vein runs between the anterior scalene and the subclavius muscles, then joins up with the brachial plexus and subclavian artery to pass under the clavicle(2) \u2013Compression may take place at any of three points(3) -The interscalene triangle \u2013 most common site -The costoclavicular triangle -The subcoracoid space \u2013Overview of the brachial plexus(4) -The upper segment of the brachial plexus provides motor nerve supply to -shoulder abductors -shoulder external rotators -elbow flexors -The upper segment of the brachial plexus supplies the shoulder and radial portion of the upper extremity with sensation -The lower segment of the brachial plexus provides motor nerve supply to -the forearm -the hand -The lower segment of the brachial plexus supplies the ulnar region of the upper extremity and hand with sensation  \u2013TOS is widely recognized, but a lack of consistent and precise diagnostic criteriahas created controversy. In 2016 the Society of Vascular Surgery published standards for neurogenic TOS in simplistic terms. They defined neurogenic TOS as being present when 3 of the following 4 features are present:(29) -Evidence of pathology occurring at the thoracic outlet (e.g., pain and/or tenderness) -Evidence of compressive brachial plexopathy (e.g., distal neurologic symptoms in the distribution of the brachial plexus) -Absence of an alternative pathology explaining the symptoms -Positive response to a scalene injection test"

            "Surgery is often the first choice in true neurogenic TOS, especially when there are objective signs from EMG and NCV tests show evidence of nerve compression. However, surgical indications for disputed neurogenic TOS are less clear and an extensive trial of PT is recommend before considering surgery, as it can be effective(28)",
            "There are no RCTs assessing the effectiveness of PT. Neurogenic TOS is a complex and varied condition,making standardizing and comparing treatments difficult. Therefore, management must take an individualized approach to address the mechanical factors causing compromise of neurovascular structures(40)",
            "Individualized and exam-driven  PT programs aim to create space between the first rib and clavicle and decrease load of the limb(40)",
            "Authors of study (N = 150) evaluated PT management and surgical treatment in a prospective observational cohort of patients with neurogenic TOS using patient-reported  outcome measures. All patients underwent a PT evaluation and treatment for 4\u20136 weeks \u2013The PT program consisted of scalene and pectoralis muscle stretching and relaxing exercises, with a focus on shoulder girdle and scapular mobility, mechanics, postural improvement, and diaphragmatic breathing, using caution with strengthening, weight training, and resistance bands \u2013PT alone was effective in 31% of the patients who completed the entire PT program. Surgery was offered to those who did not respond to PT. In those patients whom PT failed, surgery was effective in substantially reducing symptoms in about 90% of the patients \u2013The authors concluded that PT can be effective, but when it is insufficient surgery can be effective",
            "General conservative management \u2013Patient education(10,40) -Postural education -Postural awareness to support the shoulder girdle is the long-term  goal, but short-term  goals to control pain can be achieved through external support -Use of a pillow or towel roll to lift the shoulder girdle while resting, driving, or working at a desk -Tape across the scapulae might help the patient to maintain neutral posture and/or support overlengthened, weak muscle -Instruct patient to cease exercises or activities that aggravate symptoms and to inform treating clinician as well as physician when these situations arise(9) \u2013Diaphragmatic breathing exercises(10) -The patient is taught how to breathe with the diaphragm rather than with the accessory muscles, particularly the scalenes \u2013Manual therapy -Common mobilizations that can help reduce symptoms include first rib mobilizations, anteroposterior mobilizations of the second and third ribs, flexion mobilizations of T2-T5,  and lateral lower cervical glides on the nonpainful side(40) -Trigger point therapy, myofascial release, and massage therapy including cross-fiber  friction and muscle stripping techniques in conjunction with gentle passive stretching can assist with alleviating patient\u2019s pain and loss of ROM and improve strength(23) -Based on a United States case study of a 24-year-old  female with neurogenic TOS -Patient received 8 treatment sessions over a 35-day  period  \u2013Cervical traction -Manual cervical tractionmay be beneficial. The best position to perform on a patient is to ensure a neutral ribcage with either a flexed or depressed sternum(40) -Authors of a study (N = 40) found that mechanical cervical traction may improve some symptoms associated with TOS(14) -Control group received hot pack and exercise program as treatment and the treatment group received hot pack, exercise program, and cervicaltraction -Cervical traction -Set at 20 seconds of traction with 10 seconds of rest -Traction force was reportedly 10 to 15 kg, adjusted to tolerance -Completed in supine -Statistically significant improvements for the treatment group not found in the control group were noted in the Roos\u2019 test, Wright\u2019s test, costoclavicular test, and Erb tenderness (pressure applied with thumb over supraclavicular fossa) -The treatment group also had significantly better numbness scores (measured with a Likert scale) \u2013Therapeutic exercise(40,41) -Stretching to help lengthen shortened tissues found on examination (e.g., pectoralis, latissimus, scalenes). It can be challenging, as stretching can reproduce symptoms. A physical therapist manually lengthening them often can be more effective prior to the patient attemptingstretching on his or her own -Neural glides can be helpful but again caution needs to be used as they can increase symptoms -Strengthening scapular muscles may need to begin after symptoms have begun to subside -Stabilization exercises can be performed with a gym ball (e.g., quadruped over the ball, lifting an upper or lower extremity) -Postural reeducation in conjunction with strengthening and stretching program .
