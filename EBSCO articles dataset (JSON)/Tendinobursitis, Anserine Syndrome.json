            "Tendons of the sartorius, gracilis, and semitendinosus muscles have the same insertion. It is 5 to 6 cm distal to the knee along the proximal anteromedial tibia. The three separate tendons come together to form one structure that resembles the shape of a webbed foot. This characteristic has led the conjoint structure to be named pes anserinus, Latin for goosefoot(7,14)",
            "The pes anserine muscles are primarily knee flexors. Secondarily, they are tibial internal rotators that function as dynamic stabilizers to protect the knee from valgus and rotary stressors",

            "Pes anserine tendinopathy is a condition affecting the pes anserine tendon, but it may also involve the bursa. The term pes anserine syndrome may be used when the condition appears inflammatory(5,9)",
            "Pes anserine tendinopathy often coexists with other chronic knee disorders and is therefore usually included in the differential diagnosis of knee pain.(4) Involvement of the pes anserine should be considered when there is spontaneous pain inferomedial to the knee joint, especially in patients with knee osteoarthritis(5)",
            "Tendinopathy is a clinical syndrome describing an overuse tendon injury characterized by pain, swelling, and/or functional limitation. Tendinopathy can be tendinitis (presence of inflammation) or tendinosis (absence of inflammation). However, distinguishing tendinitis from tendinosis is not clinically feasible in most cases. Overuse tendon injury should be considered tendinopathy when not acute(9)",
            "The term pes anserine syndrome is used for patients who may have anserine tendinopathy and/or pes anserine bursitis, which is a more inflammatory condition(5)"
