Symptoms will vary according to the alteration in pulmonary blood flow and may vary depending on the age of the child(4) \u2013Infant/toddler with decreased pulmonary blood flow: cyanosis, loss of consciousness \u2013Older child with decreased pulmonary blood flow: dizziness, syncope \u2013Infant/toddler with increased pulmonary blood flow: tachypnea with activity or feeding, diaphoresis, poor weight gain \u2013Older child with increased pulmonary blood flow: exercise intolerance, dyspnea on exertion, diaphoresis",
            "CHD is typically divided into two categories: cyanotic and acyanotic. They may occur alone or in combination \u2013Cyanotic refers to a group of congenital heart diseases that alter the way blood flows through the heart, resulting in deoxygenated blood being circulated out into the body instead of oxygenated blood. This results in cyanosis (i.e., bluish skin color resulting from lack of oxygen). This classification includes the following:(4) -Tetralogy of Fallot in infants and children -Pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect -Transposition of the great arteries -Tricuspid atresia -Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) -Truncus arteriosus -Eisenmenger syndrome -Total anomalous pulmonary venous return \u2013Acyanotic refers to a group of congenital heart diseases that do not result in cyanosis. This classification includes the following:(4) -Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) -Ventricular septal defect (VSD) -Atrial septal defects (ASDs) \u2013 acyanotic unless right ventricle dysfunction occurs -Atrioventricular septal defect -Coarctation of aorta -Aortic stenosis -Mitral valve prolapse -Diseases of the aorta and coronary artery abnormalities -Ebstein anomaly of the tricuspid valve -Pulmonary valve stenosis \u2013 This condition is typically acyanotic but may become cyanotic in neonates with severe obstruction and impaired left-to-right  blood flow through the ductus",
            "Repaired or unrepaired CHD may lead to residual defects and result in congestive heart failure. Signs and symptoms of heart failure vary and may include the following:(14) \u2013Infants and neonates -Decreased volume of feeding -Tachypnea and diaphoresis during feeding -Easy fatigue, agitation, or irritability -Poor weight gain, failure to thrive -Delayed milestones \u2013Children and adolescents -Easy fatiguability  -GI symptoms \u2013 abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting -Recurrent or chronic cough with wheezing -Anorexia -Chest pain -Edema -Exercise intolerance -Palpitations -Syncope",

It should include static and dynamic activities and always incorporate the patient\u2019s interests to enhance intrinsic motivation(7) \u203aEducate the primary caregivers on the importance of the entire family participating in daily physical activity in order to increase overall patient compliance with short-  and long-term  treatment plan \u203aUse an accelerometer or pedometer to measure physical activity level.

        "It is important that the multidisciplinary pediatric care team emphasize the prevention of risk factors for developing adult cardiovascular disease, specifically obesity, smoking, and hyperlipidemia. Compared to children without CHD, these children are at increased risk for sedentary behaviors which coincide with developing obesity, exercise intolerance, delayed motor skills, and psychosocial impairments. Primary caregivers need to be counseled to avoid overprotection and unnecessary physical and social activity restriction of their child or adolescent with CHD(3,7,10) Assess patient\u2019s habitual physical activity every health visit. Encourage the entire family to participate in daily physical activity in order to increase compliance(7) Sedentary transport, extended sitting, and time indoors should be limited throughout the day. Screen time should be no more than 2 hours per day for children \u2265 5 years of age, and children < 3 years of age should have no screen time(7) Based on published data, there appears to be a negligible risk of physical activity\u2013related  sudden death among most children with CHD \u2013The most common causes of sudden death during sport participation are either not related to CHD (e.g., long-QT syndrome, cardiomyopathy) or are conditions that manifest with sudden death as the first symptom (coronary  artery anomalies that are undiagnosed). Sudden death can occur in patients with repaired CHD (e.g., aortic stenosis); however, these events are rarely associated with physical activity or sport(7,12) The United States Society of Cardiology and the European Society of Cardiology both published guidelines specific to adolescents with CHD who are involved in competitive sports and for all children < 18 years of age with known arrhythmias or genetic cardiovascular disease, primarily long-QT  syndrome, cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, and Marfan syndrome. These guidelines should not be used for preadolescents or for those involved in recreational sport, physical education, or unstructured physical activity at all ages(7) Several European associations collectively published recommendations for physical activity in pediatric patients with CHD based on a nonsystematic review of available research. Their main conclusion: promote rather than restrict physical activity in this patient population(7)",
        "The AHA Science Advisory Committee published guidelines for screening approaches for heart disease in children and adolescents(12) Screening programs should be all-encompassing  and not focused only on athletes There are currently no standardized strategies in the United States for screening the school-age  child and there are limited published studies assessing the benefits of ECGs as screening tools. Therefore, in 2007, the AHA did not endorse mandatory screening with ECG or other noninvasive tests, and this is still the current recommendation for school-age children(12)",
        "Health-related  QOL Adolescents transitioning into adulthood are at risk for poor adjustment in the areas of vocation, social development, and domestic environment and for psychological distress. Overprotective parenting and uncertainties about long-term prognosis may result in missed critical adolescent milestones that emphasize autonomy. Developmental immaturity and poor understanding of their illness may make adolescents with a CHD vulnerable to engaging in risk-taking behaviors such as substance abuse or sexual activity in an effort to feel similar to their peers(3) Travel precautions: Long periods of immobilization in a cramped position during travel by air, bus, or car are associated with an increased leg volume and a moderate effect on the coagulation system. Children with CHD may be at higher risk for thrombosis during these periods. Taking frequent breaks to stand up and walk around or getting up and walking down the aisle may assist with reducing the risk of developing a thrombosis. Patients/primary caregivers should notify the referring physician of any plans for prolonged travel(6)",
