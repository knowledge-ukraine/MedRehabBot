            "Vertebral compression fracture (VCF) is a collapse of the vertebral body due to high-force  trauma or progressive weakening. VCFscompromise the anterior column of the spine, thereby resulting in a wedge deformity with greater loss of height anteriorly than posteriorly(1,2,21)",
            "VCFis considered a common fragility fracture due to the high occurrence in patients with osteoporosis, especially in older women(21) \u2013It is estimated that at least 25% of women \u2265 50 years old have had at least one VCF \u2013It is estimated that 40%\u201350%  of patients over the age of 80 years have had at least one VCF",
            "VCF can occur in younger patientssecondary to high-energy  mechanisms (e.g., fall from a height ormotor vehicle accident [MV A])(21) \u2013In younger patients about 50% of VCFs are due to MV As and 25% to falls",
            "VCF compromises only the anterior column of the spinal column. Two of the three columns must be compromised for the fracture to be considered unstable. Therefore, VCF is considered a stable fracture(21)",
            "VCFs are most common at the thoracolumbar junction (T12\u2013L1)  and the midthoracic region (T6\u2013T8)(22)",
            "VCF produces acute back pain, neurological symptoms, and kyphosis. Progressive loss of functional mobility is associated with reduced health-related  quality of life (HRQOL) and increased mortality(1,2,18)",
            "Conservative medical management for patients with acute osteoporotic VCFs and back pain involves short-term bed  rest, analgesic medication, bracing (spinal orthoses), and physical therapy(19)",
            "Surgical management of VCF includes vertebral augmentation. Two minimally invasive procedures are vertebroplasty (VP) and balloon kyphoplasty (BKP). In both procedures, cement is injected into the affected vertebrae to increasetheir anterior height and strength(23)"

Surgical intervention involves bone cement augmentation of the affected vertebrae by VP or BKP. The goals of both are to reinforce mechanical strength, restore height of the vertebral body, correct/ improve kyphosis, decrease pain, and improve function(22,23) In VP, bone cement is injected into the involved vertebral body to reinforce its mechanical strength and to restore its height BKP is performed by inserting a balloon into the compressed vertebral body and inflating it to restore the normal vertebral height. Cement is then injected into the space created by the balloon. Similar to VP, this increases the height and strength of the vertebral body Both VP and BKP are widely used. Which is used more often depends on local availability and expertise.In the United States, between 2005 and 2010 three out of every four procedures were BKP. However, there is no consensus on whether one type is better than the other and at what point surgical bone augmentation may bemore beneficial than conservative treatment(23) Authors of a systematic review and meta-analysis  compared VP to BKP. The results showed no difference in short- and longterm  pain relief, functional recovery, local kyphosis correction, and vertebral height maintenance. BKP injected more cement volume and had a lower cement leakage rate(25) Authors of another systematic review and meta-analysis  also compared VP to BKP. The results for clinical outcomes were similar, with no difference in visual analog scale (V AS) scores and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores. They did find that BKP significantly decreased the kyphotic wedge angle, decreased risk of cement leakage, and increased postoperative vertebral body height compared to VP(26) SpineJackprocedure is a new type of vertebral augmentation system. Authors of a study (N = 30) investigated the longterm  safety and clinical outcomes of SpineJackprocedure compared to BKP in patients with osteoporotic VCF(27) At the 3-year  follow-up,  results showed that both techniques were safe and improved clinical symptoms, with no differences between groups. The vertebral body height restoration/kyphosis correction was better with the SpineJackprocedure Authors of a meta-analysis  compared VP to nonoperative treatment for osteoporotic VCFs. VP showed variable outcomes. The procedure was effective and safe in all patients with VCFs and the risk of new VCF was similar between groups. They concluded that VP was beneficial for patients with acute osteoporotic VCFwho were experiencing persistent and severe pain, but not for patients with older fractures or nonsevere symptoms. The authors noted that more consistent inclusion criteria would make it easier to compare results in future studies Open surgical stabilization is not as common but may be required if the fracture is considered unstable. It is often difficult to perform in osteoporotic VCFs due to the reduced amount and quality of bone(22)",

Pain was lower in the calcitonin salmon group than in the control group with high certainty at week 1. Due to the heterogeneity of the studies the efficacy of the medication at week 4 was unclear. They concluded that calcitoninsalmon  is beneficial and appears safe for treating acute pain associated with VCF, but more studies would improve the certainty of evidence(28) Other medications should be aimed at improving bone quality and thus reducing the risk of future fractureBisphosphonates are the most common medications prescribed for osteoporosis treatment.

Some observational studies have associated physical activity with increased VCF fracture risk due to falls and low bone density(17) Back-extensor  strengthening exercises may delay time to refracture, based on a retrospective cohort study (N = 57) in the United States(9) \u2013The participants (all over age 55 years and with \u2265 1 radiographically confirmed nontraumatic VCF) received one of three interventions -Exercise therapy (including back-extensor  strengthening exercises) -VP -Exercise therapy and VP \u2013Median time before refracture -Exercise only: 60.4 months (significantly greater length of time compared to other two groups) -VP only: 4.5 months -Both treatments: 20.4 months (significantly greater length of time compared to VP-only  group)  Orthosis/bracing \u2013Orthoses/braces may provide support for a period of 4 to 12 weeks following a VCF. A midthoracic and upper lumbar VCF can be treated with a thoracolumbosacral orthosis; a lower lumbar VCF may need a lumbosacral corset. Discontinuation of the brace is based on the radiographic evidence of healing(21) \u2013Orthoses/braces may be helpful for temporary support but there is little evidence to support their efficacy(22) Mindfulness and modified medical yoga \u2013Authors of an RCT (N = 15)investigated the effect of a mindfulness and modified medical yoga program in older adults with a diagnosed osteoporotic VCF. The patients were randomized to either a theory group or to a mindfulness/modified medical yoga group(30) -The theory group received 60-minute  educational sessions on 9 different topicsover the course of 10 weeks -The mindfulness/modified medical yoga group received similar educational sessions over the 10 weeks along with 30 minutes of mindfulness training and 30 minutes of modified medical yoga. The medical yoga positions were individually adapted to each participant. Positions of strenuous spinal flexion, spinal rotation, bending the trunk to end-range  positions, and exercises with straight legs were all avoided -Pain did not change in any group postintervention. In the mindfulness/modified medical yoga group both sleep quality and perceived stress were improved postintervention, but not in the theory group.There was no difference between the mindfulness/modified medical yoga group and the theory group regarding median values for stress, sleep, present pain, pain during the past week, and worst pain postintervention .

Weight-bearing  exercises can help improve bone quality in patients with osteoporosis, but the type of exercises and intensity needs to be monitored to avoid over stressing the spine. Spinal flexion exercises increasethe rate of further vertebral fracture. Exercises should focus on strengthening back extensors, isometric contraction of paraspinal muscles, and careful loading of the upper extremities(10)",
