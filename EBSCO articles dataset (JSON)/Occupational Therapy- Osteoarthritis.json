            "Osteoarthritis (OA) has been found to be the leading cause of disability in those over 65 years of age.(2) OA is a progressive loss of joint cartilage leading to changes in subchondral bone and changes at joint margins. OA is no longer considered a condition of wear and tear associated with aging. Most patients with symptomatic OA experience an inflammatory component. Over the past 10 years new knowledge on cartilage has led to a change in the approach to treatment of OA(1)",
