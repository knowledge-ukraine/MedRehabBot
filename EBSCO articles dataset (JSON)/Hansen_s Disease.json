            "Leprosy (or Hansen\u2019s disease) is an infectious, slowly progressive disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae . In early stages, leprosy is a mild skin infection curable with standard antibiotic management. Untreated, the bacillus infection permanently damages nerves to the skin; peripheral sensory and motor nerve fibers become thickened, leading to loss of sensation and muscle weakness in the extremities. Mucosa in the upper airways and eyes can be involved in some cases(1)",
            "Early antibiotic treatment prevents nerve involvement, which is the hallmark of disability in leprosy; however, diagnosis is often delayed. Social stigma, primarily caused by disfiguring skin sores, often causes persons with signs of leprosy to withdraw from medical management for their disabilities even when no longer contagious with M. leprae .Consequently, persons with leprosy report reduced physical and emotional aspects to their quality of life (QOL)(1,9) \u2013Brazilian authorities adopted the term Hansen\u2019s disease in 1975 and have reported reduced stigmatization and discrimination associated with using this name instead of leprosy (13) \u2013Global efforts to treat leprosy have been negatively affected by stigmatization and discrimination(13) -The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) report that many people around the world continue to suffer from this curable disease due to lack of access to basic medical care and continued stigma surrounding the illness(19) \u2013The term mycobacterial neurodermatosis might be preferred by persons with the disease and by the medical community as Hansen,the physician who discovered M. leprae,was found guilty of human experimentation, and because mycobacterial neurodermatosis is an accurate term given the WHO criteria(13)",
            "Leprosy is the leading infectious cause of disability worldwide and is a significant public health concern in some developing large countries \u2013According to WHO, in 2018, reports of official figures from 159 countries from the 6 WHO regions indicated that there were 208,619 new leprosy cases registered globally.The WHO reported a prevalence rate of 0.2/1000, based on 184,212 cases at the end of 2018. \u201d(3) \u2013India, Brazil, and Thailand have the highest number of reported cases annually(1) \u2013According to statistics from the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), the current number of identified cases in the United States is approximately 6,500, with about 3,300 requiring active medical management. In 2018 185 new cases  were reported in the United States;72% of these cases occurred in Florida, California, Hawaii, Louisiana, New York, Arkansas, and Texas(4) -Leprosy is often not diagnosed quickly in the United States because practitioners not familiar with the disease do not consider it in the differential diagnosis \u2013WHO considers leprosy to be a neglected tropical disease (i.e., disease that generally afflicts the world's poor and historically has not received as much attention as other diseases)(10) \u2013The WHO Global Leprosy Update indicates the case rate of leprosy situation by region or country(10) \u2013Although leprosy transmission is rare within nearly all developed countries, new cases were found in Australia as recent as 2015 due to migrants from areas where leprosy is endemic(5) \u2013Wild armadillos are a potential vector of M. leprae and thus should not be handled(4)",

            "Once transmitted, M. leprae replicates in the skin histiocytes and Schwann nerve cells(1)\u2013Mycobacterial antigens in affected nerves eventually activate specific T cells that initiate chronic inflammatory reactions\u2013Swelling inside the perineurium (which is inflexible) gradually leads to ischemia and fibrosis with axonal death\u2013Nerve destruction is typically diffuse and symmetric",
