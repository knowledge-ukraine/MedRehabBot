            "WBV is often considered controversial, as high-quality  evidence that supports or fails to support its clinical use is limited. Additional high-quality  studies are warranted. Described below are several areas in which literature has examined potential beneficial effects and potential populations that may benefit",
            "Strength and power \u2013Authors of a study (N = 14) investigated the effectson cycling sprint performance of adding WBV training to a preconditioning exercise (26) -All subjects were trained males who had engaged regularly in regional, national, or international competitions in running, cross-country  skiing, or cycling -Each subject performed 2 test sessions, one with WBV and one without WBV (sessions were separated by 48 hours) -Test session:Subjects performed 15-minute self-selected  warmup on a cycle ergometer. After 3 minutes,they performed a 10-second  all-out  cycling sprint (used as reference condition). After 15 minutes of recovery, subjects either performed 30 seconds of body-loaded  half squats with WBV at 40 Hz (experimental group) or with no WBV (control group). After 1 minute of rest,they performed another 10-second  all-out  cycling sprint -Surface EMG was measured in the vastus medialis, vastus lateralis, and gastrocnemius medialis during the sprints. Additional outcome measures were blood lactate, HR, and RPE taken immediately after the sprint -Adding 30 seconds of WBV to body-loaded  squats produced higher peak and mean power output during the 10-second all-out  cycling sprint compared with no WBV . However, when compared to the reference condition the addition of WBV body-loaded  squats did not produce higher peak and power output. No differences were seen in blood lactate, HR, or RPE -The authors concluded that the use of WBV may have beneficial effects in sprint training sessions or before sprint races, as WBV may have the potential to increase peak power production \u2013Authors of an RCT (N = 37) examined the effects of a 6-month WBV training on lower body strength, lower body power, and swimming performance in trained swimmers(31)  -Subjects in the WBV group performed 3 sessions of WBV per week for 24 weeks. Exercises with WBV included half squatting, squatting to 90\u00b0, dynamic squat from 120\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 bent knees at a range of 2 seconds up and 2 seconds down, and static lunge with right then left foot forward -Subjects in the control group continued their normal routines through the 24 weeks -Outcome measures includedisometric lower body tests (knee extension and half squat), lower body power tests (vertical and horizontal jumps and 30-meter sprint), and swimming time in 100 meters -There were no significant differences between groups in any outcome measure -A 6-month  WBV training did not produce any additional improvements in lower body strength, lower body power, or swimming performance \u2013Authors of a systematic review and meta-analysis  assessed the effects of resistance exercise, WBV , or electrical stimulation on muscle strength, body composition, and functional outcomes in older adults(34) -64 RCTs were included in the systematic review (48 resistance exercise, 12 WBV , and 4 electrical stimulation) -Knee extension strength was improved with resistance exercise and WBV , but not with electrical stimulation -Small effects occurred in body composition with resistance exercise, but the effects were not conclusive with WBV or electrical stimulation -Most functional outcomes improved with resistance exercise -Further studies are needed to compare the effects of WBV and electrical stimulation to resistance exercise \u2013Higher frequencies, higher amplitudes, and longer durations of vibration per treatment sessions facilitate improvements in explosive power(12) \u2013WBV training improves lower-extremity  strength and is associated with decreased fall-related  hospitalization in older adults(18) -Fifty-one  older adults (> 65 years) who did not exercise regularly and could stand independently were included in this study in Taiwan. Participants were randomized into three groups: WBV , visual feedback-deprived  plus WBV (VFDWBV), and a control group. VFDWBV participants used a blindfold during treatment to deprive visual field -Both WBV and VFDWBV groups received treatment of 5-minute  sessions 3 times per week for a duration of 3 months. Protocol included a peak amplitude of 4 mm at 20 Hz, with a peak acceleration of 1.5 g -Participants were assessed before and after treatment and at a 6-month  follow-up.  Outcome measures were limits of stability, knee flexor/extensor strength, and incidence of falls -Results -Limits of stability improved significantly in both the WBV and the WFDWBV groups post treatment, which remained significant at the 6-month follow-up -The VFDWBV group showed statistically significant post-treatment  knee extensor and flexor strength increases of 37.89% and 19.40%, respectively. The WBV group had significant post-treatment  improvement in knee extensor strength only (15.40%). There was no significant strength improvement noted in the control group -At the 6-month  follow up, incidence of falls in the WBV , VFDWBV , and control groups were 0%, 0%, and 28.57%, respectively \u2013Based on a study in Hong Kong, WBV combined with standing exercise can produce significantly greater muscle EMG amplitude compared to the same exercise with no WBV . Authors conclude that WBV can induce muscle activity similar to higher-intensity  protocols in older adults (mean age 61.4 years)(19) -Exercise included vastus lateralis, biceps femoris, tibialis anterior, and gastrocnemius",
            "Balance and proprioception \u2013Authors of a study (N = 24) evaluated the effect of WBV training on postural control in congenitally blind subjects(25) -12 males with congenital blindness were compared to 12 males with no visual impairment -WBV training consisted of 5 sets of 1 minuteon the vibration platform with 1 minute rest between each set -Postural sway was measured at baseline, immediately after WBV , and 10 minutes and 20 minutes after WBV -No differences in postural sway (measured by analyzing the center of pressure displacements) were found in either group following WBV training -Acute WBV training did not alter postural control in patients with congenital blindness. It is a safe modality to use with these patients and a more long-term  application may produce more benefits for this population \u2013Authors of a study investigated if an acute bout of WBV training could improve arthrogenic muscle inhibition (AMI) and proprioception in patients with chronic ankle instability(32)  -10 patients with chronic ankle instability and 10 age-matched  controls participated in a sham/control program and a WBV program -WBV training did not decrease arthrogenic muscle inhibition or improve proprioception in either healthy controls or those with chronic ankle instability \u2013Authors of a study (N = 34) investigated the effects of WBV and WBV while wearing unstable shoes compared to a control group in patients with chronic ankle instability(36) -WBV group training had 3 session per week for 4 weeks. The patients performed various exercises at a progressive duration and frequency of vibration (30 Hz to 40 Hz and 35 seconds to 60 seconds) -WBV with unstable shoes (WBV-S)  performed the same exercises as the WBV group but wore shoes to whichrockers were attached -The control group received no intervention -Outcome measures included a modified star excursion balance test (mSEBT), hop test, muscle strength, and joint position sense -The WBV group and the WBV-S  group, but not the control group, had a significant increase in their mSEBT in the anterior and posterolateral directions from baseline. The WBV-S  group had a significant increase in their hop distance but there were no significant changes for the WBV group or control group. There were no significant changes in the other outcome measures -WBV and WBV-Scan  help improve dynamic balance in patients with chronic ankle instability",
            "Flexibility and ROM \u2013Authors of a systematic review (5 studies) showed that use of WBV training either in isolation or with use of other stretching programs can produce improvements in hamstring flexibility in physically active adults(17) \u2013Based on an RCT study conducted in the United States, a single session of WBV can increase knee flexion excursion, which may improve running characteristics in individuals with knee pathology(22) -Twenty participants with ACL repair participated in a single session of WBV -Results show an increase in knee flexion excursion and a reduction in loading rate in the injured limb after a single session of WBV training",
            "Muscle soreness \u2013Authors of an RCT who investigated whether WBV had benefits for lower-extremity  muscle fatigue concluded that WBV did not provide any recovery benefits(21)",
            "Blood flow \u2013Authors of a 2019 systematic review investigated the effects of WBV training on peripheral circulation. WBV training at frequencies \u2264 30 Hz improved peripheral blood flow and/or skin temperature of the lower extremity. The results of WBV training at higher frequencies (31 Hz\u201350  Hz) had conflicting results among participants.The long-term  effectof chronic exposure to WBV training was not evaluated and should be investigated in future studies(24)",
            "Specific populations \u2013Authors of a 2019 systematic review and meta-analysis analyzed the effects of WBV training in patients with PD. Studies did not find that WBV training reduced PD symptoms (motor symptoms, balance, gait, and mobility(27) \u2013Authors of study (N = 35) compared various single-session dose-response  effects of WBV on spasticity and walking speed in patients with SCI(28) -Four different doses of WBV were tested in all patients: high frequency (50 Hz)/short duration (180 seconds), high frequency/long duration (360 seconds), low frequency (30 Hz)/short duration, and low frequency/long duration. A control group performed the same exercises but with sham electrodes -Quadriceps spasticity and walking speed (10-meter walk test) were measured at baseline, immediately after, and 45 minutes after WBV training -Overall, no frequency/duration combination was significantly different from the control group -The only difference noted was in patients with high spasticity. Participants in the higher frequency/longer duration group and the control group had a significant decrease in spasticity immediately after the intervention -Further research is needed to explore if there may be cumulative effects of WBV training on spasticity in patients with SCI \u2013Authors of 2018 meta-analysis  compared the effectiveness of WBV in patients with stroke. The effect size was small for the following outcome measures: muscle strength, balance, and gait. The effect size was moderate for bone metabolism and spasticity. WBV is a safe treatment for patients with stroke(29)  \u2013Researchers who conducted an RCT on WBV training found decreased levels of spasticity for those with chronic stroke(9) -Eighty-two  chronic stroke patients were included in this study in Hong Kong. Participants performed 24 sessions over 8 weeks and were randomized to either the WBV group or the control group -Both groups participated in six different exercises while standing on the WBV platform. The control group performed exercises on the platform but without vibration -Exercises on the WBV platform include side-to-side weight shift, semi-squat,  squat with 30\u00b0 flexion, forward lunge, standing on paretic leg and non-paretic  leg alternately, and deep squat (90\u00b0 knee flexion) -Frequency of the WBV platform was set between 20 and 30 Hz, with amplitude ranging from 0.4 to 0.6mm, for a maximum duration of 15 minutes -Results from this experiment revealed a decrease in knee spasticity levels in the WBV group over time, with a lower MAS score from baseline measures after a 1-month  reassessment. Control group showed no changes in spasticity levels -Although this study showed improvements in spasticity in the WBV group, further research is warranted \u2013WBV training in the horizontal direction (moves anteriorly/posteriorly only) can improve motor function and balance in patients with chronic stroke(13) -An RCT from South Korea involving 21 patients (12 patients in WBV group, 9 patients in control group) took place over the course of 6 weeks for 20 minutes per day, 3 times per week -WBV group stood on platform with hips and knees in slight flexion with frequency of 1\u20133 Hz with amplitude of 30 mm in the horizontal direction. Patients stood for 10 minutes facing one direction with the platform going in the anterior/ posterior direction, followed by changing stance to move in the lateral position -Conventional therapy was given to both groups that consisted of muscle facilitation exercises, balance training, and gait training for 30 minutes per day, 5 times per week -Results indicated that those in the WBV group had significant improvements from baseline in Fugl-Meyer,  BBS, and TUG scores. The control group did not have significant improvements in any variables \u2013WBV training performed in the sitting position can improve static/dynamic sitting balance and functional reach for patients with chronic stroke(14) -An RCT study from South Korea with 30 patients (15 experimental, 15 control) who participated in training 5 times a week for 4 weeks. Both groups performed conventional physical therapy consisting of task-oriented  activities in the sitting position for 15 minutes. The experimental group performed WBV training for an additional 15 minutes -The frequency and amplitude for the WBV were set at15\u201322  Hz and 0\u20135.8,  respectively. Patients were then asked to perform static sitting activities, functional reaching for objects in multiple directions beyond arm\u2019s length using non-paretic side, functional reaching for objects beyond arm\u2019s length using paretic side, and bilateral reaching -Results indicate that those in the WBV group had improved scores on outcome measures for functional reach and improvements in dynamic sitting balance \u2013Authors of a study (N = 32) examined the influence of WBV frequency, amplitude, and body posture on lower-limb muscle activation in patients with chronic stroke(33) -Each subjectperformed 3 different exercises with 3 different vibration conditions (frequencies: 20 Hz, 30 Hz, and 40 Hz; amplitude: 0.8 mm and 1.5 mm) with and without WBV -Muscle activation in the vastus medialis, medial hamstrings, tibialis anterior, and medial gastrocnemius was measured -Subjects who exercised with WBV had significantly greater muscle activity in the medial gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior, and medial hamstrings than without WBV -Vibration conditions with higher amplitude or higher frequency resulted ingreater muscle activation \u2013Authors of a study (N = 43) assessed the effects of WBV training on balance and walking performance in patients with stroke(38) -All patients received 3 weeks of conventional rehabilitation. The WBV group received WBV training in addition to conventional rehabilitation, while the control group did not receive any additional training -At the end of treatment, the WBV group showed significant improvements in BBS and TUG scores, step length, and walking speed compared to the control group -WBV training improved balance and gait performance in patients with stroke \u2013Authors of an RCT (N = 61) compared pelvic floor muscle training with WBV training to pelvic floor muscle training alone in patients with stress urinary incontinence following prostatectomy(30) -Outcome measures included Incontinence V AS score (I-V AS),  International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire\u2013Urinary  Incontinence Short Form (ICIQ-UI-SF)  score and a 24-hour  pad test  -Both groups received treatment for pelvic floor muscle training 3 times a week for 4 weeks. The experimental group received pelvic floor muscle training along with WBV (20 Hz for the first 2 sessions and then 40 Hz for the remaining sessions) -There was a significant difference between groups in all outcome measures in favor of the experimental group after 4 weeks of intervention and at the 2-month  follow-up \u2013Authors of an RCT (N = 26) investigated the short-  and long-term  effects of WBV training on spasticity and motor performance in children with hemiparetic CP(35) -The WBV training group received WBV training (15-minute  sessions 3 times per week for 8 weeks) in addition to a conventional physical therapy program (45-minute  sessions 2 times per week for 8 weeks). The control group received only the conventional physical therapy program -The WBV training group showed significant improvements in gross motor functions, gait and balance skills, and in lower and upper extremity muscle spasticity compared to the control group. At a follow-up12  weeks after the end of treatment, the improvements were maintained \u2013Based on a study in Brazil, WBV training improves balance, mobility, and upper and lower extremity strength in postmenopausal women(20) -Participants were assigned to the WBV training group (n = 62) or the control group (n = 60) and were assessed at baseline and at completion of the 12-month  program -WBV training was performed 20 minutes, 5 times per week, for 12 months. WBV settings utilized a frequency of 60 Hz, intensity of 0.6 g, and amplitude of less than 1 mm. The control group did not receive intervention -Results -Both groups had comparable measures at baseline -At 12-month  follow up, the WBV training group showed statistically significant improvements in isometric and dynamic hip flexor strength, back extensor strength, handgrip strength, arm curl test, reach test, TUG, and static balance. The WBV training group also had greater gains on the reach test at follow-up,  but improvements were not significant. No significant differences were found in the control group \u2013Authors of systematic review evaluated the effects of WBV on health-related  quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with chronic conditions. WBV was not more effective than other types of exercise. Six of the 17 studies reported that WBV improved HRQOL. Theevidence was not strong enough to support WBV in the treatment of chronic conditions(37) \u2013Performed in a seated position, WBV training can result in improvements in gait, Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores and upper limb control, and decreased resting tremors and rigidity(11) \u2013.
