            "The hallmark of diabetes mellitus, type 1 (DM1), is the absence of endogenous insulin production in the pancreas. Consequently, persons with DM1 are dependent on insulin delivery by syringe, pen, pump, or jet injector to prevent the complications of elevated blood glucose concentration (hyperglycemia)",
            "Regular exercise clearly protects against a number of health risks and improves clinical outcomes in persons with DM1across all ages.In addition to general health promotion, exercise is a key adjunct to insulin therapy by increasing insulin sensitivity and reducing the daily amount of insulin needed for glycemic control. Prescribed exercise is, therefore, an important component of DM1 management for preventing or at least delaying complications of DM1 (1,42)",
            "However, careful prescribed physical activity and monitoring is needed for maintaining glycemic controlduring exercise to prevent a symptomatic decline in blood glucose. Controlling the type and duration of exercise, andcarbohydrate feeding when necessary during exercise, may minimize the decline (43,44) Fear of exercise-related  hypoglycemia is understandably a major challenge for persons with DM1participating in regular physical activity,especially children(34) Thus, it is critical that persons with DM1 avoid becoming overinsulinized (i.e., excessive insulin administration) before exercise to reduce the risk of hypoglycemiaduringexercise",
            "Aperson-specific  exercise management plan can enable patients with DM1 to remain vigilant regarding their blood glucose concentration and adjust their insulin dose or carbohydrate intake as needed. (44) Exercise-related  hypoglycemia is not uncommon in prolonged high-intensity  aerobic training, whereas glycemic control is more likely to be maintained in resistance training (45)",
            "On the other hand, blood glucose may become elevated hours after exercise due to counterregulatory glucose defense hormones that increase blood glucose and oppose the effect of insulin. (35,46) Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices are effective for maintaining glycemic controlduring and after exercise (47) or application of equipment Lack of appropriate skin and foot careAppropriate skin and foot carePatient education See Clinical Review\u2026 Diabetic Foot Ulcer referenced aboveSee Clinical Review\u2026 Diabetic Foot Ulcer referenced aboveSee Clinical Review\u2026 Diabetic Foot Ulcer referenced above .

            "Diabetic hypoglycemia results from an imbalance in blood glucose homeostasis\u2013The arterial blood glucose supply is insufficient to counterbalance the glucose uptake in tissues\u2013Increased glucose uptake during physical activity/exercise is due to augmented muscle metabolism or excessive insulindosing\u2013Failure to maintain blood glucose level because of insufficient stored glucose supplied by liver and/or insufficientconsumption of glucose-rich  carbohydrate foods",
            "Chronic hyperglycemia in DM1 (blood glucose level routinely higher than 125 mg/dL) and acute hyperglycemia (higherthan 180 mg/dL) may result from:\u2013Lack of pancreatic insulin production\u2013Resistance to insulin (reduced insulin sensitivity) at the cellular level(4)\u2013Systemic infection/inflammation or recovery after prolonged exercise promotes the release of stress hormones (such asglucagon and epinephrine) that stimulate glucose release from the liver\u2013Certain medications used to treat comorbid conditions (e.g., beta-adrenergic  blockers, thiazide diuretics, epinephrine,corticosteroids, glucosamine)",
            "Diabetic ketoacidosis occurs with severe hyperglycemia due to insulin deficiency. It results in rapid oxidation of lipids inthe liver and the release of ketone bodies from the liver. Brain damage can result if blood becomes very acetic (i.e., bloodpH falls)"
        ],
        "pathophysiology": [
            "In nearly all persons with DM1, the pancreas is unable to produce insulin because beta cells in the islets of Langerhanshave been destroyed by diabetes autoimmune disease. Hyperglycemia develops since insulin inhibits glucose release fromthe liver and stimulates the uptake of glucose",
            "Chronic hyperglycemia, which is clinically indicated by elevated glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), generates oxidantsthat promote cellular injury and also increase blood osmolarity with subsequent dehydration of the tissues. Chronichyperglycemia is the major initiator of diabetic microvascular and neural complications, such as retinopathy, neuropathy,and nephropathy.(5) Aerobic or resistance exercise training performed at least twice weekly for a minimum of 2 monthsmay reduce HbA1c levels in adults with DM1(36)\u2013Low-intensity  aerobic exercise performed 4 times per week for 12 weeks by patients with DM1 has been shown to inducesignificant increases in microvascular density and endothelial-dependent  capillary reactivity(39)",
            "Persons with DM1 should monitor their blood glucose concentration and receive insulin subcutaneously (usuallyself-injection  or glucose pump)and/or take oral antidiabetic medications to prevent hyperglycemia\u2013For some patients with DM1, insulin delivery through an insulin pump during exercise can be reduced or the pump can bedisconnected, depending on the duration and intensity of the exercise(17)",
            "Maintaining normoglycemia(70 to 130 mg/dL) in persons with DM1 requires appropriate dosing of exogenous insulin.Achieving target levels of blood glucose with therapeutic insulin involves a delicate balance between the currentblood glucose level and the insulin preparation used, because overinsulinization can cause hypoglycemia. The use ofcombinations of short-acting  and long-acting  insulin preparations has improved the hourly control of blood glucoselevels(6)",
            "In addition to the health-promoting  benefits of regular physical activity, both aerobic and resistance exercise improveinsulin sensitivity and thus enhance glucose uptake. However, this becomes an additional concern in the self-managementof blood glucose levels because excessive glucose uptake in muscle can cause hypoglycemia to develop during and/or afterexercise. Severe hypoglycemia is associated with reduced consciousness (which may cause accidents), coma, convulsions,transient hemiparesis and stroke, cardiac arrhythmias, and myocardial ischemia\u2013The American Diabetes Association recommends that when symptoms of hypoglycemia occur (often suddenly), personswith diabetes should do the following:(3)-Consume 15\u201320  grams of glucose or simple carbohydrates-Authors of a randomized crossover trial (N = 34 adults with DM1 and frequent hypoglycemia) in New Zealand foundthat a weight-based  (0.3 g/kg) glucose dosage was more effective than a standard dose of 15 g for treating symptomatichypoglycemia(40)-Recheck blood glucose after 15 minutes and if hypoglycemia continues, repeatcarbohydrate intake until a normalglucose level is achieved-Eat a small snack if the next planned meal is more than an hour or two away",
            "Blood glucose supply and demand during physical activity is affected by several factors, including the type, intensity,and duration of exercise as well as the amount of insulin and food in the body at the time of the activity. Low-intensityand moderate-intensity continuous exercise increase insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake in muscle. When prolonged forlonger than 30 minutes, this type of exercise often begins to lower blood glucose in persons with DM1. The pre-exerciseblood glucose level, insulin dose, and carbohydrate intake should be appropriately managed in order to reduce thedevelopment of hypoglycemia(7,8)",
            "Another problem in glycemic control during prolonged low- and moderate-intensity  exercise is when the increasedsecretion of counterregulatory glucose defense hormones (i.e., glucagon, epinephrine, and growth hormone) does notincrease hepatic glucose production enough to prevent a fall in blood glucose",
            "Also, patients with DM1 are often unaware of their falling blood glucose during exercise until symptoms occur.(17)Typically, carbohydrate intake is needed to maintain blood glucoseduring exercise longer than 30\u201345  minutes (43,46)",
            "In contrast, short, intermittent, and high-intensity  physical activity (e.g., resistance exercise/weight lifting, sprints, andinterval exercise) may counteract exercise-related  hypoglycemia by raising blood glucose levels through the stimulationof counterregulatory hormone secretion to promote hepatic glucose production. (9,45) However, moderate aerobic exercisemay blunt the effect of resistance exercise on increasing the growth hormone response\u2013Authors of a small study (N = 11 patients with DM1, mean age 33 years) in Canada found that weight lifting beforetreadmill running exercise was more effective for increasing blood growth hormone levels compared to weight liftingafter treadmill exercise(37)",
            "Glycemic control in DM1 thus involves careful planning for exercise and monitoring of blood glucose levels before,during, and sometimes for long periods after exercise (44)",
            "Sometimes, post-exercise  hypoglycemia may develop if a sufficient amount of glucose-rich  food is not eaten forhours afterexercise.(17) In one study, hypoglycemia occurred up to 31 hours after exercise(10)",
            "Another method for reducing the development of hypoglycemia hours after intense exercise is to reduce the insulin dosewhile monitoring blood glucose, preferably with a CGM (47)",
            "General target levels of blood glucose concentration in adults with diabetes(11)\u2013Before meals: 70 to 130 mg/dL\u2013One to two hours after starting a meal: less than 180 mg/dL"

            "Prolonged periods of not eating, including overnight fasting (leading to nocturnal hypoglycemia), can increase the riskof severe hypoglycemia. Symptoms during sleep may go undetected. Patients with a history of profuse sweating at nightand morning headache or feeling weak and shaky in the morning are candidates for glucose monitoring during sleep andpossible revision of their insulin regimen to compensate for extrinsic factors that can contribute to nocturnal hypoglycemia,such as insulin dose, exercise, or fasting(13)",

            "Sprint exercise also appears to be effective for improving counterregulatory hormone responses to subsequent moderate aerobic exercise. For example, a 10-second  maximal cycling sprint immediately before low-intensity  exercise (40% of estimated aerobic capacity) for 20 minutes was found to prevent a post-exercise  drop in blood glucose level(26)",
            "Authors of a 2011 review found that reduction of insulin dose and feeding 75 grams of low glycemic index carbohydrates before running was the best strategy for preventing a post-exercise  drop in blood glucose level. The best timing for carbohydrate ingestion was 30 minutes before exercise(27)",
            "Capillary blood glucose should be monitored before exercise, immediately after, and at 2-hour  intervals at the beginning of a new exercise program, until the patient is aware of predictable changes and, if indicated, can compensate by eating glucose-rich foods(28)",
