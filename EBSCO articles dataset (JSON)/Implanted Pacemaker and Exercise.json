            "An implanted cardiac pacemaker is a pulse generator that contains a battery, electronics, and leads. The leads travel to the myocardium and send depolarizing pulses as well as monitor electrical activity of the heart. The stimulus applied to the heart is measured by amplitude (volts) and duration (milliseconds). Optimization of these measurements is important to prolong battery life and reduce risk of stimulation of nearby tissues, such as the phrenic nerve(1)",
            "The most common indications for placement of a pacemaker are(1,2) \u2013HR that is too slow and associated with symptoms (symptomatic bradycardia) \u2013HR that fails to increase appropriately with exercise or general physical activity (chronotropic incompetence [CI]) \u2013diseases of the A V node, sinus node, or His-Purkinje  system that disrupt cardiac signaling and are due to inflammation, infarction, aging, or fibrosis \u2013sinus node dysfunction \u2013acquired atrioventricular (A V) block \u2013chronic bifascicular block \u2013following acute myocardial infarction \u2013after cardiac transplantation \u2013congenital heart disease \u2013hypertrophic cardiomyopathy \u2013neurocardiogenic syncope and hypersensitive carotid sinus syndrome \u2013tachycardia \u2013cardiac resynchronization therapy for patients with severe systolic heart failure",
            "CI occurs when the heart is unable to achieve 70% of the age-predicted  HR maximum (or 100bpm) during maximum physical exertion;(1) it can contribute to disability and a reduction in ADLs(3)",
            "Pacemaker implantationimprovesCI (i.e., increase in HR and thus cardiac output) during exerciseusing an accelerometer that detects motion of the body(1)",

            "Prescribed exercise training is indicated in patients with pacemakers to counteract the cardiovascular deconditioning and muscle atrophy that may have developed because of disability, as well as to further improve functional capacity, hemodynamic measures, physical activity, and quality of life(3,5) ",
