            "A 30-item,  self-report  questionnaire developed jointly by the Institute for Work & Health and the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, designed to quantify disability and symptom experience of individuals with musculoskeletal disorders of the upper extremity(1,3) and monitor change in function over time \u2013Additional 4-item  modules are optional for use in assessing function in the upper extremities of workers who require a high level of physical activity or in persons involved in athletics or performing arts \u2013A shorter version of the tool is also available (QuickDASH), but use of the full version is recommended for clinical use(2)",
            "Due to its focus on musculoskeletal disorders, the disability component emphasizes physical function \u2013Social and emotional function are included but to a lesser degree",
            "It differs from many commonly used measures that have been developed for a specific joint or a specific disorder in that it is designed to be used in the presence of any or multiple disorders in the upper extremity",
            "The DASH Outcome Measure has been adapted for use globally and has been translated into 54 languages and dialects(2)",
            "The DASH was one of nine assessments that were agreed upon by the European consensus group (hand surgery, hand therapy, and physical medicine and rehabilitation) as appropriate for assessment of impairment and activity limitation in patients with upper extremity involvement(15)"

The researchers also found that the majority of the clinicians participating in the survey were using the DASH and QuickDASH in patients over age 65 and that some were using it with patients younger than 15 (22)"

            "Validity \u2013Significant correlations with the Neck Disability Index, the visual analogue scale (V AS)for pain, and the SF-36  have been reported, indicating adequate to excellent criterion validity and construct validity \u2013The DASH Outcome Measure and QuickDASH have a lot of published data related to their psychometric properties; however, the authors of a systematic review assessing the psychometric properties of site-specific patient-reported outcome measures for upper extremity conditions found that although the evidence indicates that the DASH and QuickDASH performance well, some of the studies were of poor quality. In addition, formal testing of invariance and differential item functioning found that with some task-specific  items (e.g., carrying a heavy object) there are sex-related issues. In tested populations, the responsiveness of the DASH to change may also vary by diagnosis.(4)  \u2013In a study conducted in Canada, the DASH Outcome Measure did not display adequate evidence of validity for use with patients with Dupuytren\u2019s contracture(9) \u2013Grip strength and grip strength ratio (grip strength in the injured or nondominant hand divided by grip strength in the noninjured or dominant hand) correlate with the DASH Outcome Measure(10) -Based on a study conducted in the Netherlands involving 3 groups: 20 healthy volunteers, 17 patients with distal radius fractures and 12 patients with different hand or wrist conditions -The correlation between grip strength ratio and DASH scores were much stronger than the correlation between grip strength and DASH scores \u2013Correlation to other physical and nonphysical outcome measures of shoulder disorders demonstrates good construct validity in shoulder disorders with both the DASH and QuickDASH(8)",
            "Reliability and validity of the measure have been confirmed in other versions of the DASH, including: \u2013Norwegian(12) \u2013Persian(13) \u2013Chinese (Mainland)(14) \u2013Chinese (Hong Kong) (19) \u2013Hindi(17) \u2013British English (20)",
            "Internal consistency \u2013Both the DASH Outcome Measure and the QuickDASH possess good internal consistency(8)",
            "Ceiling/floor effects \u2013Theoretically, floor effects and ceiling effects can occur and would be relevant depending on the population of interest(11) -For example, in studying shoulder disorders, floor effects may be relevant in a group of patients with brachial plexus injuries, whereas ceiling effects may limit the usefulness of the tool in professional baseball pitchers with shoulder pain who may obtain a perfect score despite potential for improvement with treatment(11) \u2013Ceiling and floor effects have not been reported in field testing and longitudinal studies.(1) The DASH Outcome Measure does not have the tendency to underestimate symptoms and overestimate disability that has been reported with theQuickDASH(5)",
            "Responsiveness  (21) \u2013The DASH, as well as the MHQ and Duru\u00f6z Hand Index (DHI), are responsive tools for detecting change related to treatment in patients with traumatic hand injuries \u2013Researchers in Turkey designed a study to assess the responsiveness of the DASH, MHQ, and DHI to changes in self-reported  hand function, pain, and disability following treatment for traumatic hand injury. They found that all of the assessments were responsive to treatment-induced changes, with the MHQ the most responsive of the three (21)"

The assigned values for all completed responses are summed and averaged to get a score out of 5. This value is then transformed to a score out of 100 by subtracting 1 and multiplying by 25. A higher score indicates greater disability \u2013The goal of the optional module is to identify specific difficulties that professional athletes and performing artists or other workers might have that could go undetected in the 30-item  portion of the DASH Outcome Measure because they may not affect ADLs -All 4 optional items must be answered in order to calculate the high-performance  score. The assigned values for each response are added up and the total is divided by 4 (the number of items). This is converted to a score out of 100 by subtracting1 and multiplying by 25",
            "Normative data collected in a large general population surveyindicate that members of the general population would score 10.1 on the DASH Outcome Measure with a standard deviation of 14.68 (7)"
