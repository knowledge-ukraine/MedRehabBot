            "Symptoms of a developmental LI typically appear within the first 2 to 3 years of life. The child often has had normaldevelopment in all areas but began talking late or had difficulties learning to talk and difficulties understanding complexlanguage.(10) The child might have also had immature speech-sound  production during the preschool years(10)\u2013In a study conducted in the United Kingdom comparing language abilities in typically developing children (n = 38) tothose of children with LI (n = 13), researchers found atypical trajectories of phonological development in the childrenwith LI. Additionally, the relationship between lexical and phonological knowledge in children with LI was abnormalcompared to that of the typically developing children. Researchers hypothesized that these abnormalities likely contributeto LI because children with LI might have more difficulty abstracting phonological knowledge from lexical knowledge,might have more difficulty learning new words because of abnormal phonological knowledge, or might only be capableof reaching an immature stage of language development because of the limited phonological knowledge(48)\u2013In a study conducted in the United States with 41 Russian-speaking  children (in 18 of whom LI was diagnosed),researchers found that despite intact representational syntactic knowledge, processing capacity limitations resulted inon-line  impairments of grammatical construction in the children with LI. Additionally, some of the language deficitsobserved appeared to be related to deficits of phonological short-term  memory capacity(49)\u2013In a study conducted in the United Kingdom with 22 children (ages 8 to 12) with SLI, researchers compared acousticperception abilities between the children with SLI and typically developing, age-matched  peers. Results indicated that,compared to the typically developing children, children with SLI exhibited reduced perception of two of the four acoustictasks: rise time and duration. Additionally, children with SLI exhibited reduced ability to perceive lexical stress patternsas compared to the typically developing children(57)",
            "Authors of a meta-analysis  examined published and unpublished research on statistical learning abilities in persons withSLI compared to persons without SLI. Statistical learning is the manner in which typically developing children learnlanguage. Statistical learning occurs as listeners unconsciously hear and recognize patterns (statistical regularities) ofsyntax, morphology, and phonology. The authors of this meta-analysis  reported that research indicates that persons withSLI appear to have a deficit in statistical learning compared to persons without SLI, which might contribute to difficultylearning and using verbal language(60)"

Expository discourse samples (discourse that informs, explains, or describes) have been found to yield more group differences between adolescents with LI and those without LI than conversational samples.(23) The SLP might wish to employ an expository -Observations of the student in the classroom or lunchroom can be informative for pragmatic language assessment (23) -\"Why do you like that game/sport?\" -\"I'm not familiar with that game/sport. Tell me about it. What are the rules, objectives, number of players, and so on?\" -\"What are some strategies to win the game/sport? How can you become a good player?\"(24) -Place four envelopes containing a wordless picture book on a table. The envelopes can all contain the same wordless picture book (e.g., Frog Where Are You?  Mayer, 1969; What Next, Baby Bear?  Murphy, 1983; Pancakes for Breakfast , dePaola, 1978; A Boy, a Dog, and a Frog , Mayer, 1967) -Tell the student that all four envelopes contain a different story.

Remember to tell me exactly all of the details so that I\u2018Once upon a time\u2026\u2019\" -Some children and adolescents with LI are able to tell oral narratives but struggle with written narratives.(25) Take a written sample narrative\"Can you tell me some of the things this person does that annoy you?\"(24) This narrative topic can illuminate any grammatical errors and is more aligned with the everyday language of a teenager than a story narrative(24) -Language samples (50\u2013100  utterances minimum for a full sample; shorter utterances to measure targeted skills) can be recorded and then analyzed for vocabulary, syntax, and pragmatic skills. Syntactic measures include mean length of terminable units (T-units)  (syntactic structures that include a main clause with all subordinate clauses), subordinate clause production, clausal density (average number of clauses per T-unit),  and syntactic errors.

Assess reading and writing ability as necessary and age appropriate. The components of the reading evaluation will depend on the age of the child and his or her developmental level. These components include letter identification, letter-sound  identification, phonological awareness skills, sight word reading, fluency, and reading comprehension.(50) Written language tasks might include a written narrative -In a study in the United States designed to examine the use of abstract nouns and metacognitive verbs in a narrative writing sample of school-aged children and adolescents, researchers asked participants to \u201cwrite a story about something funny, sad, or scary that happened to you and a friend.\u201d(27) Researchers found that participants were engaged with this task and were reluctant to stop after the allotted 20 minutes. Narratives were analyzed with respect to total T-units,  mean length of T-unit,  clausal density, use of abstract nouns, and metacognitive verbs.

Several service-delivery  models are used to deliver language intervention in the U.S. public school system: individual therapy, small-group  therapy, collaboration with the teacher to deliver intervention within the classroom, and consultation with the teacher or teacher-aide to assist in delivering language intervention. There is no evidence to support one method over another; however, it is recognized that language goals should be linked to the curriculum when possible to provide multiple exposures to targeted language concepts (e.g., teaching vocabulary that is specific to content area classes)(4) \u2013Response to Intervention (RTI): The RTI approach is a multitiered framework that involves universal screening to identify students who are at risk for language and reading difficulties, systematic evidence-based  classroom instruction, ongoing progress monitoring, and implementation of effective interventions for students who require more intensive instruction.(31) The first level (Tier 1) of the model involves providing high-quality,  evidence-based  instruction in a general education classroom. All students are screened at the beginning of the school year with a criterion-referenced  or norm-referenced  instrument to determine which students might benefit from additional instruction (e.g., students who fall below the 25th percentile on a screening measure). The second stage of the model (Tier 2) consists of small-group instruction and is directed toward students who continue to have difficulties despite the high-quality intervention. Their responsiveness to more intensive intervention is monitored after relatively short periods of time (e.g., 8 weeks). Tier 3  is provided for students who respond minimally to the second tier intervention and require specialized, more intensive instruction. When students fail to respond or respond minimally to the most intensive tier of instruction (Tier 3), they receive a comprehensive evaluation to determine their eligibility for special education services(31) -Cited advantages of the RTI approach include identification of students with language difficulties before they experience extensive academic failure, decreased numbers of students placed in special education, increased accountability for student performance in general and special education, reduced number of comprehensive evaluations, and increased time for collaboration among school professionals(32) -Studies investigating the effectiveness of the RTI approach in the upper elementary grades are limited(33,34) -SLPs often work in collaboration with general and special education teachers within an RTI model in roles such as the following: -Soliciting referrals from social studies and English teachers for students who would benefit from more intensive language instruction(35) -Providing direct service to students who need intensive language instruction. This instruction should be aligned with the curriculum(35) -Collaborating with school professionals to design interventions to improve Tier 1 instruction (e.g., suggest ways that a teacher can provide sufficient exposures to new vocabulary words for students)(36) -Collaborating with teachers to make modifications to the curriculum and instruction(35) -Administering progress-monitoring  measures to determine if the children are meeting benchmarks and to identify those who need additional instruction(36) -For detailed information on RTI, see Clinical Review\u2026Response to Intervention (RTI) ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T709175",
            "Collaborative teacher/SLP intervention \u2013In an RCT in Australia, researchers investigated the efficacy of a collaborative intervention in which SLPs trained mainstream secondary teachers to make modifications in their oral and written language instruction.(37) A cohort of 13 teachers in two secondary schools (7 trained and 6 control) and 43 year-8  students (21 trained and 22 control) were tested preintervention, postintervention, and follow-up  3 months\u2019 postintervention. Dependent measures included observations of the teachers\u2019 use of techniques as well as student assessments in spoken and written language (Wechsler Individual Achievement Test-II  subtests of Listening Comprehension, Reading Comprehension, Written Expression, and Oral Expression). Teacher training was delivered in 10 50-minute  sessions over a period of 10 weeks in small-group  interactive meetings. Language modification techniques included: -teachers\u2019 written language: Teachers were taught to break down large amounts of information on worksheets into smaller, visually distinct sections. They added graphics and visual icons as well as descriptions of instructional vocabulary -teachers\u2019 oral language: Teachers were taught to make instructions explicit rather than implied and allow time for students\u2019 processing and verbal responses. They repeated and paraphrased key instructions and faced the class when giving important information -information processing: Teachers were taught to include the whole class in deconstructing complex texts (e.g., creating mind maps on the board). They involved the whole class in creating visual aids to assist in information retention -direct vocabulary instruction: V ocabulary associated with each curricular topic was prioritized and vocabulary instruction was embedded in students\u2019 learning through activities such as the use of visual symbols and whole-class interactive morphemic analysis \u2013Results indicated a significant increase in the use of language modification techniques by trained teachers at postintervention and follow-up  and significant improvement in treatment group students\u2019 written expression and listening comprehension relative to the control group immediately after intervention. No effects were found for oral expression and reading comprehension and no significant differences were found between treatment and control group at follow-up. Researchers hypothesize that adolescent students with LI may require additional support to achieve long-term  gains",
            "Clinician/teacher directed methods of language intervention \u2013Intervention for syntax and morphology difficulties: -Authors of a systematic review of language interventions for school-aged children (kindergarten\u201312th  grade) concluded that there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions regarding therapy targeted at syntax difficulties. Only one study reviewed investigated intervention for upper grade children or adolescents, and it did not yield significant differences between the control and treatment groups.(4) Recommendations for intervention for syntax and morphology  are based on clinical guidelines presented in case studies and descriptive studies. Grammar instruction should be linked to the curriculum -Select syntactical constructions from the text to target and have the student brainstorm syntactic variations and meanings -Explicitly teach 5\u201310  examples of a specific syntactic construction. Encourage the student to self-generate examples(38) -Show the student how to maintain a list of grammar rules in a notebook(38) -Have the student use specific syntactic forms while answering questions about a text(38) -Explicitly teach commonly used prefixes and suffixes -Authors of a qualitative review of interventions for older students with syntax difficulties outlined 4 principles of instruction in helping students to understand and use the unique grammar of expository texts:(39) -Grammatical instruction and explicit manipulation of grammatical forms should be embedded within the context of the expository discourse task (reading of curriculum materials) as well as in isolated, decontextualized metalinguistic activities -Opportunities for practice of new grammatical forms should be provided in all modalities: reading, writing, and oral language -Students should have multiple exposure to target patterns as well as repeated opportunities to practice new grammatical forms -Materials for treatment should be drawn from students\u2019 curricular materials -In a study conducted in the United States with 30 children with SLI ages 10 to 14 years, 11 months, researchers investigated the effects of once-weekly therapy (n = 14) compared to twice-weekly  therapy (n = 16) for 9 weeks. All treatment sessions were 40\u201360  minutes long and treatment focused on training the children to comprehend complex sentence structures using repetition, metalinguistic training, and guided practice. Outcome measures indicated that 80% of participants exhibited medium or large effect sizes in their ability to produce complex sentences in structured contexts. There was no significant difference in treatment gains noted between the participants who had therapy once weekly versus twice weekly(59) \u2013Intervention for semantics/vocabulary deficits: Authors of a review of language intervention studies for school-aged children in kindergarten through 12th grade reported that there is a lack of strong evidence regarding the effectiveness of vocabulary interventions but that SLPs should have some confidence in interventions that involve collaborating with classroom teachers to provide systematic vocabulary instruction.(4) V ocabulary intervention in the later grades should always be aligned with content classes. To understand increasingly difficult expository texts (texts that provide information), students have to learn specific words associated with social studies, science, mathematics, and literature(38) -Provide a rich context for students to learn new words. New vocabulary should not be encountered in isolation but in contexts that enforce the words\u2019 meaning, such as expository texts, visuals, and video clips -Collaborate with regular and special education teachers to design instruction to provide students with multiple exposures to new words. Students need opportunities to hear a new word, read it, and use it in speaking and writing. Computerized instruction can also be used to reinforce vocabulary concepts -Use semantic organizers (visual representations of how words are related to each other) to teach clusters of words and to assist students in forming links between words -Teach students independent word-learning  strategies so that they can find meanings of words they encounter in spoken or written language on their own -Introduce examples of new words to assist students in understanding the boundaries of the definition -Teach students to define words themselves. Students may work in pairs to infer the meaning of new words they encounter in texts. Begin with instruction on how to define concrete nouns and gradually move to more abstract nouns(40) -In an RCT in the United Kingdom, researchers investigated the effects of semantic therapy for word-finding  difficulties in 15 children aged 9 years, 11 months to 15 years, 11 months with persistent language impairments.(41) Participants were randomly assigned to a therapy vs. a delayed control group. Therapy involved two 15-minute  semantic therapy sessions per week for 8 weeks that targeted words from one of three semantic categories (animals, food, clothes). Activities included sorting pictures by semantic categories, discussing the semantic attributes of pictures, comparing pictures in terms of the attributes, and using these attributes and categories as cues in games (e.g., 20 questions). Dependent measures were the Test of Adolescent Word Finding (TAWF) and the Test of Word Finding in Discourse  (TWFD). Results indicated that both treatment groups had significant increases in scores on the TAWF after therapy that were maintained 5 months later; the control group did not have an increase on the TAWF. Neither group made significant gains on the TWFD -In a study in the United Kingdom, researchers investigated the relative effects of a vocabulary intervention and a narrative intervention on the language and reading abilities of 54 adolescents (mean age 12 years, 8 months) with severe and complex difficulties in language and communication.(42) Participants were randomly assigned to a vocabulary intervention group or a narrative intervention group. Each group received intervention in two 50-minute  sessions per week for 6 weeks -Narrative intervention: Targeted the understanding and telling of stories with a focus on story structure, story description, and inferential understanding -V ocabulary intervention: Key concepts of vocabulary were taught through mind-mapping,  word associations, and word building. Specific concepts from the National Curriculum were targeted -Pretest language and reading measures indicated no significant difference between the two treatment groups. At posttest, both groups showed significant improvements on measures of receptive vocabulary, recalling sentences, and nonliteral comprehension. Differences between groups on other measures did not reach significance(42) \u2013Interventions for pragmatic deficits: Authors of a systematic review of language interventions for school-aged  children in kindergarten through 12th grade did not identify any intervention studies for pragmatic deficits of children in the upper grades.(4) Pragmatic targets might include telling narratives, describing past events, asking questions, requesting help, interpreting people's emotions, taking another's perspective, maintaining topic, monitoring one's own conversational contributions, and interacting with peers. Activities to address these targets might include:(43) -Stories can be used to discuss the characters' actions and intentions to target specific social discourse goals -Story structure can be illustrated by examples as well as explicit instruction on narrative components (e.g., introduction, setting, characters). Cue cards with the components can be used to prompt children as they tell or retell narratives -Video of social interactions can be used to discuss and evaluate others' social discourse -Role-plays  can be used to practice social discourse goals -Multiple opportunities should be provided to use behaviors in different contexts to allow for generalization \u2013Intervention for receptive language/auditory comprehension -In a study conducted in the United Kingdom with 72 children ages 9 to 17 years, researchers investigated the effectiveness of individual therapy sessions targeting individualized receptive and expressive language deficits (as well as some articulation and phonological awareness deficits). Researchers selected targets as well as control measures and found significant improvement on the targets after intervention (30% improvement on targets versus 8% improvement on controls). Researchers concluded that individualized, individual speech therapy for older children with SLI is effective(64) -In an RCT conducted in the United Kingdom with 14 adolescents with severe receptive LI, researchers reported significant gains in comprehension of coordinating conjunctions after 4 hours of individual shape coding therapy(53) -In Phase 1 of the trial, the therapy group received eight 30-minute individual sessions of shape coding therapy (explicit teaching with visual support) along with their usual speech therapy sessions. In Phase 2, the waiting control group received the same therapy protocol(53) -Therapy sessions consisted of introduction to coordinating conjunctions and explicit teaching of their meaning through spoken explanations and visual supports (i.e., the subject is circled, the auxiliary has a diamond written around it, the verb phrase is marked with a hexagon, and the adjective phrase has a cloud drawn around it)(53) -Coordinating conjunctions were introduced one at a time in a variety of sentences, and each step built on the previous step; the SLP did not move on to the next target conjunction until good comprehension was achieved (exact percentage of accuracy was not reported)(53) -At the conclusion of the 4 hours of individual therapy, subjects\u2019 language skills were reassessed; significant improvement in comprehension of coordinating conjunctions was observed for the therapy group as compared to the waiting controls. After the waiting control group completed the therapy, their scores were significantly higher as well. Additionally, researchers combined results of phase 1 and 2 and found a significant effect overall. These gains were maintained at a 4-month  follow-up  as well(53) \u2013Interventions for comprehension/text comprehension: Comprehension instruction in the later grades usually is associated with comprehension of specific texts. The following are techniques to assist students with comprehension in content area classes:  -Activate the student's prior knowledge: Discuss the text with the student prior to reading it to elicit background knowledge about the subject matter. Students can also be guided to read previews, summaries, or section headings before reading the text(38) -Assist the student to engage in active learning: Instruct the student how to use different materials such as quizzes, notes, alternative texts, personal summaries, or online resources to reinforce knowledge. Students with LI do not always study in an efficient way and need to be taught a script for reviewing material(38) -Target useful vocabulary: Target words for the student to learn should be identified in the text. The student can practice using vocabulary by answering questions about the text, retelling parts of the text using target words, making definitions with the words, or using target words in sentence generation. See above for more information on vocabulary instruction(38) -Facilitate strategy use: The SLP can assist the student in using different comprehension strategies. The following are some strategies that the student can use while reading text. All strategies should be explicitly taught and modeled by the SLP or teacher:(44,45,46) -Graphic and semantic organizers: Readers make visual or graphic representations of what they read -Question answering: The teacher/SLP poses questions before, during, or after reading -Question generation: Students are taught to ask themselves questions about what they read -Story structure: Students are taught to use story mapping to help them recall the details and parts of a story -Summarization: After reading a text, students are asked to summarize (orally or by writing) what they have just read",
            "Computer-based  intervention/training in rapid auditory processing: Fast ForWord (FFW) is a computer program designed to improve a child's detection of rapidly presented and changing speech stimuli. The program is based on the hypothesis that children's reading and language deficits are due to a general auditory processing deficit(47) \u2013The effectiveness of FFW for improving reading and language abilities for 2nd-and 7th-grade  students at risk for language and reading difficulties was examined in an RCT conducted in 8 schools (N = 274 7th-grade  students) in the United States.(47) Participants in the treatment group received supplemental instruction with FFW (100 min/day, 5 days a week for 4 to 8 weeks). The control group received no additional intervention. The 7th-grade  students used a middle school version of the software that had graphics and content tailored to their age and grade levels. The authors concluded that FFW did not help the students improve their language and reading comprehension scores on a standardized achievement test .
