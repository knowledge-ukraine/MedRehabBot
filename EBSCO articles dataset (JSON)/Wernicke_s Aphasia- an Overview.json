In the first part of the study, participants included 16 patients with aphasia (various subtypes) and 15 neurologically intact age-matched  adults. Researchers found that the patients with aphasia had a reduced ability to discriminate between two rhythmic patterns, greater variability when tapping along with a rhythm, and reduced accuracy in tapping a rhythm from memory as compared to the control adults. As a group, the patients with aphasia had poorer rhythm processing than the control adults; however, not all patients with aphasia displayed rhythm processing deficits. In part two of the study, participants included 14 patients with aphasia (various types) and 16 neurologically intact age-matched  adults. Researchers compared the auditory discrimination ability (for pitch and rhythm of both speech and tones) between the two groups and found that the group with aphasia performed worse than the control group overall. Detailed analysis of the data showed that the group with aphasia had a relative difficulty with rhythm processing versus pitch processing.(117) If the treating SLP is planning to use tapping strategies or rhythmic patterns as part of aphasia therapy (e.g., compensatory strategies for apraxia, melodic intonation therapy), rhythm processing should be assessed before creating the plan of care",

Also, group therapy may provide support for the patient, provide information about aphasia, and increase the patient\u2019s confidence in communicative situations -The effects of group therapy on participants with chronic aphasia were investigated in an RCT conducted in the United States with two groups, immediate treatment and delayed treatment(31) -An SLP provided group therapy for 5 hours/week (2.5 hour periods/2 days a week) for 4 months. The control group participated in social activities (support, performance, movement groups) to control for the effects of social interaction. The first part of group therapy involved discussions of interest for the patients. Information exchange was facilitated by communicative drawing, role-playing,  natural gestures, maps, pictures, personal notebooks, conversational prompting, and scripting. A break for refreshments included family members. The last part of the group session was spent wrapping up the initial discussion or talking about news events -Dependent measures included standardized tests: WAB AQ, CADL, SPICA. Results indicated that the immediate treatment group had significantly higher scores on the measures compared to the group not receiving treatment. Within-group  performance revealed significant increases after 2 months of treatment and after 4 months of treatment. No significant decline occurred 1 month post-treatment(31) -In a small study conducted in the United States with 5 patients with aphasia, both fluent and nonfluent subtypes, researchers found significantly greater improved communication on the Aphasia Diagnostic Profile\u2019s Alternative Communication subtest following 2 individual sessions and 6 sessions of group therapy when compared with a control group of 5 patients who received 8 individual sessions of speech therapy(77) \u2013Supported conversation/conversation partner training -In a single-blind  RCT conducted in Canada, researchers investigated the effects of training of volunteers (N = 40) on the conversational interaction of patients with aphasia(56) -Training included a 1-day  workshop and 1.5 hours of hands-on  experience to teach volunteers topics such as keeping the talk natural and avoiding being patronizing. They were also taught to ensure comprehension of the patient and use techniques such as gesturing, drawing, pictographic resources, and writing keywords -Measures were researcher-developed  and designed to assess the skill of the conversational partner in \u201cacknowledging and revealing the competence of adults with aphasia.\u201d Another researcher-developed measure assessed the level of interaction of the patient -Trained volunteers scored higher than untrained volunteers on ratings of acknowledging competence and revealing competence. Persons with aphasia showed a change in social and message exchange skills(56) -An intervention study conducted in Denmark with 31 nurses supported the use of direct training of Supported Conversation for Adults with aphasia (SCA) for improving communication between nursing staff and patients with aphasia(75) \u2013Promoting Aphasic\u2019s Communicative Awareness (PACE) has been described as a functional therapy approach that promotes more realistic conversations to assist patients with aphasia to improve their communicative skills.(27) Some features of PACE include a free choice of communicative modality (gesture, speech), equal opportunity for the patient and the therapist to send and receive messages, the use of novel (rather than known) information, and natural feedback used to figure out the sender\u2019s message. The patient and therapist take turns communicating the content represented on a picture  card. Picture cards are drawn from a stack so that only the \u201cmessage sender\" knows the content (novel information). The turn ends when the message is conveyed successfully. The clinician\u2019s role is to model effective communicative behaviors that are within the patient\u2019s capacity and to give the patient opportunities for successful communication. Other conversational partners (spouse) can take part in therapy to learn strategies -Although several treatment studies have examined the efficacy of PACE, the evidence is mixed due to methodological reasons (e.g., use of a modified version of PACE, comparison with an unequal type of treatment, lack of control of other factors influencing recovery)(20,27) \u2013Semantic Feature Analysis (SFA) therapy for naming impairments(132) -A treatment for naming deficits in patients with aphasia -The patient is presented with a target picture in the center of a chart and asked to name it; regardless of whether or not the patient can name the picture, he or she is then asked to identify semantic features of the target item such as: -What does it look like? -How is it used? Why is it used? -To which category does it belong? -What are other items associated with it? -What is an opposite item/concept? -SFA can help in training people to self-cue  for word-finding  strategies when they encounter word-finding  deficits in real life situations -Authors of a systematic literature review of SFA, the found that SFA is an effective treatment for people with aphasia. There were 21 studies included in the review with 55 total subjects,and the results indicated that the treatment was effective despite having a variety of methodologies and variations to the treatment protocol(132) \u2013Phonological Components Analysis (PCA) treatment for naming impairments(72) -A treatment for naming deficits in patients with aphasia; modeled on the framework of SFA therapy(72) -The patient is presented with a target picture in the center of a chart and asked to name it; regardless of whether or not the patient can name the picture, he or she is then asked to identify five phonological aspects about the target item(72): -What does this rhyme with? -What sound does it start with? -What other word starts with the same sound? -What sound does it end with? -How many beats (syllables) does the word have? -In a single-subject,  multiple baseline study conducted in Australia with 10 participants with various types of aphasia (Broca\u2019s, mixed, anomic, nonfluent, Wernicke\u2019s), each participant took part in PCA sessions 3 times per week for 1 hour for a maximum of 15 sessions(72) -According to outcome measures, 7 out of 10 participants improved in naming ability; these naming improvements were maintained on follow-up measures 4 weeks after treatment concluded(72) -Generalization to untreated items was observed for 3 of the 7 improved patients(72) \u2013Picture-naming  therapy(22) -Preliminary evidence suggests that picture-naming therapy (for both nouns and verbs) in patients with various subtypes of aphasia can be generalize to improved connected speech(22) -In a study conducted in the United Kingdom involving 7 patients with various subtypes and severity of aphasia, researchers found that after 5 weeks, 2 sessions per week, confrontation naming ability improved in all participants; additionally, some participants showed improved verbal output for picture-supported  narratives; the least amount of improvement was found on spontaneous/unsupportive narrative generation(22) \u2013Bilingual patients with aphasia: For bilingual patients with aphasia, there is preliminary evidence that treatment in the nondominant language may better facilitate cross-linguistic generalization than treatment in the dominant language(29) -For detailed information on the assessment and treatment of bilingual adults with aphasia, see Clinical Review\u2026 Language Disorders: Aphasia in Bilingual Adults , referenced above \u2013AAC -An AAC needs assessment must be performed to determine the patient\u2019s ability to use AAC and to identify the most appropriate type of AAC(14)  -AAC options include picture boards, symbol sets, paper tablets, communication notebooks with customized phrases, remnant books, photographs, written words, alphabet cards (for self-cueing),  and voice output devices(14) -For detailed information on the assessment and treatment for AAC with patients with aphasia, see Clinical Review\u2026 Augmentative and Alternative Communication: Aphasia , referenced above \u2013Adjunct brain stimulation -Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)(126) -Involves constant, low-intensity  current being passed through two electrodes placed on the head. There are two types of stimulation with tDCS: anodal stimulation and cathodal stimulation. Anodal stimulation is used to excite neuronal activity, and cathodal stimulation inhibits or reduces neuronal activity(126) -Authors of a Cochrane systematic review including 12 clinical trials that compared tDCS to sham tDCS as an adjunct to speech therapy reported low-quality  evidence and concluded that there is no evidence to support the effectiveness of any tDCS in improving the outcomes of speech therapy in patients with aphasia following stroke(126) -Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS): rTMS allows for painless, noninvasive stimulation of the brain with low-frequency  magnetic fields to create electrical currents in specific regions of the brain(45,78) -Applying rTMS to a specific part of the brain in the undamaged hemisphere can suppress the inhibitory process of that area and allow for the reactivation of some areas within the damaged hemisphere, thereby promoting functional recovery(78) -In several small research studies, combining rTMS with traditional speech therapy has been associated with significantly greater improvement in language recovery compared to speech therapy alone.(45,78,125) Although showing initial promise in research studies, rTMS is in the early stages of the investigation and is not widely available for clinical use as a treatment for aphasia",
            "Treatment approaches targeting specific subtypes of aphasia \u2013Broca\u2019s aphasia -Linguistic treatment(8) -Treatment of Underlying Forms (TUF) is a meta-linguistic  therapy approach found to increase verbal production of grammatically intact sentences in patients with agrammatic aphasia(105,106) -Constraint-Induced  Aphasia Therapy (CIAT) is based on the principles of Constraint-Induced  Movement Therapy (CIMT) for motor rehabilitation following stroke(89,104) -Principles of CIAT include: -Constraint: not allowing the patient to use compensatory strategies for communication (e.g., drawing, writing, gesturing)(104) -Forced use: forcing the use of speech during communicative exchanges(104) -Massed practice: participating in therapy in high, concentrated doses (such as 2 to 4 hours per day, 4 to 5 days per week)(89,104) -For detailed information on CIAT, see Clinical Review\u2026Aphasia: Constraint-Induced  Language Therapy ; Number: T902529 -Melodic Intonation Therapy (MIT): MIT involves a hierarchically structured treatment program that focuses on practice in speaking with exaggerated prosody.(12,52) For detailed information on MIT, see Clinical Review\u2026Aphasia, Broca's (Nonfluent Aphasia) , referenced above -Functional communication training -Reduced Syntax Therapy (REST): Therapy that focuses on training German-  and English-speaking patients with agrammatic aphasia to produce simple utterances with a reduced syntactic structure; also referred to as elliptical style (such as \u201cI\u2026pill\u201d or \u201cman\u2026angry\u201d)(97) -For detailed information on the treatment for Broca\u2019s aphasia, see Clinical Review\u2026Aphasia, Broca\u2019 s (Nonfluent Aphasia) , referenced above \u2013Wernicke\u2019s aphasia -CIAT(68,89) -Therapy to decrease perseveration; increasing naming ability(9) -Therapy for short-term  memory (e.g., recalling sentences of increasing length)(33,65)  -Situational therapy with a gesture: Situational therapy consists of training the patient to use gesture and other means of nonverbal communication in daily situations (e.g., going to the grocery store)(1) -For detailed information on the treatment for Wernicke\u2019s aphasia, see Clinical Review\u2026Aphasia, Wernicke\u2019 s (Receptive Aphasia, Fluent Aphasia) , referenced above \u2013Global aphasia -Computer-based  Visual Input Communication (C-VIC): The C-VIC  sentence production training program is a computer-based  program that involves learning a specific iconic vocabulary to produce sentences/phrases for communication(82) -AAC(49,54) -For detailed information on the treatment for global aphasia, see Clinical Review\u2026Aphasia, Global , referenced above \u2013Anomic aphasia -SFA(15,62,110) -Complexity Account of Treatment Efficacy (CATE): A semantically based approach in which training of words proceeds from complex to simple items (e.g., atypical to typical: ostrich vs. robin)(61,62,63) -Phonemic cues to facilitate oral naming(28,44,59,95,109) -Patients with anomic aphasia are better able to produce a word after hearing the initial phoneme; the goal of this approach is for the patient to eventually self-generate  phonemic cues -Spaced Retrieval (SR): A memory intervention designed to facilitate recall of words over progressively longer intervals of time(37) -For detailed information on the treatment for anomic aphasia, see Clinical Review\u2026Anomia Associated with Aphasia , referenced above \u2013Transcortical motor aphasia -Movement training to increase verbal initiations(92) -For detailed information on the treatment for transcortical motor aphasia, see Clinical Review\u2026Aphasia, Transcortical Motor , referenced above \u2013Transcortical sensory aphasia -For detailed information on the treatment for transcortical sensory aphasia, see Clinical Review\u2026Aphasia, Transcortical Sensory , referenced above \u2013Conduction aphasia -Case studies have described treatments to improve cognitive, rather than language, skills (e.g., attention, memory) in patients with conduction aphasia; however, there is little evidence that treatment generalizes to functional communication and untrained functions(65,86) -Therapy to improve verbal repetition(66) -Self-monitoring  and speech production therapy(23,34) -For detailed information on the treatment for conduction aphasia, see Clinical Review\u2026Aphasia, Conduction , referenced above .
