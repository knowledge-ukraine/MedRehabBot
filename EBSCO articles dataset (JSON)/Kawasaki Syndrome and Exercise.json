            "Kawasaki disease (KD) is a rare pediatric systemic vasculitis that involvesthe coronary arteries and other medium-sized arteries.Formerly called mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome, it is characterized in the acute phase by erythema of the lips and oral mucosa, cervical lymphadenopathy, and bilateral eye redness (nonexudative conjunctivitis). KD typically develops after a short fever (about 10 days) with a rash of unknown etiology(1)",
            "KD is the leading cause of acquired pediatric heart disease in North America, Japan, and Europe. The prevalence of KD is highest in countries that are rapidly becoming industrialized, such as China and India(21,22)",
            "Patients often have Asian ethnicity and are under 5 years of age. The incidence of KD is highest at 243.1 to 264.8 (per 100,000) in the Japanese population, 50.4 among other Asians and Pacific Islanders, 29.8 among black Americans, 22.5 in white Californians, and 8.39 in the United Kingdom(22)",
            "The exact pathogenesis of KD remains unclear. However, the cause is associated with dysregulated inflammatory immune responses,such as increased interleukin (IL)-6 production in response to various viruses or microbes. KD shares clinical features of toxic shock syndrome and Covid-19  symptoms in children (28,29,30)",
            "The acute phase of KD is routinely treated with intravenous immunoglobulin therapy (IVIg).Of children who are not treated with IVIg, 15% to 25% acquire multiple coronary aneurysms that can contribute to ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, or sudden death. (1,2,7,32) KD is the most common cause of acquired heart disease in the developed world.(1,32) The long-term cardiac sequelae of KD canremain undiagnosed for years. For example, the mean age at presentation was 24.7 +/- 8.4 years (range, 12 to 39 years) in 74 persons with serious KD-related  cardiac symptoms(3)",
            "In persons with a history of KD, large-diameter  coronary aneurysms are associated with reduced peak exercise capacity. (24,27) Although active KD is almost unheard of in adults,persons with a past history of KDwho present for physical training require special consideration due to increased risk of underlying coronary artery disease (CAD) (32) Exercise-inducible  myocardial ischemia is common in the subset of post-KD  patients with persistent coronary artery aneurysms and/or stenosis (4,5) Children and adults with a history of KD shouldbe screened for exercise-inducible coronary artery insufficiency prior  to vigorous exercise training, even though most patients report being asymptomatic during voluntary moderate physical activity (1,5,32)",
            "CADdoes not exclude KD patients from engaging in vigorous recreational activities for promotion of health and fitness. However, screening for exercise-inducible  cardiac symptoms is highly recommended to ensure the safety of vigorous exercise (4,12,24,27)"
