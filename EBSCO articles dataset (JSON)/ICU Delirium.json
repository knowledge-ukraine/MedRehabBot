            "Delirium is classified in DSM-5  as a neurocognitive disorder of global brain failure characterized by acute disturbances in attention, awareness, and cognition that vary in severity over time.(1) Deficits can occur in memory, visual-spatialorientation, language, and perception. Additional psychomotor disturbances occur in three subtypes: hyperactive, hypoactive, or mixed state",
            "Patients with delirium may fluctuate between states of hyperactivity and hypoactivity(1,2,27) \u2013Hyperactive state is more common and often is associated with medication side effects and drug withdrawal -Sometimes called \u201cICU psychosis\u201d(2) \u2013Hypoactive state is more frequent in older adults -Sometimes called \u201cquiet delirium\u201d(2) \u2013Mixed states: hyper-  and hypoactive states fluctuate",
            "ICU delirium is associated with disturbances in the sleep-wake  cycle (e.g., daytime sleepiness, nighttime agitation, reversal of night-day  sleep cycle)(1,27)",
            "Patients with delirium may also exhibit emotional disturbances (e.g., anxiety, fear, depression, irritability, anger, euphoria, apathy)(1,27) \u2013Emotional statesmay shift rapidly \u2013Emotional states are characterized by calling out, screaming, cursing, muttering, moaning, or other sounds \u2013Emotional disturbances occurmore commonly at night and under conditions when stimulation and environmental cues are lacking",
            "ICU delirium is an independent predictor of mortality and morbidity and is associated with prolonged hospital and ICU stays(3)",
            "In acute care centers, the incidence of delirium can be as high as 87% among patients with psychiatric syndromes(27)",
            "Critically ill patients in the ICU are routinely monitored for delirium using the American College of Critical Care Medicine (ACCCM)/Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) clinical practice guidelines for pain, agitation, and delirium (PAD)(4)",
            "Patient management of delirium in the ICU often follows the ABCDEF bundle developed by SCCM. It consists of the following:(5) \u2013A \u2013 Assess,prevent, manage pain  \u2013B \u2013 Both spontaneous awakening trials and spontaneous breathing trials \u2013C \u2013 Choice of analgesia and sedation \u2013D \u2013 Delirium: Assess, prevent, manage \u2013E \u2013 Early mobility and exercise \u2013F \u2013 Family engagement and empowerment -Authors of a cohort study found that use of the ABCDE (F was added to the bundle after the study started) for patient management over 18 months increased the number of days of breathing without assistance, reduced delirium onset by about 50%, and permitted greatermobilization than in patients treated with usual care(6)",
            "About 2 of 3 patients in the ICU develop delirium and 7 of 10 patients on ventilators in the ICU develop delirium(7)",
            "The prevalence of delirium diagnosed in patients admitted to hospital ranges from 14% to 24%, while the incidence of delirium arising during hospitalization ranges from 6% to 56%(1) \u2013Delirium occurs in 15% to 53% of older adults postoperatively and in 70% to 87% of older adults in the ICU \u2013Authors of a 2018 systematic review conducted in the Netherlands found an incidence rate of delirium in older ICU patients of 29%(33)",
            "Twenty-five  percent of children in the cardiac ICU develop delirium(35)",
            "The nonpharmacological approach to management of ICU delirium involves restoration of senses, early mobilization, physiotherapy, improvement in sleep hygiene and family involvement(8)",

However, walking ability improved and the risk of ICU-acquired  weakness was reduced compared to usual care(17) -The authors acknowledged that their results differed from previous reviews and attributed differences to their inclusion of mobilization in usual care -Usual care was defined as encompassing passive ROM, position change every 2 hours while the patient was unconscious and once he or she regained consciousness, increasing the level of activity (first in an active-assisted  way with exercise in bed, progressing to sitting on the edge of bed, then transition from sitting to standing to finally reach ambulation [assisted or independent]) -In order to be considered rehabilitation, the intervention needed to include more components than usual care, be performed at a higher dose (intensity, volume, or frequency), or started at an earlier point than usual care \u2013Authors of an RCT (N = 308 patients  who had received at least 48 hours of invasive or non-invasive  ventilation in the ICU) in the United Kingdom.
