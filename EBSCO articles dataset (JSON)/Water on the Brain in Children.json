The system is designed to divert the flow of CSF from the CNS to another area of the body where it can be absorbed as part of the normal circulatory process.(2) The surgical approach may be described as posterior or frontal, referring to the area of the brain the proximal catheter must pass to reach the ventricles A shunt system is composed of a shunt (flexible tube), ventricular catheter, flush pump, valve, and distal catheter. The valve, located along the catheter, maintains a oneway  flow and regulates the rate of CSF flow. The valves are designed to open at a predetermined intraventricular pressure and close when the pressure falls below that level, preventing fluid backflow(2)  Shunt typesan internal shunt that transports excess CSF from one lateral ventricle to the right atrium. Due to increased risk of septicemia, ventriculitis, superior vena cava occlusion, and pulmonary emboli, the V A shunt is not used as commonly as others(1)an internal shunt that transports excess CSF from the lateral ventricle directly into the peritoneum, where it can be reabsorbed and the excess excreted. It is the preferred method for shunt placement. There is a greater risk for shunt occlusion; however, the complications are much less severe compared to a V A shunt(1)an internal shunt that transports excess CSF from the subarachnoid space to the peritoneum. Typically used for patients who have a pathology that obstructs CSF flow. The advantages compared to VP or V A shunts are the avoidance of brain penetrance, large CSF space in the thecal sac, and potential for large amount of CSF drainage.(16) It is more commonly used for adults but may be used in children as an alternative to a VP shunt for the management of communicating hydrocephalus(16) In a 2019 retrospective study conducted in Taiwan, researchers concluded there was a lower complication rate associated with LP shunt compared to VP shunt (1% and 13.5%, respectively). The overall revision rate due to shunt malfunction was 7.3% in both groups(16) A reservoir placement may be appropriate to siphon excess CSF for a period of time into a superficial well that can be emptied by needle aspiration. Reservoir placements may be used to assess the need for a shunt and the specific type of shunt that would be best suited for a child(1) External shunt placement  common in inpatient settings following surgery or during treatment of a shunt infection Please see  Overall Contraindications/Precautions  , above, for shunt complications ETV  alternative procedure to a shunt system for managing hydrocephalus(2) A tiny opening is surgically created in the floor of the 3rd ventricle with the use of a neuroendoscope, allowing CSF to bypass the obstruction and recirculate toward the site of reabsorption around the brain\u2019s surface(2) ETV  indications(9) The ideal patient for this procedure has a diagnosis of noncommunicating hydrocephalus with the obstruction located at the aqueduct of Sylvius ETV may be appropriate for other patients, including those with spina bifida or Arnold-Chiari malformation; however, this decision must be carefully weighed by the physician and depends on unique patient circumstances Children presenting with shunt malfunction may be better served with ETV instead of shunt revision When ETV was first introduced, it was considered, in contrast to shunts, to be minimally invasive and effective for treating hydrocephalus.
