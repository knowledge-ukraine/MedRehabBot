Numerous intrinsic factors (e.g., orthopedic problems, poor balance, restricted mobility, peripheral neuropathy, depression symptoms, cognitive impairment), as well as extrinsic factors (e.g., environmental/situational hazards, certain medications), may contribute to postural instability and increase the risk of accidental falls",
            "In community-dwelling  older adults, falls typically occur during regular activity and involve outdoor or indoor situational hazards (e.g., stumbling on uneven ground, tripping on home obstacle or sidewalk curb, slipping on wet surface, using stairs or escalator, entering or exiting a vehicle).(2) Modification of fall risk factors in the physical environment likely helps to prevent older adults from falling",
            "In nursing home residents, falls may involve situational hazards (e.g., a loose rug or object on the floor), but are more often associated with an uncontrolled transfer from bed to chair or chair to standing, or a lack of grab bars/assistive devices.(3) Restricted mobility is thus an intrinsic fall risk factor. Physical restraints (lap belts, geriatric chair) may be required to prevent falls in older adults in assisted-living  facilities, but these should always be used according to state laws and/or hospital policy and directly supervised",
