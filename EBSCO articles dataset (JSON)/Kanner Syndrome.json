According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5 ), which was published in 2013, ASD encompasses the following diagnoses that were previously classified as PDD:(57) \u2013Autism \u2013Asperger syndrome (or Asperger\u2019s disorder) \u2013Pervasive developmental disorder\u2013not  otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) \u2013Childhood disintegrative disorder",

            "In an Australian study of 210 individuals who met DSM-IV  criteria for autistic disorder, only 57.1% met DSM-5  criteria for ASD diagnosis. High-functioning  individuals were less likely to meet the DSM-5  criteria for ASD, with the most common reason for exclusion being a failure to satisfy all three criteria in the social-communication domain(81)",
            "Most studies suggest that 50\u201375%  of patients in whom ASD was diagnosed according to the DSM-IV  criteria continue to meet criteria under the DSM-5   (105)",

            "The worldwide prevalence is about 1%(92) \u2013Prevalence is reported to be increasing at an estimated rate of 10-17%  annually(57)",
