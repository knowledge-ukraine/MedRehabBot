            "Pierre Robin sequence (PRS) refers to a congenital condition characterized by the following triad: micrognathia (undersized jaw), glossoptosis (abnormal back or downward placement of the tongue), and U-shaped  cleft of the palate (an opening in the roof of the mouth)(1,30)",
            "PRS can occur in isolation without any other abnormality (known as isolated or nonsyndromic PRS) or as part of a syndrome such as Stickler syndrome, velocardiofacial syndrome, fetal alcohol syndrome, 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, or Treacher Collins syndrome(1,34)",
            "PRS was originally classified as a syndrome, but in 1982 it was reclassified as a sequence because the associated anomalies are due to a primary etiology, unlike a syndrome, in which all anomalies have a single etiology.(30) The micrognathia is the primary anomaly and leads to the cleft palate and the glossoptosis during development(30)",
            "Feeding difficulties in infants with PRS are attributed to cleft palate, micrognathia, and glossoptosisas well as neurological disorders associated with accompanying syndromes that can affect feeding and swallowing ability(6,32)"

            "Feeding issues for children with PRS vary from minimal to severe. The success of oral feeding has been found to be related to the presence of another syndrome and the severity of airway issues(1) \u2013Characteristics of PRS associated with feeding difficulties -Infants with cleft palate have difficulty generating sufficient intraoral negative pressure for efficient sucking during feeding due to the opening between the oral and  nasal cavities. The hard and soft palates provide no support or seal for the tongue to act against when sucking and attempting to extract milk(4,30,38) -Mandibular hypoplasia results in abnormal muscular attachments to the tongue. The abnormal muscular attachments cause the tongue to rest in a superior and posterior position in the oropharynx, which can obstruct the airway and respiratory functioning.(30,48) Additionally, tongue displacement also typically results in impaired coordination of sucking and swallowing in infants with PRS(30) -Glossoptosis impairs anteriorization of the tongue, which is necessary to obtain adequate suction(30) -Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is also prevalent in PRS and can lead to reflux laryngitis, which can worsen any airway obstruction and compromise swallowing mechanisms(39,46)",
            "Consequences associated with poor feeding ability include: \u2013failure to thrive(4,30) \u2013breastfeeding malnutrition(4) \u2013nasal regurgitation of food(30,38) \u2013excessive air intake requiring frequent burping(30) \u2013choking(30) \u2013aspiration pneumonia(38) \u2013increased morbidity(4)",

Airway obstruction commonly improves with time as the mandible grows; however, for some infants with PRS, airway obstruction is progressive, necessitating regular airway evaluations during the first few months of life(39) \u2013Speech impairments(30) \u2013Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)(45) \u2013Hearing impairments/loss(32) \u2013Vision impairments -When PRS occurs in association with Stickler syndrome, retinal detachment and blindness can occur(46) Causes, Pathogenesis, & Risk Factors"

Thepalatal shelves are blocked by the tongue from moving toward the midline and fusing. Thus, a U-shaped  palatal cleft isformed(30,31)",
            "Mandibular hypoplasia arising before 9 weeks of fetal life can be the result of a malformation (e.g., Treacher Collinssyndrome), a disruption (e.g., amniotic band), or deformation (e.g., oligohydramnios)(33)"

Scales, surveys, and checklists are commonly used in the BSE but often do not include normative data, standardization, validation, or guidelines for interpretation, particularly for infants with cleft palate. SLP knowledge of normal oral motor development and feeding function are essential when evaluating infants(8)Evaluation of an infant\u2019s ability to suck on a bottle or breast. Includes assessment of infant\u2019s feeding history, oral motor skills, oral tactile responses, suck-swallow-breath coordination, general motor control, and general physical state during feeding and swallowing(17)Evaluation of an infant\u2019s sucking ability (up to 3 months of age). Aspects of sucking behavior are classified as normal, disorganized, or dysfunctional(18)Rating scale that examines swallowing and voice in infants up to 2 years of age. Ratings include duration of the meal, amount of intake, food consistencies, positioning, sucking from a nipple, sipping from a cup, and coordination of suck-swallow-breath(19)Lip, cheek, tongue, and jaw movements are rated during a typical meal. This scale can be used with infants from 1 year of age through adulthood(20)A statistically based protocol for patients who are dependent feeders. Scaled ratings are made for posture, tone, reflexes, general motor control, orofacial structures, orofacial sensory input, orofacial motor control, ventilation, and functional feeding assessment(21)Ratings of lip, jaw, and tongue movement during ingestion of liquids and solid foods. Assessment of sipping from a cup, coughing, gagging, and hypersensitivity associated with feeding and swallowing. A checklist allows for indication of abnormal oral structures, oral reflexes, positioning, diet, utensils, and feeding(22)A VFSS is performed when the dysphagia team has concerns about the pharyngeal phase of swallowing and the complete swallowing sequence.  A VFSS is completed in collaboration with a radiologist or physiatrist. Most clinical practices follow the protocol originally described by Logemann(42) and adaptations of this protocol for infants and children described by Arvedson and Lefton-Greif.(41) The assessment must be age appropriate with regard to positioning, presentation, and viscosity of material.(23) The patient eats and drinks a variety of developmentally appropriate liquids and solids mixed with barium while images are recorded with videofluorography. The SLP examines for the presence of aspiration and the effectiveness of presenting different food consistencies or of modifying posture.(39) In contrast to the BSE, a VFSS provides critical information on the pharyngeal phase of the swallow. Due to the potential harmful effects of ionizing radiation on children, a repeat VFSS should be considered only when there are specific questions that require answers from another study; a VFSS should not be used to routinely monitor changes in swallowing.(41) During the VFSS, the following physiologic -Lip closure (ability to contain a liquid bolus) -Lingual elevation (the back of the tongue is slightly elevated) -Tongue-to-palatal  seal -Bolus preparation/mastication (as developmentally appropriate) -Bolus transport/movement of the tongue (movement of the bolus to the back of the oral cavity) -Initiation of the pharyngeal swallow (swallow should be initiated when the bolus reaches the region of the posterior oral cavity) -Soft palate elevation and retraction -Laryngeal elevation -Anterior hyoid excursion -Laryngeal closure -Pharyngeal contraction -Pharyngoesophageal segment opening -Tongue base retraction -Epiglottic inversion -Esophageal clearanceModified Barium SwallowT709077FEES is performed to evaluate the anatomy and physiology of the pharynx and the larynx, pharyngeal swallow function, and the patient\u2019s ability to manage secretions and swallow foods and liquids.(23) In addition, it can be used to explore a variety of diagnostic interventions, such as varying bolus consistency, varying posture, or making use of visual feedback for reinforcement.(43) After the insertion of the endoscope, the patient can engage in normal feeding behavior during the evaluation. Food must be light in color to enhance visibility (e.g., milk, puddings, yogurt, bread). FEES is preferred over VFSS when patients have safety issues related to radiation exposure or when they need retesting. Due to the invasive nature of the procedure, it might be difficult to obtain accurate representation of a normal swallow in young children.

        "referral to other disciplines": "Feeding assessment and treatment is best performed using a multidisciplinary team approach.(38) The following persons often are involved in the multidisciplinary management of infants with PRS: otolaryngologist, parents, SLP, nurse, lactation consultant, early childhood nurse, dietitian (nutritionist), OT, cardiopulmonologist, audiologist, pediatrician, dentist, pediatric oral surgeon, geneticist, anesthesiologist, psychologist, prosthodontist, and pediatric maxillofacial surgeon.(15,38) A physical therapy referral is needed if the infant presents with signs and symptoms of congenital muscular torticollis or deformational plagiocephaly",
        "other considerations": [],
        "treatment summary": [
            "Maternal advice and support:  Authors of a review of research on feeding interventions for infants with cleft palate found evidence that parent counseling (e.g., feeding technique instruction, lactation support, nutrition counseling) is associated with better outcomes, such as increased infant weight gain.(4) Consult with a lactation specialist to assist with breastfeeding counseling. Aspects of counseling might include advice on positioning, bottle use and type, feed duration, infant feeding cues, and breastfeeding techniques. Many mothers might not be able to breastfeed their infants, and the cleft palate team must be sensitive to the feelings of the mother about the inability to breastfeed. Some principles for feeding specific for an infant with cleft palate include: \u2013During or after feeding, the infant may sneeze or cough because of fluid in the nasal passages. Nasal regurgitation is not dangerous and sneezing and coughing allow the infant to clear the nasal passages(15) \u2013An infant with cleft palate might need to be burped more often because of air that is ingested while feeding(15) \u2013Holding the infant in a more upright position will help to prevent nasal regurgitation(15)",
            "Modified bottles and/or teats:  Some specialized bottles and teats can allow the feeder to assist with fluid flow during feeding for infants with cleft palate. For infants with micrognathia, a longer nipple usually is preferred to allow placement of the nipple in the middle part of the tongue:(27) \u2013Compressible bottles allow the milk flow to be controlled by the feeder. One example of this type of bottle is the Enfamil Cleft Palate Nurser by Mead Johnson.(15) The bottle should be squeezed in a pulsing manner in rhythm with the baby\u2019s sucking rhythm (squeeze when the infant is sucking).(15) These have been used by infants who are unable to generate suction to exact fluid independently(4) -Authors of a systematic review of feeding interventions for infants with cleft lip, cleft palate, or cleft lip and palate excluding infants with PRS examined the results of 2 studies that compared the use of squeezable versus rigid feeding bottles for infants with cleft palate. There was no consistent evidence to support or refute the use of one type of bottle over another based upon infant growth outcomes; however, the squeezable bottles were found to be easier to use to feed infants born with cleft palate (fewer modifications of the bottle/nipple were necessary)(26) \u2013Crosscut nipples have been used with rigid or compressible bottles. Some researchers caution against the use of artificial nipples that increase the flow of milk because rapid flow may prevent the infant from developing synchronized sucking, swallowing, and breathing(4) \u2013The SpecialNeeds Feeder by Medela(formerly called the Haberman Feeder) has a one-way  valve between the bottle and the nipple that allows for adjustment of three different flow rates (e.g., no/slow, medium, high). The reservoir (nipple area) is squeezed by the feeder when the infant sucks(4) \u2013The Pigeon bottle made by Respironics is a bottle that has a one-way  flow valve. Milk flow is adjusted by the tightness of the nipple collar on the bottle rather than by the feeder(15)",
            "Obturating plates:  An obturating plate (feeding obturator) is a prosthetic device placed over the gums of the upper jaw and is designed to occlude the cleft between the mouth and the nose and restore the separation between the oral and nasal cavities. It creates a rigid platform toward which the infant can press the nipple and extract milk, facilitating feeding and reducing nasal regurgitation and the risk of choking. In addition, it shortens the length of time required for feeding(30,38) \u2013Obturator plates can be made from different impression materials, including alginate, beeswax, periphery wax, and a very high consistency vinyl polysiloxane. The latter tends to be the material of choice because of its high viscosity, reducing the risk of aspiration or swallowing, along with a satisfactory retention level(30) \u2013These devices need to be replaced approximately every 3 months to accommodate the infant\u2019s facial growth(30) \u2013Advantages of using an obturator plate before surgical correction include the following:(30) -It provides a false palate against which an infant can suck, reducing the prevalence of feeding difficulties in newborns(30) -Assists with maintaining adequate nutrition(30) -Provides maxillary cross-arch  stability and prevents arch collapse after definitive cheiloplasty (surgical closure of the lip)(30) -Provides maxillary molding of the cleft segments into approximation before primary alveolar cleft bone grafting(30)  -Reduces nasal regurgitation(28) -Helps to position the tongue in the correct position to facilitate jaw development(28) \u2013There has been limited research investigating the effectiveness of palatal prostheses for infants with PRS and reports are limited to case studies(9,28,30) -Researchers at the University of Pretoria in South Africa conducted a retrospective study reviewing the management of 215 infants with PRS(38) -The majority of these infants who had upper airway obstruction and feeding problems were medically managed with custom-made  suction and drinking plates and additional feeding aids (special bottles and nipples) versus surgical intervention -With the use of these devices, a reduction in airway obstruction occurred in 70.6% and a reduction in feeding difficulties in 62.4% of the 215 infants -Surgical interventions were required for the following: 0.9% distraction osteogenesis, 2.3% airway obstruction, and 5.6% glossopexy",

            "Nasopharyngeal tube: Oral feedings can take place with the feeding tube in place; however, the position of the NP tube needs to be maintained. Infants can be in an upright or semi-reclined position with specialized nipples and bottles depending on patient needs(7)",
            "Tongue-lip adhesion: The infant will have limited lip and tongue mobility due to the surgical procedure. Oral feedings might be possible with a modified nipple that does not require active sucking. Factors influencing success with oral feeding include the presence of any airway obstruction and the status of pharyngeal swallow function(7)",
            "Mandibular distraction osteogenesis: It has been recommended to introduce nonnutritive oral stimulation, positive oral experiences, calming oral experiences, and oral feeding (if possible) while the distraction device is in place to encourage jaw motion and mobility of the temporomandibular joint. The SLP can also assist with managing oral secretions.(10) Lip movements are restricted due to the position of the turning device under the lower lip. Sucking often is compromised due to absence of lip seal and reduced tongue-tip mobility. Oral feedings might not be possible until the device is removed(7)",
