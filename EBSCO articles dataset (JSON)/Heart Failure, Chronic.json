            "Heart failure (HF) is a condition caused by inefficient relaxation (incomplete filling) or contraction (reduced ejection) of the myocardium, resulting in a reduced cardiac output, elevated intracardiac pressures, or both. The condition can be categorized into different types and severities, occurs during rest or stress, and can be acute or chronic(1) \u2013Types of heart failure include: -heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) or diastolic heart failure -heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) or systolic heart failure -low-output -high-output -right-sided -left-sided",

This causes impairment of endocrine, hematological, musculoskeletal, renal, respiratory, and vascular systems, which influence morbidity and mortality (2)"

It can cause reduced cardiac output and circulation of oxygenatedblood to organs and tissue. As a result, renal, hepatic, and gastrointestinal ischemia and failure can ensue",
            "Compensatory processes help the heart to function optimally during early stages of heart failure. These mechanisms aremostly caused by low cardiac output activating the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosteronesystem(5)\u2013Sympathetic nervous system stimulation  raises heart rate, BP, and force of myocardial contraction. While these actionsinitially raise cardiac output, eventually they tax the heart and increase its myocardial oxygen demand. Over time, themyocardium thickens and the heart enlarges. In the presence of coronary artery disease, the rise in myocardial oxygendemand can lead to myocardial ischemia\u2013Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone  system activation  causes further vasoconstriction and sodium and water retention,leading to a boost in blood volume. The increased blood volume increases ventricular filling and consequently cardiacoutput. However, over time, the extra blood volume can overwhelm the heart and worsen heart failure. In addition, themyocardium can thicken further and eventually dilate. The dilated myocardium can no longer contract effectively"

            "Rehabilitation following HF diagnosis or exacerbation can include cardiac rehabilitation, physical therapy, and/or occupational therapy(10)  -Cardiac rehabilitation  is an interprofessional program that provides physiological and psychological counseling, education, and physical activities that reduce cardiac mortality. The programs are generally divided into 3 phases: -Phase I: For inpatient that ends about 4 weeks after hospitalization and includes activities such as breathing exercises with peak flow spirometry and walking exercises -Phase II: Early outpatient period that includes physical exercise and respiratory exercise that improves exercise capacity and positively impacts QOL -Phase III: Long-term  outpatient that in addition to the physical activities also includes education, counseling, and mindfulness program \u203aPhysical therapy  should begin as soon as it is safe to and continue with an individualized and focused program with periodic progress evaluations. Activity can be challenging for patients with HF depending on severity of signs/symptoms but it is essential to promote recovery and maximal ability.Ongoing rehabilitation aims to restore strength and gait stability in ambulation after decompensation or reduced mobility during hospitalization for stabilization",
            "Early ambulation is recommended as soon as patient\u2019s cardiopulmonary condition is stable and optimal breathability is restored",
            "Gait rehabilitation may involve exercises to improve muscle strength, coordination, and lung capacity \u203aOccupational therapy  teaches patients with debilitating signs/symptoms how to conserve energy, group tasks and locations together, and become more independent as tolerated. Patients deconditioned after hospitalization can learn how to perform ADLs and self-care  using modified strategies and techniques depending on severity of symptoms, such as cooking and washing dishes for a few minutes at a time while sitting on a stool/chair in kitchen instead of standing",
