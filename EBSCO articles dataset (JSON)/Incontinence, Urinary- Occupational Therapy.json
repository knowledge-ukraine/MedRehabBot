Exercises consisted of pelvic floor muscle exercise, chair exercises, resistance band exercise, ball exercises, and walking -Control group received general health education classes 1x/month for 3 months -Urinary incontinence was decreased significantly from baseline to after intervention in the exercise group (p = 0.001) -No significant changes found in the control group \u2013One-to-one  pelvic floor muscle training for men who are incontinent after prostate surgery does not appear to be effective(8) -Based on 2 parallel randomized controlled studies conducted in the United Kingdom of 411 men with incontinence after RP and 442 men with incontinence after TURP -Men in intervention groups attended 4 one-on-one sessions held over 3 months with a therapist and received a home exercise program -Men in control groups received a lifestyle advice pamphlet that did not contain any information on pelvic floor muscle training -Outcomes (based on patient reports of urinary incontinence) were collected at baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after randomization -In trial of men with incontinence after RP, the rate of urinary incontinence at 12 months in the intervention group was not significantly different from that of the control group \u2013Preoperative sessions for pelvic floor muscle training in men who undergo radical prostatectomy do not appear to shorten postoperative duration of urinary incontinence(41) -Based on a randomized controlled trial conducted in Belgium with 180 participants -Patients in both control and experimental groups received a postoperative pelvic floor muscle training intervention with a therapist that included EMG biofeedback; the experimental group additionally received 3 preoperative sessions -Primary outcome measure was time to continence post-surgery;  there were no significant differences between the groups",
            "Biofeedback \u2013In conjunction with pelvic floor muscle training, biofeedback may improve urinary incontinence in women compared to pelvic floor muscle training alone(29) -Based on a systematic review of the literature (Cochrane Collaboration) -Studies included in the review were randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized  trials -Twenty-four  trials were used in the analysis; 16 trials used pelvic floor muscle training and biofeedback versus pelvic floor muscle training alone -Biofeedback studies included studies that used an instrument/device that recorded biological signals when pelvic floor muscles were contracted and gave auditory or visual information back to patient -Overall, the summary statistic was statistically significant in favor of pelvic floor muscle training with biofeedback, based on pooled data from subjective perceptions of patients -All trials also reported fewer leakage episodes in the pelvic floor muscle training and biofeedback groups \u2013Pelvic floor muscle training with biofeedback alone, with conventional electrical stimulation, or with dynamic electrical stimulation can improve quality of life for patients with stress urinary incontinence(30) -Based on a randomized controlled trial conducted in Germany of 108 women with urinary incontinence, randomly assigned to 3 intervention groups for 12 weeks: -Pelvic floor muscle training with biofeedback and conventional electrical stimulation (stimulation for 8 s, resting for 15 s, active contraction for 8 s, resting for 15 s) \u2013 15 min 2x/day -Pelvic floor muscle training with biofeedback and dynamic electrical stimulation (active contraction for 8 s, stimulation for 8 s, resting for 15 s) \u2013 15 min 2x/day -Pelvic floor muscle training with biofeedback alone (active contraction for 8 s, resting for 15 s) \u2013 15 min 2x/day -Outcome measures were quality of life (using King\u2019s Health Questionnaire) psychological stress (using a V AS), number of pads used, pad weight test, and contractility of pelvic floor muscle, at baseline and after interventions -Quality of life, psychological stress significantly improved in all 3 intervention groups  -Contractility of pelvic floor muscles was significantly increased in all 3 groups -Number of pads used was significantly decreased in all 3 groups -Pad weight test showed a significant improvement in all 3 groups -There were not any significant differences between all 3 groups",
            "Group therapy \u2013A group-based  exercise program for older institutionalized women is feasible for improving physical performance; however, this does not necessarily improve urinary incontinence(33) -Based on a multicenter randomized controlled trial conducted in the Netherlands -After participation in a 22-week  behavioral instruction plus exercise program aimed at reducing urinary incontinence, there was no significant difference between the intervention and control groups in outcome measures of urinary incontinence. Exercises performed in the group were designed to improve pelvic floor muscle strength as well as bladder and physical performance. Physical outcomes were measured by the Physical Performance Test (PPT) \u2013In a meta-analysis  comparing outcomes of individual therapy versus group therapy for urinary incontinence, the authors found that outcomes were equivalent for interventions provided in individual or group formats, but that in some studies patients had a preference for individual therapy(44)",

            "Transverse abdominis(46) \u2013Researchers who published a non-systematic  review in 2017 found that there is evidence to support training patients to co-contract  the pelvic floor muscles with the transverse abdominis -They report that there is a synergistic relationship between the deep abdominals and the pelvic floor muscles, with the abdominal muscles increasing intra-abdominal  pressure and the pelvic floor muscles acting before the rise in pressure to maintain organ support and urinary and fecal continence .
