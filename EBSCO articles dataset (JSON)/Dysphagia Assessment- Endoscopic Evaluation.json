            "Endoscopic evaluations of swallowing are procedures in which laryngoscopes are utilized to visualize laryngeal anatomy, physiology, and/or swallowing function from inside the pharyngeal cavity.(1,2,3) These evaluations can be used to supplement or substitute for a modified barium swallow study (MBSS). Types of endoscopic evaluations for dysphagia include fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES), FEES with sensory testing (FEESST), and rigid laryngoscopic examination. These tests can be performed by a specially trained speech-language pathologist (SLP) or an otolaryngologist (ENT)",
            "In addition to an SLP and an ENT, a gastroenterologist might screen patients for laryngeal dysfunction during an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy(4) \u2013In a study conducted in Italy in which 2 gastroenterologists were trained by ENTs to recognize laryngeal damage during the initial stage of an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, researchers concluded that given training and experience in recognizing laryngeal damage, gastroenterologists might be able to detect signs of reflux or premalignancy in the larynx with a flexible video gastroscope(4) \u2013If a gastroenterologist does suspect laryngeal involvement based on an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, the patient should be referred to an ENT for further workup"

            "Indicated in certain patients with dysphagia based on the outcome of an in-depth clinical swallowing examination (CSE), which should always precede an endoscopic evaluation of swallowing in patients with dysphagia(1,5) \u2013For detailed information on an in-depth  CSE, see Clinical Review\u2026Dysphagia Assessment: In-depth  Bedside Swallow Examination (Adults) ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T709037 and Clinical Review\u2026Dysphagia Assessment: In-depth  Bedside Swallow Examination (Pediatrics) ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T709064 \u2013In a study conducted in Turkey, researchers compared the effectiveness of a CSE, FEES, and electromyographic evaluation of swallowing in identifying dysphagia. Subjects included 24 patients who had a stroke within the previous 3 months. For the CSE, patients swallowed 10 mL of water and oxygen saturation was monitored by pulse oximetry. Researchers calculated a \u201cBedside Dysphagia Score\u201d by giving patients a point for each sign/symptom of dysphagia observed during the CSE (0\u20132 was considered normal swallow, 3\u20136 was considered dysphagia). Researchers found that a BDS score of 3+ was positively correlated with dysphagia identified by the FEES and the electromyographic evaluations. Researchers concluded that the CSE was as effective in identifying dysphagia post stroke as the FEES and electromyographic evaluations; however, they concluded that best practice for adequately evaluating  the nature of dysphagia was to perform a combination of a CSE and an instrumental examination(47) \u2013In a study conducted in Denmark, researchers found that a FEES was not superior to a clinical, noninstrumental examination of swallowing (i.e., CSE) in identifying dysphagia in terms of the number of cases of aspiration pneumonia that developed in a group of patients with acquired brain injury (i.e., stroke, traumatic brain injury, anoxia).(46) Over the course of 2 years, 138 patients from a national neurorehabilitation center were randomized into a FEES assessment group or a Facial-Oral  Tract Therapy (FOTT) assessment group. FOTT is a comprehensive program that provides a structured assessment and treatment for disturbances of facial muscles, speech-  and swallowing-related  jaw movements, breathing, swallowing, and the voice. The FOTT assessment is a clinical, noninstrumental examination of swallowing (i.e., CSE). Decision to initiate oral intake for these patients was based entirely on the single assessment; none of these patients had both types of swallowing assessments. Of the 138 patients included in the study, 16 developed pneumonia (4 FOTT/12 FEES); however, 9 were excluded from analysis because 6 developed pneumonia before oral intake was initiated and 3 had a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia but no radiological signs. Of the 7 included in analysis, 3 patients assessed by FOTT and 4 patients assessed by FEES developed aspiration pneumonia. For this reason, researchers concluded that there was no significant difference between the FOTT and FEES assessments in ability to identify dysphagia; however, the sample size was very small, resulting in low sensitivity(46) \u2013In a study conducted in the United States in which 7 SLPs who were considered experts in dysphagia were asked to watch videos of CSEs and, later, videos of FEES results and make recommendations for oral intake based on these videos. The researcher found that there was no agreement between the CSE and FEES ratings with respect to pharyngeal and laryngeal anatomy and physiology or the characteristics of pharyngeal dysphagia, when present. Additionally, the researcher found that despite being unable to accurately determine the safety of the pharyngeal swallow in 60% of the CSE videos, the SLP still made a recommendation for an oral diet in 25% of these cases. The researcher who conducted this study strongly cautioned SLPs against making a determination about swallowing safety and appropriate oral diet in patients with pharyngeal dysphagia without completing an instrumental examination(50)",
