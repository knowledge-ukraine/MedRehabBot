Problem Goal Intervention Expected Progression Home Program Paresthesias/pain Reduce or resolve symptomsActivity modification _ Implement changes to help reduce symptoms associated with provoking activities (e.g., headset for phone use; avoid resting arm on medial elbow in the car) _ Prescription, application of devices and equipment _ Trial of elbow or wrist orthosis in a neutral position,(19,20,21) towel roll to limit elbow flexion when sleeping(2) _ Physical agents and mechanical modalities _ Trial of iontophoresis or phonophoresis with dexamethasone for pain management as indicated and ordered by the physician _ _ Cryotherapy may be tried for pain managementGradual reduction in symptomsEducation the patient in activity modification, positioning, and orthosis use  Wrist/hand weakness Increase strength and prevent atrophyTherapeutic exercises _ Comparative methods of hand/wrist strengthening exercises in this syndrome have not been reported. Therefore, therapeutic strengthening and dexterity exercises should be guided by the evaluation on a case- by-case basis(11) _ _ To gently stretch the UN, instruct the patient to depress shoulder, laterally rotate and abduct shoulder, flex elbow, supinate forearm, place wrist in extension, and flex neck laterally away from the affected side(11) _ _ Electrotherapeutic modalities _ Electric stimulation can be applied to reduce or prevent atrophy(12)Progress each patient as appropriate and indicatedImplement a home exercise program with written and verbal instruction  Decreased ability to complete daily activities _Restore functional capacity _ _Functional training _ Instruction on alternative methods to complete ADLs _ Instruction in use of adaptive equipment to increase independence in self-care activities (e.g., use of a wash mitt if clawing limits the ability to hold a washcloth) _ _ Dexterity/coordination activities _ _ Refer to occupational therapy or hand therapy if necessaryPatient should gradually return to prior ADLs/sports _ _ Incorporate and progress functional training as indicatedEducate the patient on aggravating factors and provide activities helpful for increasing functional status Reduced elbow/wrist/ hand flexibility after surgery or prolonged splintingIncrease elbow/wrist/ hand ROMPostoperative therapeutic exercises _ Use of stretching techniques to mobilize the affected joint and increase the ROM lost due to surgery or prolonged immobilization _ _ Instruct the patient on how to complete active ROM and self- stretchingROM of the affected joint should gradually increase with continued therapyAfter patient education, may implement a home program of safe stretches Reduced nerve dynamic mobility of the upper quadrantIncrease neural dynamic mobilityManual therapy Mobilize the UN and other restricted elements of the upper quadrant. Utilize either the gliding or tension technique, as appropriateProgress to tension technique if gliding neural mobilization technique is initially startedIncorporate neural mobilization exercises into the home exercise program ."
