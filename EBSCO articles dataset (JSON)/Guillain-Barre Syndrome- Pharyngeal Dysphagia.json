The pharyngeal phase is the initiation of the swallowing reflex, when food is squeezed down the throat and the airway is closed off to prevent aspiration (food or liquid entering the airway) or choking. In the esophageal phase, the openings at the top and bottom of the esophagus move the food or liquid to the stomach by relaxing and tightening.(5)A patient with GBS might experience generalized weakness of the oral and pharyngeal musculature, leading to deficits in the oral and pharyngeal phases of swallowing Causes, Pathogenesis, & Risk Factors"

            "swallow examination": "The purpose of a swallow examination is to determine if the patient has dysphagia, to determine which function is disordered, and to establish any compensatory strategies (i.e., change in swallowing manner or food consistency) that would be safe and beneficial to the patientA CSE is usually the first part of a comprehensive swallowing examination or is used as an initial screening to determine the need for further evaluation.(8) Historically, the lack of a gag reflex function was used as a measure of dysphagia, but this has been demonstrated as unreliable as the sole indicator of swallowing function.(8) However, CSEs are poor at detecting silent aspiration (aspiration of food or liquid into the lungs without overt signs) and in determining the physiologic reason for a cough or a voice quality change. Due to its limitations, a CSE should be used as a complement to other instrumental measures rather than in isolation.(16) If oral intake is considered relatively safe, the patient should be observed swallowing different consistencies of food during the CSE.(14,16) The CSE should include the -A comprehensive case history and review of medical records(8) -Assessment of oral structures and motor function. Note the appearance of the oral mucosa (e.g., any inflammation or infection that may affect the oral stage of swallowing) and any pooling of saliva in the oral cavity. An inability to swallow may cause the saliva to pool in the mouth. Evaluate dentition in terms of the presence or absence of dental prostheses, the number and appearance of teeth, and general dental care.(8) Examine the facial, labial, and lingual ROM, speed, and strength. Examine velar elevation -Assessment of speech and vocal quality(8) -Assessment of feeding and mealtime techniques used by patient and caregivers.(8) When possible, conduct the CSE during a regular meal to observe the patient\u2019s skills in coordinating respiration and swallowing in a natural environment.(8) Assess patient\u2019s ability to achieve labial seal and contain bolus. Examine retrieval of different food consistencies from a spoon, cup, and straw -Observe the effects of alterations in posture or other compensatory techniques to improve swallow(8) -Evaluate the patient\u2019s ability to comprehend instructions and use compensatory strategies(17)In-depth  Bedside SwallowT709037In-depthT709064Several screening protocols have been published to assist the clinician during the CSE with adult patients(18) There are several clinical assessment scales and checklists to assist the clinician in the swallowing evaluation. Scales, surveys, and checklists commonly are used in the clinical examination but often do not include normative data, standardization, validation, or guidelines for interpretationLip, cheek, tongue, and jaw movement are rated during a typical meal. This scale can be used with patients from 1 year of age to adults(19)A statistically based protocol for patients who are dependent feeders. Scaled ratings are made for posture, tone, reflexes, general motor control, orofacial structures, orofacial sensory input, orofacial motor control, ventilation, and functional feeding assessment(20)Ratings of lip, jaw, and tongue movement during ingestion of liquids and solid foods. Assessment of sipping from a cup, coughing, gagging, and hypersensitivity associated with feeding and swallowing. A checklist allows for indication of abnormal oral structures, oral reflexes, positioning, diet, utensils, and feeding(21)Standardized screening survey that can be used with patients from 2 years of age to adults. Assesses BMI, restrictions in food textures and viscosity, dependence in feeding, and need for special utensils or positioning. Provides information on the severity of the swallowing disorder and can be used as an outcome measure(22)VFSS is performed in collaboration with a physician (radiologist or physiatrist) and an SLP or occupational therapist and is used primarily as a diagnostic procedure for dysphagia.(8) The patient eats and drinks a variety of liquids and solids mixed with barium while images are recorded with videofluorography.(23) All patients should be examined in the lateral and frontal positions to gain information on movements of the swallow and symmetry of bolus flow and pharyngeal wall contraction. The SLP examines for the presence of aspiration and the effectiveness of modifying different food consistencies or of modifying posture.(8) In contrast to the CSE, VFSS provides critical information on the pharyngeal and esophageal phases of the swallow.(14) Due to the levels of radiation involved, this procedure is not suitable to use frequently to monitor changes.(16) Given the unnatural surroundings, swallowing function observed during a VFSS is not necessarily identical to that displayed at mealtimes. Other variables that influence swallowing function include anxiety, fatigue, and medications.(24)(17,24) -Lip closure (ability to contain a liquid bolus) -Lingual elevation (the back of the tongue is slightly elevated) -Tongue-to-palatal  seal -Bolus preparation/mastication -Bolus transport/movement of the tongue (movement of the bolus to the back of the oral cavity) -Initiation of the pharyngeal swallow (swallow should be initiated when the bolus reaches the region of the posterior oral cavity) -Soft palate elevation and retraction -Laryngeal elevation -Anterior hyoid excursion -Laryngeal closure -Pharyngeal contraction -Pharyngoesophageal segment opening -Tongue base retraction -Epiglottic inversion -Esophageal clearanceModifiedT709046ModifiedT709077FEES is performed to evaluate the anatomy and physiology of the pharynx and the larynx, pharyngeal swallow function, and the patient\u2019s ability to manage secretions as well as the ability to swallow foods and liquids.(8) In addition, it can be used to explore a variety of diagnostic interventions such as varying bolus consistency, varying posture, or making use of visual feedback for reinforcement.(25) After the insertion  of the endoscope, the patient can self-feed  during the evaluation. Food must be light in color to enhance visibility (e.g., milk, pudding, yogurt, bread). FEES is preferred over VFSS when patients have safety issues related to radiation exposure and when patients need retesting. In addition, FEES is often less taxing than VFSS for patients who are weak and bedridden(25) -For detailed information on FEES and endoscopic examinations for dysphagia, see Clinical Review\u2026Dysphagia",

            "Diet modification:  Changing the food and/or liquid consistency of a patient\u2019s diet may assist in improving the safety and efficiency of the swallow as well as reduce fatigue associated with eating. For example, if a patient reports fatigue while chewing, the diet can be changed to mechanical soft texture. If the patient demonstrates aspiration of liquids or difficulty containing the liquid in the oral cavity, the clinician might investigate the used of thickened liquids; however, it cannot be assumed that all patients benefit from thickened liquids.(28)Thickened liquids are safer for some patients with dysphagia to swallow because they move through the oral and pharyngeal cavities more slowly than thin liquids, allowing more time for airway closure.(33) Clinicians should explore all possible intervention options before recommending thickened liquids; thickened liquids are associated with reduced overall fluid intake, increasing the risk of dehydration.(36) Additionally, the clinician must determine (by observing modifications during VFSS or FEES), rather than assume, that aspiration is not occurring with thickened liquids \u2013Carbonated thin liquids can reduce aspiration for some patients with neurogenic dysphagia(30) \u2013For detailed information on diet modifications for dysphagia treatment, see Clinical Review\u2026Dysphagia: Swallowing Therapy\u2013Compensatory ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T903567",
            "Postural therapy:  Several postures have been examined to assist in changing the direction of the flow of foods and liquids in patients with dysphagia, including the chin tuck, head back, head rotation, and head tilt. For patients with GBS, the chin tuck (chin down) may be used to compensate for reduced posterior motion of the base of the tongue. In addition, the chin tuck widens the valleculae so that patients can more easily capture the bolus during a delay in the pharyngeal swallow and prevent aspiration before swallowing(28) \u2013For detailed information on postural changes for dysphagia treatment, see Clinical Review\u2026Dysphagia: Swallowing Therapy\u2013Compensatory , referenced above",
            "Sensory stimuli: Changing the taste, volume, temperature, or carbonation of a food or liquid has been used as a way to heighten sensation and assist with delayed oral onset and/or delayed pharyngeal swallow. There is no research on the use of sensory stimuli with patients with GBS; research is needed to validate these techniques to determine their effects on a variety of different types of patients(28)",
            "Swallow maneuvers (voluntary changes in the swallow):  Swallow maneuvers include the supraglottic swallow, the super-supraglottic  swallow, the effortful swallow, and the Mendelsohn maneuver. Research has documented specific changes in the oropharyngeal swallow due to these maneuvers for some patients; however, further research is needed to determine the amount of time that these maneuvers should be used. Patients may not be able to perform maneuvers if they are unable to follow instructions or remember to use the maneuver during each swallow. These maneuvers may not be effective for patients with GBS who fatigue easily \u2013Supraglottic swallow: Breath is held before, during, and after the swallow so that the true vocal folds are closed.(28) This technique might be contraindicated for patients with GBS who have disturbed respiratory function \u2013Super-supraglottic  swallow: Breath is held while the patient swallows with extra effort.(28) This technique might be contraindicated in patients with GBS who have disturbed respiratory function \u2013Effortful swallow: Patient contracts the muscles involved in swallowing with great effort(28) \u2013Mendelsohn maneuver: The Mendelsohn maneuver is designed to increase the movement of the larynx and hyoid during the pharyngeal swallow. The patient holds the larynx up by using the muscles of the neck or with the hand  \u2013For detailed information on maneuvers in dysphagia treatment, see Clinical Review\u2026Dysphagia: Swallowing Therapy \u2013Swallow Maneuvers ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T709071 and the series of Clinical Reviews on each specific maneuver",
            "Adaptive equipment: Adaptive spoons, cups, and straws may be used to assist with the oral stage of the swallow. For example, if the patient has difficulty achieving a labial seal and cannot drink from a straw, a nonspill cup with a large handle may be useful as a facilitative aid. If anterior leakage continues, spoons can be used to place the liquid more posterior in the mouth. A nonskid mat can stabilize objects on the table",
