It is an independent predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in adults and associated with more target-organ damage, especially left ventricular hypertrophy, compared to normotensive individuals; 1.5\u20133x  increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality",
            "The Seventh Report of the Joint National Commission on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC-7) concluded that older teenagers with SBP from 120 mmHg to 140 mmHg and/or DBP from 80 mmHg to 90 mmHg are classified as having pre-HTN.(1)  In the updated 2018 guidelines,HTN in normal-weight adolescents is consistent with threshold values applied to adults (2,3)",
            "Prevalence of HTN in children and adolescents has been increasing over the past few decades worldwide(3,4,37) \u2013Increases can be seen in studies of children in the United States (between +3.2%\u2013to 20.6%),(38,39,40) as well as among children in Europe (+12.8%),(37) Latin America (between +4.8% to 15%),and in Asia (between 9.4% to 24%)(30,33,37,41,43)In a 2015 meta-analysis,  the prevalence of HTN in children ranged from 4.32% in6-year-olds  to 7.89% in14-year-olds.  In sub-group meta-analyses,  the prevalence of HTN was higher when measured by aneroid sphygmomanometry (7.23%) versus measured by mercury sphygmomanometry (4.59%) or oscillometric sphygmomanometry (2.94%) (4)  \u2013The reported rates of HTN vary from study to study. The variability may reflect different methodologies used to measure BP, including differences in equipment (manual or electronic, or 24-hour  ambulatory BP monitoring) and number of BP measurements made to diagnose HTN(37) \u2013Prevalence of hypertension is higher in obese and overweight children than in average-weight  children(53)"

            "Aerobic exercise (such as jogging and swimming) in contrast to isometric exercise (weight lifting) is associated with an increase in HDL cholesterol, a reduction in low-density  (LDL) cholesterol, and a reduction in stress level(6,17) \u2013Evidence-based  CDC physical activity guidelines recommend that school-aged  children perform 40\u201360  minutes of moderate-to-vigorous  intensity aerobic exercise/physical activity (70\u201380%  of maximal fitness) daily(12,20)",
            "Allow for the patient and parent to decide what physical activities are appropriate and enjoyablefor the exercise program. Examples are: \u2013Moderate to high dynamic exercise, low static: fast walking, running, swimming, basketball, baseball, soccer \u2013Moderate to high static, low dynamic exercises: weight lifting, karate, water skiing, sailing \u2013High dynamic, high static exercise: football, running (sprinting), wrestling, cycling",
            "Incorporate a variety of activities in order to prevent boredom while simultaneously increasing physical fitness; emphasize having fun while participating in a variety of physical fitness activities",
            "Recommend dietary changes with the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet: fruits and vegetables (at least 4\u20135 servings per day for each group) with reduced saturated fats, low-fat  dairy (\u2265 2 servings/day), reduced refined carbohydrates, reduced sodium intake (1,200 mg/day for 4\u20138 years of age and 1,500 mg/day > 8 years of age). The DASH diet is rich in potassium, magnesium, and calcium. It has been shown to lower adult SBP by 8\u201314  mmHg(1,4,9,10,17) \u2013Refer to http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/dash-diet/art-20048456  for more details \u2013The DASH diet has not been specifically studied in children or adolescents but has been shown to reduce BP in adults with HTN(6,9) \u2013Authors of a randomized, cross-over  clinical controlled trial conducted in Iran suggest that adolescents with MetS who adhere to the DASH diet for 6 weeks can reduce circulating levels of high-sensitivity  C-reactive  protein(43) -Sixty subjects with MetS were randomly assigned to adhere to the DASH diet or usual dietary advice for 6 weeks and then, after a 4-week  wash-out  period, subjects crossed over to the alternative diet \u2013The Framingham Children\u2019s Study demonstrated that children who consumed a diet high in fruits and vegetables (\u2265 4 servings) plus dairy products (\u2265 2 servings) in their preschool years had smaller age-associated  increases in SBP and DBP throughout childhood than children who consumed less of these foods, even after accounting for differences in BMI(9) -Evidence is controversial for a direct relation between sodium and BP levels in children with HTN. Some studies indicate no benefit of sodium reduction and others find a modest reduction in BP in obese adolescents, but not in lean adolescents(6,9) -Sodium restriction combined with potassium supplementation significantly reduced BP in young adults with borderline HTN; however, sodium restriction alone had no effect(1) -In adolescents, diets high in polyunsaturated fatty acids are reported to lower both SBP and DBP(1) -Insufficient evidence is available to recommend calcium and potassium supplementation for lowering BP in children with HTN -Magnesium supplementation was found by some studies to reduce DBP  -Some studies support the efficacy of potassium and calcium supplementation, which promotes sodium excretion and reduces sodium retention, thereby reducing BP -Further research is needed regarding the potential role of fat and fiber in BP in children prior to establishing recommendations -Limited studies indicate an inverse relationship between DBP and fiber in boys and between SBP and protein, cholesterol, and fiber in girls -Systolic BP was significantly reduced in teenagers with pre-HTN  when they increased their intake of polyunsaturated fats to 20% of caloric intake compared to a nonrandomized control group \u2013Recommend a reduction in caffeine intake, especially that in sodas.High caffeine intake is associated with higher SBP(51)",

Participants in programs that combine diet and physical activity interventions had a significantly greater reduction in both SBP and DBP than those in diet-only or physical-activity-only  interventions(49)",
        "It is recommended that children should be screened regularly for early detection of HTN so that treatment can be initiated as early as possible(30)",
        "Patient and caregiver/family lifestyle modifications, including weight management, daily exercise, dietary modifications, and health education, need to be emphasized.(30) The 2005 United States Dietary Recommendations for Children and Adolescents suggest that parents and guardians should be responsible for teaching their children about food and nutrition both at and away from home. The guidelines also recommend that parents and guardians serve as role models and lead by example(44)",
        "Healthcare professionals, educators, and policy makers should play a key role in the prevention of obesity and related risk factors for the development of HTN and other chronic diseases associated with the condition(30)",
        "The incidence of adult HTN, atherosclerosis, DM2, stroke, and/or MetS may be reduced and/or prevented by decreasing the risk factors for the development of HTN in children, such as obesity and poor physical fitness. Childhood BP is the best predictor of adult BP(2,9,13) Screening children for high cholesterol, high BP, obesity, and elevated glucose levels could identify both children and their parents at increased risk for CVD, DM2, and HTN(35) \u2013Researchers at Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital conducted a longitudinal study to evaluate the use of risk factor screening results of 5- to 19-year-old  children and adolescents in order to predict the parents\u2019 risk for developing CVD, DM2, and HTN(35) -Longitudinal data from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Princeton Follow-Up  Study, a 22- to 30-year follow-up  of Black and White school-aged children and their parents, were analyzed -Results suggest that pediatric risk factors predict risk for developing CVD, DM2, and HTN as in parents -Elevated triglycerides and LDL cholesterol levels in children and adolescents 5 to 19 years of age were predictive of parental CVD by mean age of 66 years",
        "Long-term  compliance with lifestyle modifications (dietary changes and regular physical activity) is more likely to be achieved through a family-based  approach versus a patient-only-oriented  approach, since most children view their guardians and siblings as role models(1,2,10) Weight loss is highly effective in reducing BP in overweight children; however, treatment interventions promoting sustained, long-term  weight loss in children have been largely ineffective. Innovative nutrition interventions need to be established to address the unique needs and circumstances of children (2,3,9) Educate children and adolescents on the deleterious effects of alcohol and smokin (2,3) "
