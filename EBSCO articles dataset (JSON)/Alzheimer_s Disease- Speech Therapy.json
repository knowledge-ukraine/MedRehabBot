            "Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects cognitive functioning and behavior.(1) In older adults, AD is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for more than 50% of dementia cases in the United States and Europe(1,3)",
            "In 2013, the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM -5) was published, in which the term dementia was replaced with major neurocognitive disorder (NCD).(57) According to the DSM -5, NCD exists on a spectrum defined by the extent of cognitive and functional impairments. The term mild NCD refers to cognitive impairment that does not interfere with independence but results in the need for occasional assistance, increased time to complete activities, or use of compensatory strategies. The term major NCD refers to cognitive impairment that is so severe that it results in considerable functional impairments and the individual requires assistance to complete ADLs.(57) DSM -5 authors note that the terms mild NCD and major NCD are inherently arbitrary and that the diagnosis will be based on the physician\u2019s careful history-taking  and observation to determine and appropriately label the extent of impairment.(57)In the DSM -5, AD is defined as \u201cmajor or mild neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\u201d Diagnostic criteria for AD in the DSM -5include an insidious onset and gradual progression in one or more cognitive domains(57)"

Over time, medications for AD become less effective or totally ineffective. Obtain a comprehensive list of medications prescribed and/or being taken (including OTC drugs) Medications for cognitive enhancement are most effective in patients with mildtomoderate forms of AD(1) There is some evidence that memantine might improve language function in patients with mildtomoderate AD; however, further research is necessary(64,66) The concurrent use of multiple medications is common among older adults who have complex medical conditions, and the side effects of these medications can adversely affect cognitive and communicative functioning.(9) Contact a pharmacist or physician with questions about medication side effects",

Additionally, the presence or absence of psychosis should be determined.(3,5) An SLP might conduct cognitive-linguistic  testing for a patient with AD to determine which underlying cognitive-linguistic  impairments (e.g., reduced executive functioning, memory impairment) affect language performance. The following is an example of aTo assess cognitive status of adults(5,17) -Sections include Orientation to Time, Orientation to Place, Registration, Attention and Calculation, Recall, Naming, Repetition, Comprehension, Reading, Writing, and Drawing  -Standardized test commonly used with patients who have AD(1) -The MMSE is scored out of a possible total of 30 points; a cutoff score of 23 typically is used to indicate cognitive impairmentTo detect mild cognitive impairment and early Alzheimer disease -Sections include visuospatial ability/executive function, naming, memory, attention, language, abstraction, delayed recall, and orientation -Scored out of a possible 30 points; normal is \u2265 26/30 -In a study conducted in Germany, researchers found that the German version of the revised Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (ACE-R)  was superior to the MMSE in detecting and differentiating mild cognitive impairment, mild dementia associated with AD, and frontotemporal lobar degeneration(18) \u2013Executive functioning testing(19) -Clock drawing; tests planning, attention, auditory comprehension, visuospatial skills, and numerical knowledge(19) -Verbal fluency (e.g., \u201cName as many animals as you can in 1 minute\u201d)(19,20,21) -Executive functioning impairment is present if the patient is able to name < 18 \u00b1 6 animals in 1 minute(19) -Can assess verbal fluency with a given category or letter (e.g., \u201cName as many words that start with \u201cS\u201d as you can in 1 minute\u201d)(21) -Studies have found that, over time, patients with AD have greater decline in semantic verbal fluency (when given a category) versus phonemic verbal fluency (when given a letter)(21,22) -In a study conducted in Italy, researchers found that the loss of verbal fluency for patients with AD in the category \u201ccities\u201d is not random but appears to be related to an area of \u201cmental geographic space,\u201d with better-preserved  naming around familiar cities and/or hometown(23) -Finding similarities/differences between two given items (e.g., apple-banana;  television-radio; watch-calendar)(19) -Assesses abstract reasoning(19) -Trail-making  tests (neuropsychological assessment of visual attention and task switching that requires the patient to \u201cconnectthedots\u201d of 25 consecutive targets on a sheet of paper or computer screen); assesses inhibition, vulnerability to interference (on the timed portion of the test), and perseveration(19) \u2013In addition to documenting cognitive deficits, it is important for the SLP to identify the patient\u2019s relative cognitive strengths(24) -Cognitive functions decline at different rates in patients with AD; social interaction and response to the patient\u2019s own name might be preserved even when the MMSE score is below 5(24)",

Major psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, major depression, and substance use disorder, should also be ruled out.(1,3,4) Other types of dementia, including vascular dementia, multi-infarct  dementia, Lewy body disease, and dementia associated with Parkinson disease, should also be ruled out(1)",

            "As the dementia from AD progresses, intervention should be modified to meet the patient\u2019s and caregivers\u2019 needs.(11) Treatment can occur in an outpatient setting, day care, assisted living environment, or skilled nursing facility",
            "Authors of a review of literature on pharmacological and adjuvant treatment (i.e., speech and language therapy) concluded that the full potential of pharmacological interventions to slow the progress of AD is realized when medications are combined with speech therapy.(64) The authors note that in order to cure AD, it would be necessary to find a medication to halt the associated neurodegeneration and synaptic loss; at present, the best treatment is speech therapy combined with medications to regulate acetylcholine, norepinephrine, and dopamine(64)",
            "Research in the area of cognitive psychology provides a set of principles that can be used to foster encoding, storage, and retrieval of information during the learning process. These principles include the following:(44) \u2013Repetition is beneficial/use of priming -Patients with dementia profit from repetition. Repetition can help these patients relearn forgotten information or learn new information(44) -Published research discussed in a literature review suggests that providing patients with AD with repeated opportunities to recall information is more beneficial than repeatedly presenting them with information. Priming is the practice of repeatedly activating related concepts, thus strengthening memory traces. Information that is primed is more accessible and more quickly retrieved. Patients with AD have relatively intact priming abilities \u2013Patients should be actively involved in learning -When patients generate a response, they are required to use greater effort than when they are required to only watch or listen. Since generating a response requires more effort, it requires patients to process information more deeply and creates a more long-lasting  memory trace. Additionally, since procedural memory is relatively intact during the early stages of AD, functional independence in ADLs can be better preserved by repeatedly performing procedures of daily living \u2013Error responses should be avoided -Patient errors should be avoided due to the fact that every time the patient repeats an error, the error response is strengthened. Errorless learning techniques attempt to reduce patient errors by providing patients with cues during retrieval in order to limit the number of possible responses and limit guessing when the patient does not know the correct response \u2013Focus on single rather than multiple tasks -Since patients with AD often present with divided attention deficits, they should not be asked to perform multiple tasks or processes concurrently \u2013Use cues to facilitate recall -Cues, such as providing the first letter of a name the patient is trying to recall, can refine the patient\u2019s search of his or her episodic memory. Use of such cues can be used to facilitate information recall or to decrease a patient\u2019s undesirable behaviors",
            "Authors of a published review of the literature described a number of intervention techniques successfully used with patients with dementia, including AD:(44) \u2013Repeated exposure -Spaced Retrieval Training (SRT): In SRT, a patient is expected to make a target response (e.g., identify the time for lunch) over gradually increasing increments of time. If the patient recalls the target information incorrectly, the therapist provides the correct response and then asks the patient to repeat it. If the patient recalls the target information correctly, the increment of time before the patient is asked to repeat the information is increased -Advantages of SRT include that SRT can be embedded in other tasks (e.g., having a conversation) and can be used to target both verbal and nonverbal responses (e.g., recalling a patient\u2019s room location or demonstrating swallow safety precautions). SRT is supported by extensive research(44) and has been shown to be effective when used with patients with AD as well as patients experiencing AIDS-related dementia(45) -In a study conducted in the United States involving 66 patients with dementia, researchers examined the effects of SRT on patients\u2019 ability to master communication goals. Patients who received SRT were found to be more likely to master treatment goals compared with those patients receiving therapy based upon \u201cbest practice\u201d procedures. During two follow-up evaluations (1 week post intervention and 4 months post intervention), patients who had received SRT maintained their mastery of communication goals better than patients in the \u201cbest practice\u201d group(45)  -Quizzes(44) -Published research has shown increases in category naming and recall of personal biographical information when patients participated in intervention combining repeated exposure and quizzes. The repeated exposure requires the patient to use effort to generate a response while the quiz is structured to constrain the set of possible answers (i.e., multiple choice questions), thus prompting a more directed search of episodic memory and reducing the potential for incorrect (error) responses \u2013Errorless learning (EL)(44) -Authors of a review of the literature showed that EL has been beneficial in teaching patients with dementia the names of persons, personal biographical information, how to use a calendar, how to use an electronic memory aid, and new face-name associations. Intervention using EL attempts to prevent patients from making mistakes while they are learning a new skill or acquiring new information. Patients are asked not to guess when they do not know the correct response; however, cues and forced-choice  recognition limit the number of possible patient responses -In a study conducted in the United Kingdom, researchers directly compared errorless and errorful (i.e., traditional therapy in which errors and guesses are allowed) therapy for object-name relearning in patients with mild to moderate AD. Researchers found that the techniques were equally effective for improving word-finding(56) \u2013Multisensory stimulation to evoke positive behavior(44) -The presentation of music, dolls or plush toys, and memory wallets may lead to increased performance success; stimulate positive thoughts, actions, and mood; decrease agitation; increase alertness; facilitate memory retrieval; and improve measures of life satisfaction. Specifically, the use of memory wallets and memory books that contain photos of family members and previous experiences has been demonstrated to increase the use of factual statements and on-topic conversation in patients with AD -In a study that examined the effect of music therapy on 288 individuals with varying degrees of AD, researchers found that participants in the groups that received music therapy had reduced scores on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), which evaluates severity and frequency of behavioral problems. Researchers concluded that music therapy reduced psychiatric and behavioral symptoms in individuals with advanced AD and thus reduced caregiver distress \u2013Personal computers(44) -Personal computers have been shown to be effective in teaching patients with dementia face-name associations and topographical information (e.g., the route from the dining room to the patient\u2019s bedroom) \u2013Cognitive-linguistic  stimulation programs(44) -Research supports teaching functional communication skills and ADL training for patients with dementia in order to prevent a deterioration of skills that may result from disuse in institutional settings. This can be done in cognitive-linguistic  stimulation programs that incorporate different aspects of cognition such as language, problem solving, memory, and reasoning -In a study conducted in Japan with two different groups of older adults, one with AD and one without, researchers found that a daily cognitive intervention program resulted in an immediate positive effect on executive functioning when compared to controls who did not participate. For both groups of older adults, the cognitive training program used reading and math tasks and took place 5 days per week, for about 15 to 20 minutes per session. There were significant improvements on the AD intervention group\u2019s Frontal Assessment Battery scores; however, there were no changes in MMSE scores(67) \u2013Montessori approach to cognitive-linguistic  stimulation programs(44) -Intervention programs based upon the Montessori method have been found to improve mood, socialization skills, and engagement of patients with AD. The fundamentals of the Montessori method are as follows: -Tasks are broken down into a hierarchy of steps ranging from simple to complex -Patient is provided with extensive cueing and guidance to lead to successful outcomes -Feedback is given on the accuracy and appropriateness of a patient\u2019s response in an effort to reduce patient levels of frustration -Materials that stimulate the senses and cognitive processes are used during intervention",
            "In an RCT examining goal-specific  cognitive retraining in 281 individuals with AD, dementia, or mild to moderate cognitive impairment, researchers found that participants demonstrated self-rated  and caregiver-rated improvementcompared to the control group. Results were maintained at 3 months and 9 months. However, there was no use of an objective measurement to determine if there were true improvements in cognitive function or if improvements in self-rating  and caregiver rating were due to other factors (61) ",
            "Authors of a systematic review of methods to enhance verbal communication between patients with AD and their caregivers found only a few studies that mete the inclusion criteria(46) \u2013Memory aids demonstrated the greatest effectiveness in improving the discourse of patients with AD \u2013The memory aids, such as a memory book, are used to guide conversations and help the patient stay on topic while discussing subject matter that is of interest to him or her \u2013The best outcomes were found when memory aids were utilized in combination with caregiver training",
            "Other intervention techniques \u2013Student-supervised  physical exercise and partnered volunteering/Elder Rehab program(47,48) -This intervention program is based on the following principles: 1) multiple physical, cognitive, and social needs should be addressed in an intervention program; 2) patients should have opportunities to demonstrate competence and be useful to others; and 3) clinicians should identify and focus on the numerous spared neuropsychological and physical abilities of patients with AD -The Elder Rehab program consists of four components: physical exercise, volunteer work, memory training, and language stimulation. Twenty-four  individuals with early to moderate dementia associated with AD, their caregivers, and a series of student volunteers participated in this 4-year  program administered by the University of Arizona. For 10 weeks per semester, the individuals with AD were accompanied by their student partners during 1\u00bd\u20132  hours per week of physical exercise and during 1\u00bd\u20132  hours of volunteer work. During their time together, student volunteers engaged the individuals with AD in language and memory exercises (e.g., sustaining attention to a stimulus/task, deep processing of content, and \u201con demand\u201d production of verbal responses) -Prior to beginning this program and at the end of each semester, the individuals with AD were assessed using standardized objective measures of physical fitness and mood. Outcomes indicated significant improvements in aerobic fitness, strength, and mood over 4 years. A subgroup of 4 individuals with AD completed all 4 years in the Elder Rehab program. These 4 individuals underwent cognitive and language testing at the time of enrollment and after every two semesters of intervention. Results indicated that all 4 of these individuals maintained or improved their performance on multiple discourse outcome measures(47) \u2013Environmental modifications -Speech-language  intervention should focus on teaching the patient ways to retain effective communication skills, providing compensatory strategies, and stabilizing the patient\u2019s environment. A patient\u2019s environment can be stabilized by establishing a routine and by reducing environmental distractions. Objects and topics that the patient encounters in daily life should be integrated into cognitive-communication  therapy(11) -Patients with temporal-spatial  disorientation may experience confusion and agitation. Environmental cues such as posting the date, making familiar objects visible, and displaying pictures of loved ones may help to reassure and redirect patients who experience these symptoms(3) -In a systematic review of 42 articles examining a variety of environment-based  modifications for individuals with AD, researchers found that there was strong evidence for temporal-spatial interventions such as orienting room objects, making the toilet visible, and utilizing unobtrusive safety measures such as camouflaged doors -Each patient\u2019s environment should be assessed for safety and security \u2013Family/caregiver training -Patients, families, caregivers, and staff should be educated on the proper use of environmental and behavior modification techniques to support the patient\u2019s target behavior(3) -Family, caregivers, and staff should be educated on ways to use gesture, visual cues, and a reduced speech rate to increase their ability to effectively communicate with a person with communication impaired by AD(11) -In a study conducted in Canada, researchers examined the role of caregiver prosody in conversational interactions with patients with AD(49) -The findings did not show a significant improvement in conversational success with either increased caregiver prosody or decreased caregiver prosody; rather, the researchers found that in one subgroup of participants, increased conversational success was associated with increased caregiver prosody and in the other it was associated with decreased conversational success -The personal variability seen in response to caregiver prosody underlines the importance of an individualized approach to caregiver training for patients with AD; there is no \u201conesize fits all\u201d  \u2013Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS): rTMS is painless, noninvasive stimulation of the brain with low-frequency  magnetic fields to create electrical currents in specific regions of the brain; it is currently used in research studies and not widely available as a treatment modality(55) -In a research study conducted in Italy, researchers examined rTMS with 10 patients with AD who were randomly assigned to one of two groups\u2013  one group underwent a 4-week  treatment of rTMS and the other underwent 2 weeks of placebo and 2 weeks of rTMS treatment(55) -The rTMS was applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for short periods separated by long periods of no stimulation; sessions were 25 minutes per day, 5 days per week -The results of the study showed a significant effect of rTMS on auditory sentence comprehension -The group that received 4 weeks of treatment did not have any additional benefits on language comprehension compared with the group that received 2 weeks of treatment and 2 weeks of placebo; researchers concluded that 2 weeks was sufficient for improvement -The effects of the rTMS were maintained at 8 weeks posttreatment .
