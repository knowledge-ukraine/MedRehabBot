            "Joint mobilization \u2013Scapular mobilization combined with glenohumeral joint mobilization as compared to glenohumeral joint mobilization alone has grade-B  evidence for improvement of scapulohumeral mechanics as well as glenohumeral mobility in patients with AC(32) \u2013Researchers from Turkey compared stretching alone to adding mobilization with stretches in treatment of persons with AC(30) -Thirty patients were randomized into the two groups -Both groups performed a home exercise program and were treated for 6 weeks (18 sessions) -The group that performed stretching exercises and joint mobilization had improved abduction and external rotation ROM and function scores at 1-year follow-up  compared to the stretching exercise alone group \u2013Researchers in India concluded from a study that the effects of Mulligan\u2019s MWM in conjunction with supervised exercises improve ROM, pain, and functional ability in patients with type-2  DM(28) -Sixty-six  patients with type 2 DM were randomized into 2 groups: the control group received supervised exercises alone and the experimental group received exercises and MWM -Participants in both groups received treatment sessions 2x per week for 12 weeks. Participants in the exercise-alone group were directed to do the same exercises at home at least 2x per day -The majority of improvements occurred during weeks 6\u201312 -Internal rotation and abduction AROM in the MWM group was 20.4 and 23.4 degrees greater, respectively, than in the control group \u2013MWM may be more effective in increasing scapulohumeral rhythm compared to end-range  mobilization (ERM).In a study, MWM was more effective than ERM as indicated by improvements in SPADI and ROM scores(29) \u2013Researchers from South Korea compared mobilization techniques of Maitland and Kaltenborn and concluded that both techniques are effective in improving pain and ROM in patients with AC(12) -Twenty patients with frozen shoulder were randomized into either the Kaltenborn group or Maitland group for 12 therapy sessions, 3 times a week for 4 weeks -Outcome measures for this study were pain using the V AS and assessment of internal rotation and external rotation ROM -Prior to treatment,both groups received hot packs to the affected shoulder for 20 minutes followed by interferential current (IFC) for 15 minutes. Joint mobilization of their respective groups was later performed -Kaltenborn grade III is defined as sustained stretching at an intensity upon which the joint capsule is stretched. Patients are positioned in supine with the scapula fixated with a wedge. Physiotherapist places the humerus in maximal abduction while maintaining 90\u00b0 of elbow flexion with forearm rotated toward the head. A posterior translation is applied to the humeral head. Translation is applied for 30 seconds for 15 sets over a 10-minute  period -Maitland grade III anterior-posterior  oscillation was performed. Grade III is defined as an intensity that slightly exceeds restriction points of the ROM to provoke tissue resistance, while providing an oscillating movement with a slow and large amplitude. Patients are positioned in supine with the scapula fixated with a wedge. Physiotherapist places the  humerus in maximal abduction while maintaining 90\u00b0 of elbow flexion with forearm rotated toward the head. An anterior-posterior oscillation is applied for 30 seconds for 10 minutes -After 4 weeks, there was a significant decrease in pain and improvements in ROM. There was no significant difference between Maitland and Kaltenborn group in pain or ROM improvements \u2013Researchers in Turkey concluded from a one-week  study that participants with AC who received cold packs and posterior capsule stretching had improved shoulder flexion and active internal rotation as well as decreased pain severity during activity. The group that received posterior and anterior capsule stretching exercises had decreased pain at rest at night and increased abduction and total elevation movement(31)",
            "Therapeutic exercise \u2013The addition of rotator cuff strengthening exercises to the treatment of AC results in superior outcomes(21) -Based on a prospective, parallel-group  RCT conducted in India with 42 patients with AC -The experimental group received TENS and joint mobilization as well as exercises to strengthen the rotator cuff muscles; control group received only TENS and joint mobilization -Treatment program was delivered in 12 sessions over the course of 4 weeks -Significantly greater improvements in pain level, shoulder ROM, and shoulder function were seen in the experimental group compared to the control group \u2013A hospital-based  exercise class might be more effective than individual physiotherapy or a home exercise program to improve AC(10) -Based on an RCT conducted in the United Kingdom -Seventy-five  patients with primary idiopathic AC were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: group exercise class supervised by physiotherapist, individual physiotherapy, or home exercises -Outcome measures included ROM, Constant Shoulder Score, Oxford Shoulder Score, SF-36,  and Hospital Anxiety and Disability Scale -The exercise class group had greater improvement in shoulder symptoms than either the individual therapy group or home exercise group. Improvement in ROM was greater in both physiotherapy groups than in the home exercise group",
            "Continuous passive motion (CPM) \u2013CPM is more effective in reducing pain and improving function in individuals with AC and DM than conventional physical therapy(23) -Based on an RCT in Turkey of 41 DM patients with AC -The patients were randomized to one of two groups -Group 1 \u2013 used CPM device; 1 hour/day, 5 days/week, 4 weeks duration -Group 2 \u2013 conventional physical therapy including ROM, pendulum exercises, and active stretching; 1 hour/day, 5 days/week, 4 weeks duration -All patients had hot packs, ultrasound, and TENS regardless of their therapy group -After 4 weeks of physical therapy, patients were instructed to continue a home exercise program of pendulum and passive ROM exercises for an additional 8 weeks -Outcomes assessed at baseline, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks were V AS for pain at rest, night, and with activity; Constant Shoulder Score; and SPADI -Group 1 had greater total improvements in function, flexion and abduction ROM, disability, and pain",
            "Soft tissue mobilization (STM) \u2013STM to the shoulder girdle structures (i.e., infraspinatus, teres minor, supraspinatus, and pectoralis minor muscles) increases shoulder AROM(6) -Based on a case study series of 8 patients with AC in the United Kingdom -The patients received STM to the shoulder girdle structures and performed progressive stretching and strengthening home exercises",
            "Regional interdependence: a model for physical therapy treatment based on the concept that physical impairments might be related to remote anatomical locations in the musculoskeletal system. Therapy involves treatment in locations other than the region of the primary complaint(15) \u2013In a case series conducted in the United States, 5 consecutive patients with AC received between 11 and 21 sessions over 5 to 10 weeks. Treatment was individualized based on impairments and was modeled on regional interdependence targeting the shoulder, shoulder girdle, and spine. Interventions included joint and soft tissue mobilization, muscle  stretching and strengthening, patient education, and modalities. All of the patients improved in the DASH as well as shoulder ROM(15)",
            "Modalities \u2013Authors of a Cochrane systematic review of studies of electrotherapy modalities for AC published up to May 2014 found 19 trials, including a total of 1,249 participants, that were RCTs or quasi-randomized  controlled clinical trials comparing an electrotherapy modality to placebo, no treatment, a different modality, or another intervention(11) -Only LLLT and pulsed electromagnetic field therapy have been compared to placebo -No trials have compared an electrotherapy modality plus manual therapy and exercise to manual therapy and exercise alone -There was moderate-quality  evidence that LLLT plus exercise may be more effective than exercise alone for reducing pain and improving function and low-quality  evidence that LLLT may be more effective than placebo for global treatment success -It is unclear whether pulsed electromagnetic field therapy is more or less effective than placebo -It is unclear whether other electrotherapy modalities are an effective adjunct to exercise -The authors concluded that further high-quality  RCTs are needed to determine whether electrotherapy modalities are beneficial for AC compared to interventions with evidence of benefit, such as glucocorticoid injections and arthrographic joint distension \u2013Ultrasound, massage, iontophoresis, and phonophoresis have not been shown to be effective in the treatment of AC(20,25)",
            "Muscle energy techniques (MET) can provide improvements in external ROM and decrease pain in patients with AC(13) \u2013In a crossover research design from Thailand involving 24 patients (ages 40\u201365),  individuals were randomly assigned to be treated with MET and then mobilization or mobilization then MET during the first week, and then treated with another MET pattern at another visit. All participants were given MET, MET preceding mobilization, mobilization, and mobilization preceding MET \u2013Outcome measures for this study included active external rotation ROM, pain assessment (V AS), shoulder function assessment, and patient satisfaction assessment \u2013The therapist positioned the shoulder into external rotation until resistance was felt. The patient was asked to perform an isometric contraction at 25% of maximum voluntary contraction in internal rotation for 5 seconds followed by active external rotation to the patient\u2019s end range for 30-second  holds, followed by complete relaxation of the muscle. The therapist would passively place the patient into external rotation again until a new end range was found \u2013The therapist would perform mobilization technique in 4 directions, with a goal to improve external ROM: anterior-posterior  mobilization, posteroanterior combined with cephalocaudal, external rotation mobilization, and posteroanterior combined with cephalocaudal direction in prone \u2013Results of this study show that all treatments (mobilization and/or MET) were beneficial to improving AC, but patients who had MET had more beneficial outcomes as compared to mobilization techniques in regards to improving active external rotation and pain levels .
