            "There is need for additional research to develop evidence-based training programs to teach youth safe and proper landing techniques to reduce the incidence of noncontact ACL injuries. Currently, research supports the importance of a comprehensive neuromuscular strength and conditioning program that is sport specific and age appropriate. Plyometric/ agility training, strength and power, neuromuscular control and endurance, and balance/proprioceptive training are fundamental components of ACL prevention programs",
            "Plyometric training, neuromuscular strengthening programs, and strength traininghave been associated with decreased risk of ACL injury(4)",
            "U.S. researchers assessing the effects of an ACL injury prevention program in 1,439 female high-school  athletes in a prospective study in 2006 did not find that a plyometric training program reduced risk of noncontact ACL injuries \u2013Soccer, basketball, and volleyball players were randomized to a control group (862) or an ACL injury prevention program (577) \u2013Participants in the prevention program participated in a 20-minute  plyometric-based  exercise program twice a week throughout their season in addition to their usual practices. The program emphasized proper mechanics of landing from a jump and deceleration when running \u2013At the end of 2 seasons, there were 6 confirmed noncontact ACL injuries: 3 in the prevention group and 3 in the control group. The incidence of noncontact ACL injuries per 1,000 exposures was 0.167 in the prevention group and 0.078 in the control group, yielding an odds ratio of 2.05, which was not significant (p > 0.05) \u2013The researchers concluded that the 20-minute  plyometric training did not reduce the risk of noncontact ACL injuries in female high-school  athletes. Other factors such as program compliance, neuromuscular strength, and agility were not analyzed",
            "The F-MARC  11+ program may be a useful program to minimize the risk factors associated with ACL injury in preadolescent female soccer players. The F-MARC  11+ is an injury prevention program designed for players age 14+ that focuses on proper form and techniques during all exercise activities(12) \u2013Fifty-one  female athletes between the ages of 10 and 12 were randomized to either the F-Marc  group (n = 28) or control group (n = 23) \u2013The F-MARC  group performed 15 in-season  sessions 2x/week \u2013Conclusions showed that players in the F-MARC  11+ program showed decreased risk factors, notably reduced peak kneel valgus moment, compared to those in the control group",
            "Authors of a similar study on the F-MARC  11+ program have also concluded that this program can be more effective at reducing some of the risk factors associated with ACL injuries among preadolescent female athletes compared to just adolescent athletes. The program works to reduce knee valgus angle and moment during double-legged jump landing(15)",
            "Authors of a retrospective study have suggested that a prevention program for reducing ACL injuries in male athletes may include the following(14): \u2013Performing multi-directional  exercises such as the single-leg maneuver \u2013Performing reactionary based activities under unexpected situations \u2013Appropriate foot positioning \u2013Type of playing surface \u2013Enhance neuromuscular aspects that include fatigue, proprioception, muscle activation, and inter-joint coordination .

It typically takes about 4\u20136 weeks before any benefit for the athlete can be noted. Many programs have an intense start- up period for about 6 weeks followed by less frequent or no additional training _ _Instruct the patient on a home exercise program that complements the physical therapy exercise program  ."
