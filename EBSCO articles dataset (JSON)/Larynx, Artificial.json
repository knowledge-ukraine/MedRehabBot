            "There are two categories of artificial larynxes  electrolarynx (EL) and pneumatic artificial larynx (PAL).(1) An EL is a handheld, battery-powered  device that vibrates electromechanically.(1,2) The EL is placed against the patient\u2019s neck or inside the patient\u2019s mouth,and electronic vibrations are transformed into words within the oral cavity.(2,3) Pitch and volume settings can be personalized to each patient\u2019s preferences.(2) The EL is the most commonly used method of alaryngeal speech among laryngectomees.(4,5,6) A PAL consists of a vibratory valve inside a plastic tube, with one end placed over the patient\u2019s stoma and the other end inside the patient\u2019s mouth.(1,4) Pulmonary air is directed through the tube,and the vibrations reach the patient\u2019s mouth, where they are transformed into speech(1,4)"

Those laryngectomees who did not do this naturally were trained to do so by the researchers(1) \u2013In a case study conducted in France, researchers reported on an implantable artificial larynx. Following total laryngectomy for laryngeal cancer, the permanent tracheal prosthesis was implanted via cervicotomy, and 4 months later a removable portion of the artificial larynx valve system was implanted via endoscopy. The permanent portion of the implantable larynx did not interfere with swallowing, and the patient continued to be able to eat by mouth. The removable portion allowed the patient to speak in a whisper voice when the stoma was occluded manually. The removable portion also caused mild dysphagia, for which therapy was provided(21) \u203aSee Description and Indications of device/equipment and Guidelines for use of device/equipment , above .

            "Initially, finding the best place for either an intraoral artificial larynx or a neck placement EL is accomplished by trial and error(4)",
            "For intraoral devices, generally, the best place is behind the patient\u2019s lips, off of the tongue and to the side of the mouth as not to interfere with articulation(4)",
            "The placement of the EL on the neck differs for each person; generally, the head of the EL is placed on the neck directly below the jaw(19)",
            "The therapist should palpate the patient\u2019s neck to find the most malleable and/or flexible part of the neck that is likely to create the best source of vibration",
            "The neck-placement EL must be held tightly against the neck for optimum energy transfer(19)At first, the therapist might place the artificial larynx before attempting speech; as sessions progress, the patient will start to know where the best vibration is achieved and eventually he or she will place the artificial larynx in the correct position every time without cues or assistanceArtificial larynxes may be used while the patient is an inpatient and as an outpatient at home.

Eventually, the artificial larynx will be used in all communicative settings  Lack of voice Patient will time the initiation of electrolarynx vibration with start of articulatory movementsPrescription, application of devices and equipment",
            "Poor intelligibility with ELs is often associated with incorrect timing of the vibration. The message is degraded if the vibration starts before the patient begins articulating or continues after the patient stops articulating. This is not usually an issue with PALs because the person\u2019s breath provides the vibration source for speech. The therapist trains the patient to push the button on the EL at the same time as he or she starts moving his or her lips to speak. (**This intervention is based on the author's experience as an SLP practicing in acute and acute rehab settings during 2005-2015)",
            "If the patient has the opportunity to be trained with an EMG- controlled EL, the timing of vibration onset and therefore speech intelligibility may be improved as it creates an articulatory- coordinated voice onset(6) (e.g., the movement of the muscles that initiate articulation also turn on the EL vibratory source)At first, the therapist will demonstrate the timing of the EL by using the device him- or herself. As sessions progress, the patient will become more skillful with the timing of the vibratory source and eventually he or she will start the vibration at the correct time every time without cues or assistanceArtificial larynxes can be used while the patient is an inpatient and as an outpatient at home. The SLP will determine an appropriate home program for artificial larynx use. Eventually, the artificial larynx will be used in all communicative settings  Lack of voice Patient will exaggerate articulation to increase intelligibility of speech with artificial larynx(20)Prescription, application of devices and equipment",
            "Because the vibratory source from artificial larynxes is not as natural sounding as the human voice, exaggerated articulation is required on behalf of the patient to produce intelligible speech(20)",
            "The SLP will educate the patient on how to slow the rate of speech and make appropriately exaggerated articulatory movements(20)",
            "The patient then practices exaggerated articulatory movements in syllables, with word lists, sentences, and eventually conversational speechThe patient learns the articulatory movements with visual, verbal, and placement cues.
