            "Stroke is a nontraumatic brain injury caused by occlusion or rupture of cerebral blood vessels that results in sudden neurological deficit characterized by loss of motor control, altered sensation, cognitive and/or language impairment, disequilibrium, and/or coma(1,24,32)",
            "Stroke rehabilitation involves various therapeutic interventions aimed at improving functioning and independence after stroke(24)",
            "Literature suggests that many patients who have strokes have premorbid low physical fitness and become significantly more deconditioned after the insult, and that these patients are not being challenged enough in therapy to induce the metabolic stress needed to enhance their cardiopulmonary fitness(2)",
            "Also of importance, neurologically impaired patients require a greater volume of oxygen (VO 2) than healthy controls for ADL performance and ambulation and they rate poor energy levels ahead of mobility limitations, pain, emotional reactions, sleep disturbances, and social isolation as the area of greatest personal concern(2)",
            "Paresis reduces the number of motor units available for recruitment, thereby reducing metabolically active tissue and lowering the oxidative potential. A strong relationship exists between bilateral thigh muscle mass and VO2 peak, but post stroke, it is estimated that 50% of normal motor units are functioning.  (2)",
            "Altered muscle fiber composition and recruitment patterns of paretic muscles may also contribute to poor fitness; elevated proportions of fast, more fatigable fibers that are less glucose sensitive are found in the paretic leg of persons after stroke, contributing to reductions in VO 2 peak(2)",
            "Impairments after stroke can also reduce ventilatory reserve (defined as the difference between the maximal available ventilation and the ventilation measured at the end of exercise), leading to limited oxygen available for exercise(2)",
            "Even small (8\u201315%)  increases in exercise capacity may be of practical significance for persons with neurological disorders and make the difference between being dependent and being independent(2)",
            "Low fitness levels are associated with higher mortality in the neurologically impaired population(2)",

Eccentric flywheel exercise of the lower extremity was performed twice weekly for 12 weeks by the intervention group; the control group maintained daily routines ",
            "Researchers in South Korea found that a progressive resistance training program can improve the stride of the affected side of patients after stroke and improve walking speed(21) \u2013Fifteen chronic stroke patients participated; outcomes measured included peak torque of knee extensors and gait ability measured by electric gait analysis of walking speed, walking cycle, affected-side  stance phase, and affected-side stride length",
            "Researchers in the United States who conducted an RCT with crossover design found greater functional gains with the addition of power training to functional task practice and no deleterious consequences (e.g., exacerbation of spasticity or musculoskeletal complaints)(12) \u2013Nineteen chronic stroke patients participated. Power training consisted of high-intensity,  dynamic resistance training; outcome measures used were Wolf Motor Function Test, FMA, Ashworth Scale, and FIM",
            "Researchers in the United States found that lower limb muscle power training resulted in improvements in muscle strength and power that were accompanied by improvements in self-selected  and fastest comfortable walking speeds(22) \u2013Twelve patients, 6\u201360  months poststroke, participated in 3 training sessions per week for 8 weeks. Exercises included leg presses, calf raises, and jump training, all performed at high concentric velocity, as well as fast walking",
            "Researchers in Canada investigating barriers to delivering high-intensity  training identified therapists\u2019 beliefs about the intervention, which may not be congruent with the evidence, as a key factor. System-level  factors such as resources and access to graded exercise test and monitoring equipment were also identified as barriers(39) \u2013The authors emphasized that ways to facilitate higher-intensity  interventions in clinical practice need to be identified",
            "Researchers in South Korea found significant differences in the muscle activity of the paretic lower limb between fast and slow exercises(23) \u2013Ten stroke patients performed fast and slow squat exercises. Rectus femoris was found to be highly activated during the fast squat exercises but not during the slow squat exercises. The authors concluded that training programs for stroke patients need to be designed with consideration of the speed of the exercises",
            "Authors of a 2016 systematic review with meta-analysis  concluded that respiratory muscle training is an effective method of improving respiratory function, respiratory muscle strength, and exercise tolerance in patients poststroke. Studies included were RCTs that examined the effects of respiratory muscle training versus nonrespiratory muscle training in patients poststroke. Eight studies met inclusion criteria(28) \u2013The authors recommend assessing respiratory muscle strength before commencing a poststroke rehabilitation program to identify patients for whom respiratory muscle training might enhance functional abilities \u2013More well-designed  RCTs are needed to determine the best methods, including device, frequency, intensity, and duration, to meet the needs of individual patients or patient subgroups",
            "Researchers in South Korea found that abdominal muscle strengthening accompanied by inspiratory muscle training improves pulmonary function poststroke and may be used as an adjunct to conventional physical therapy(29) \u2013Based on an RCT involving 23 patients with stroke \u2013The effects of abdominal muscle training and inspiratory muscle training on pulmonary function, balance ability, and abdominal muscle thickness were measured \u2013Forced vital capacity, FEV1, deep abdominal muscle thickness, and Berg Balance Scale scores were significantly improved in the experimental group compared to the control group",
            "Researchers in China who conducted an RCT found that rehabilitation training of core muscles can effectively improve balance, function and walking speed of patients post stroke(13) \u2013180 individuals with chronic unilateral hemiparetic stroke participated \u2013Participants were divided into observation and control group (N = 90), both of which received conventional stroke rehabilitation 5 days per week for 8 weeks. The observation group (OG) also received core muscle stability training \u2013Outcome measures used included BBS, 10MWT, Brunnstrom staging, Fugl-Meyer  motor assessment(FMA), and ultrasound measurements of abdominal wall thickness of the paralytic side (transverse abdominis, internal and external obliques) \u2013Results showed significant improvements in all outcome measures, including increased thickness of the transverse abdominis in the OG",
            "Authors of a Cochrane systematic review published in 2017 found moderate evidence that circuit class rehabilitation (therapy that involves working in groups rather than individually with a therapist) is an effective way to improve mobility after stroke and that patients may be able to walk farther, faster, and with more confidence in their balance. Seventeen  studies that involved 1,299 participants were included. Positive effects were obtained by persons whose stroke was more than a year prior as well as those whose stroke was within the past year(14)",
            "Authors of a 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis  found that balance can be improved by an exercise therapy program in the chronic phase after stroke. Subgroup analyses were performed for the different types of exercise training (balance and/or weight-shifting training, gait training, multisensory training, high-intensity aerobic exercise training, and other training programs) to identify which regimens were most effective. There was a significant improvement after balance and/ or weight-shifting  training and after gait training, but no significant effects were found for other training regimens(40)",
            "A systematic review of RCTs (N = 1,772 participants) published in 2018 showed that inclusion of treadmill training in conventional physical therapy post stroke results in significant improvements in walking speed and ability. Authors state that further research is needed to identify optimal training parameters (16)",
            "Researchers in South Korea found in an RCT that mat-based  Pilates may be beneficial for improving gait in poststroke patients and the intervention could be applied to individuals with various levels of disability by adjusting the intensity of training(30) \u2013Twenty individuals with unilateral chronic hemiparetic stroke participated \u2013The Pilates exercise program was conducted by certified Pilates instructors and consisted of 3 sessions per week for 60 minutes, for 8 weeks. Exercises focused on core muscle stability \u2013Outcome measures included 3-D motion analysis of gait. Results showed that an 8-week  Pilates program effectively improved patients\u2019 gait parameters .
