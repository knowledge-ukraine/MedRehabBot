The authors of this study recommended that \u201cfull vertical motility\u201d of the eye be added as part of the above minimum diagnostic criteria for Moebius syndrome so that the condition will be more accurately diagnosed and individuals receive the proper information regarding treatment, prognosis, and genetic counseling from their physicians(14)  -There are four recognized categories of Moebius syndromecharacterized by small or absent brainstem nuclei that control the cranial nerves(2,4)marked by the loss and weakening of neurons in the facial peripheral nerve(2,4)characterized by the loss and degeneration of neurons and other brain cells, microscopic areas of damage, and hardened tissue in the brainstem nuclei(2,4)marked by muscular symptoms despite a lack of lesions in the cranial nerve(s)(2,4) -The acronym \u201cCLUFT\u201d is used to classify and grade the severity of Moebius syndrome according to which parts of the body are involved(1) -Cranial nerve(1) -Lower limb(1) -Upper limb(1) -Face(1) -Thorax(1) -Document communication history, including speech and language milestones as well as any motor and developmental delays(3,4)",
