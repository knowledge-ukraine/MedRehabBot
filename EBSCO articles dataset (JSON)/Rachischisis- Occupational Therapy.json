If CSF begins to leak or the skin covering the defect is very thin, immediate surgical correction (i.e., at birth) is warranted(1) For patients with myelomeningocele, surgery for initial sac closure and placement of a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt is typically performed within the first 48 hours after birth to reduce the risk of infection of the CNS(1,3) Although most myelomeningoceles are closed withinthe first 48 hours, there is a need to protect the defect and exposed placode (area on the spinal cord that is open dorsally and frequently rests on a meningeal sac) from further excoriation and contamination until surgery. Authors of a study evaluated the ease of care, cost of supplies, neonatal temperature, and moisture of the placode at time of closure in neonates with two different types of dressing methods, occlusive dressing method versus drip method(36) The occlusive dressing method was easier to care for and was 6 times more cost effective. There was no difference in the two methods with respect to moisture of placode and temperature of the neonate The occlusive method was equally effective as the drip method at keeping the placode moist and it was easier to care for and more cost effective  The need for immediate surgery occurs in about 15% of meningocele cases(3) Throughout the lifespan, individuals who have VP shunts often require shunt revisions due to malfunction or obstruction(3) Prenatal/intrauterine surgery can be done for sac closure and shunt placement; however, this type of surgery is not performed routinely as evidence is insufficient to draw firm conclusions on its risks and benefits(1,3) multidisciplinary team approach with a primary physician, neurologist, urologist, orthopedic surgeon, neurosurgeon, orthotist, psychologist, physical therapist (PT), and OT(1,4) bladder catheterization for complete emptying of the bladder and to minimize renal scarring(1,3) frequent urodynamic evaluations(1) bowel training program with stool softeners and enemas if necessary(1) close monitoring of function and ambulation for any worsening of clubfoot, spasticity, sensory loss, or tethered cord that might warrant neurosurgical intervention(1) orthotics for ambulation(1) frequent examinations of the skin to monitor for formation of decubitus ulcer(s)(1)",

        "Taking folic acid prior to and during pregnancy can reduce the risk of SB in the developing fetus(4) Authors of a 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis  of the global birth prevalence of SB by folic acid fortification status concluded that mandatory legislation enforcing folic acid fortification lags behind the evidence, especially in Asia and in Europe, and that, in areas that do not have government legislation, SB is significantly more common(32) \u2013The authors suggest that folic acid supplementation for SB is not being used to its full potential worldwide All women of childbearing age should take a supplement containing 400 mcg (0.4 mg) of folic acid daily(1,4)  Women with SB, women who have a child or sibling with SB,and women who have had a pregnancy affected by SB should take 4,000 mcg (4.0 mg) of folic acid for 1 to 3 months prior to becoming pregnant and for 3 months after becoming pregnant(4) Women who are taking valproic acid, carbamazepine, methotrexate, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, and/or other medications that can alter folate metabolism will likely need a higher daily dose of folic acid and should discuss this with their primary physician or gynecologist(1)",
        "Patients with SB who have had a reaction to latex should: wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace(4) carry auto-injectable  epinephrine(4,6) carry sterile nonlatex gloves and other nonlatex medical items for emergencies(4)",
        "Authors of a systematic review designed to identify barriers, themes, or additional insights specific to the care of SB patients transitioning from pediatric to adult healthcare settings found no one transitional model to be better than another but suggested that any degree of transition education and monitoring was beneficial for these patients(33)"
