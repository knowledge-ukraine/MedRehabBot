            "Leprosy is a chronic granulomatous infection caused by Mycobacterium leprae , an acid-fast  bacillus, that occurs in both children and adults.(1,18) M. leprae preferentially affects cooler parts of the body (e.g., skin, mucous membranes, peripheral nerves).(1) Leprosy is characterized by distinctive skin lesions and/or enlarged nerves accompanied by sensory loss.(1) Complications, i.e., the disability and morbidity associated with leprosy, result from nerve damage(2)",
            "There are different classifications of leprosy: \u2013WHO classification(1) -Paucibacillary (PB): no more than five skin lesions; no detectable bacilli on skin smears(1) -Includes the indeterminate, tuberculoid, and borderline tuberculoid subtypes described below(3) -Multibacillary (MB): six or more skin lesions; might be skin-smear  positive for bacilli(1) -Includes the borderline lepromatous and lepromatous subtypes described below(3) \u2013Classification according to the Ridley-Jopling  system (named for the British researchers who developed it in the 1960s) includes six types based on skin and neurological changes as well as biopsy(1,2) -Indeterminate (I)(1,2) -Patient will have one or more hypopigmented or hyperpigmented macules (circumscribed changes in skin color that are neither raised nordepressed)(1) -Patches of the skin with sensory loss; patients in the early stage of the disease have relatively preserved sensation(1) -Tuberculoid (TT)(1) -Patient will have hypopigmented macules with well-defined  demarcations; loss of sensation in these macules(1) -Nerve involvement occurs with signs such as ulnar, peroneal, and greater auricular nerves that are often palpable and visibly swollen(1) -Nerve involvement leads to lagophthalmos (inability to completely close the eyelids), keratitis (cornea inflammation), and corneal ulceration(1) -Neuriticpain(1) -Muscle atrophy, especially in the small muscles of the hand(1)  -Borderline-tuberculoid  (BT)(1,2) -The skin lesions resemble those in TT leprosy; however, the lesions are not as well-defined(2) -The number of lesions varies but is usually more than 5; the diameter is usually 10 cm or more(2) -The lesions typically are symmetrical and multiple nerves may be affected(2) -Borderline-borderline  (BB)(2) -Relatively rare and usually evolves quickly toward the Virchowian type(2) -Many foveal lesions are present with different sizes and shapes(2) -Intense involvement of nerves and positive skin smears are common(2) -Borderline-lepromatous  (BL) (Virchowian)(1,2) -Many skin lesions: macules are variable in shape and not symmetrical in distribution(2) -High bacterial load and positive bacilloscopytypical(2) -Nerve damage occurs, but not as quickly as in BB and BT forms of leprosy -Lepromatous (LL) (Virchowian)(1,2) -The disease is more symmetrical, with nondistinctive skin lesions present(1,2) -Nerve involvement occurs in the later stages, with distal extremities affected first(1) -Pure neural leprosy is a rare variant of leprosy characterized by neuropathy without evidence or history of typical skin lesions. Ulnar, tibial, and fibular nerves are most commonly affected(2) -Histoid leprosy is a rare variant of leprosy and is associated with sulfone resistance. A patient with histoid leprosy will present with superficially or deeply fixed cutaneous nodules, plaques, or pads(2)",
            "Since the implementation of a free multidrug regimenmade available by WHO in 1981, the global incidence of leprosy has decreased significantly. In 2019 the number of new cases reported worldwide was 202,256; 34 countries reported zero new autochthonous cases (cases that originated in their own country). The COVID-19  pandemic disrupted case detections: new-case  detection reported worldwide was decreased by 37% in 2020 compared to 2019 (127,558 new cases reported and 45 countries reporting no new cases)(4) \u2013WHO has identified 23 countries with highest rates of leprosy as priorities to reduce the number of cases including Bangladesh, Brazil, Democratic Republic of Congo, India, Indonesia, and Nepal)(26) or application of equipment Unemployment Connect the patient with appropriate social services for job placement; train the patient to perfect specific occupational tasks needed for him or her to return to gainful employmentFunctional training _ Adaptive/assistive device and equipment training(16,17) _ _ V ocational assessment and training(16) _ _ See Treatment summary , aboveProgression will vary between patients based on the interventions selected and the response to treatment tasksProvide patient and family/caregivers with written instructions regarding functional activities that can be performed at home and correct use and/ or application of equipment .
