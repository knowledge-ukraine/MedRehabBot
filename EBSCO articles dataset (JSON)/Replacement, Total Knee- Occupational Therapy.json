            "Knee replacement is an elective surgical procedure in which damaged cartilage and bone are removed from the joint and replaced with an artificial joint (prosthesis)(3)",

            "The major types of knee replacement(1) \u2013Hemiarthroplasty or partial knee replacement \u2013 This procedure is for isolated, single-compartment  disease. The articular surfaces are removed from either the medial or lateral condyle and plateau and replaced with prosthetic components made of metal alloys cemented to the bone ends with a polyethylene spacer between them (i.e., metal on polyethylene) \u2013Bicompartmental total knee replacement (TKR) \u2013 The surfaces of both compartments (i.e., both medial and lateral) are removed and replaced with prosthetic components, as above. The anterior cruciate ligament usually is removed \u2013Tricompartmental TKR \u2013 The articular surfaces of the femur, tibia, and patella are removed and replaced with prosthetic components, as above. The patella is usually resurfaced with all-polyethylene  components",
            "A TKR involves replacing the knee joint with an implant that attaches the tibia to the femur(6) \u2013Three types of TKRs; classified by how much constraint is built into the artificial joint(8) -Totally constrained: femoral portion is physically attached to the tibial portion and requires no ligamentous or soft tissue support -Semiconstrained: two separate components that glide on each other; however, constructed in such a manner as to prevent excessive femoral glide -Totally unconstrained: relies completely on the body\u2019s ligaments and soft tissues to preserve the stability of the artificial joint \u2013Semiconstrained and totally unconstrained are the most used types; totally unconstrained offers the patient the most normal ROM and gait(8)",

            "OT is effective in improving functional status of patients following TKR Specific OT interventions will vary according to patient goals and characteristics (e.g., comorbidities, age, prior level of function), but can include the following: -ADLs/IADLs(6,7,8) -Initially, patients will perform ADLs from a sitting position(8) -Introduce assistive and/or adaptive equipment to increase safety and independence with ADLs/IADLs(7,8) -Instruct on how to properly don and doff knee immobilizer or brace if required by the patient(7) -Gradually increase the demands placed on the patient for ADLs/IADLs(8) -Includes increasing the demands of balance required for each task as the patient\u2019s strength and stability improve(17) -Functional mobility and transfer training(7,8,17) -Bed mobility(7,8) -Bed to chair transfers with knee immobilizer(8) -Toilet/commode transfers(7,8) -Shower chair/tub seat transfers(7) -Car transfers(7) -Therapeutic and conditioning exercises(6,8,17) -Strengthening upper and lower extremities(6,8) -The patient progresses from PROM exercises to low-resistance dynamic exercise for the affected lower extremity as tolerated according to physician orders(8) -Pain and swelling management(6) -Ice and compression as needed(11) -Assistive and adaptive equipment(6) -Environmental modifications(6,8)  -Technology/equipment(6) -Education(6,17) -Patient education(6) -Energy-conservation  techniques(6,8) -Joint protection strategies; knee precautions(8) -Instruct on avoiding prolonged static positioning of the knee with daily activities(7) -Safety, fall prevention, knee precautions(6,17) -Family education(6)",
            "Recommendations and treatments \u2013Authors of a systematic review and meta-analysis  found that an exercise rehabilitation program should last at least 8 weeks to improve pain, physical function, stiffness (measured by WOMAC), knee extension strength, active knee flexion ROM, TUG results, and gait speed(28) \u2013The AAOS recommends that patients can return to driving following a TKR when they areno longer on narcotic pain medicines, strength has returned to baseline, and reflexes have returned to baseline(30) -This most commonly occurs around 4 weeks, but can range between 2 and 8 weeks. More recent studies lean towards 2 weeks, which is likely due to improved surgical techniques(29,30) \u2013Improving functional outcomes -Authors of an RCT (N = 20) compared an eccentric-concentric  versus concentric program on muscular strength and QOL after TKR(31) -Both groups participated in a standard rehabilitation program and then each group had separate additional exercises -Eccentric-concentric  group: performed 3\u20134 sets of 5\u201310  repetitions of eccentric flexion exercises on the leg press and eccentric extension exercises on the seated leg curl machine and/or pulley -Concentric group: performed 3\u20135 sets of 5\u201310  repetitions of concentric exercises for the knee extensors and flexors -Eccentric-concentric  group showed significant improvement over the concentric group in physical function tests: TUG and 10-meter  walk test. Hamstring muscle peak torque, self-reported  physical function, and QOL tests were also all significantly better -Authors of a meta-analysis  of RCTs on progressive resistance exercise (PRE) foundthat PRE may lead to improvements in physical function and greater ultimate strength(32) -An early progressive resistive exercise program can promote improved balance following TKR(21) -Authors of an RCT compared the static, semidynamic, and dynamic balance of patients receiving routine rehabilitation (control group) to those receiving extra early resistive exercises in addition to routine rehabilitation (experimental group) -Both groups participated in a routine 6-week  rehabilitation program consisting of 3 1-hour  therapy sessions per week focusing on edema and pain control, increasing ROM, thigh muscle strengthening, isometric and isotonic exercises for the knee flexors and extensors, and gait training. The experimental group completed additional isotonic progressive resistive exercises targeting the knee extensor muscles -Patients in both groups had improved scores on measures of static, semidynamic, and dynamic balance 7 weeks and 9 weeks post-surgery,  but those in the experimental group showed the greatest improvement in scores -Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) can promote improved functional recovery during the early postoperative period following TKR(22) -Authors of a meta-analysis  investigating the efficacy of NMES after TKR found that NMES used as an adjunct to traditional rehabilitation produced somewhat better scores on measures of physical functioning during the initial weeks after surgery than traditional rehabilitation alone. However, the benefits of NMES over traditional rehabilitation alone waned over time -Study included 6 RCTs, each of which contained a control group (traditional rehabilitation alone) and an experimental group (traditional rehabilitation and NMES) -The use of NMES specifically targeted activation of the quadriceps muscle -The authors concluded that NMES can support improved functional recovery during the initial weeks after TKR and may be most beneficial for patients with severe lack of muscular activation  -Balance and proprioceptive training can increase balance and function following TKR. Authors of asystematic review and meta-analysis  found that balance and proprioceptive exercises can easily and safely be added to traditional rehabilitation programs and lead to positive functional outcomes(33) -Pilates-based  exercises used in addition to standard exercise programs can promote improved balance, physical functioning, and QOL following TKR(25) -Authors of a study compared the effectiveness of Pilates-based exercises used in conjunction with a standard rehabilitation program (study group) with standard rehabilitation alone (control group) in improving hip and knee strength, knee ROM, postural control and balance, and QOL after TKR -Patients in both groups participated in a standard exercise program throughout their hospitalization. After discharge, patients in the control group were instructed to continue with a standard exercise program and patients in the study group were instructed in Pilates-based exercises to complete in addition to the standard exercise program. Patients in both groups were monitored on a weekly basis by a physiotherapist -At 6-week  follow-up,  patients in the study group showed significantly better scores on measures of balance, physical function, and physical components of QOL than those in the control group -Aquatic therapy as part of the post-surgical  rehabilitation for TKR may support improved subjective physical function and pain up to 6 months after surgery(23) -Authors of a systematic literature review investigating the effectiveness of aquatic therapy as part of the rehabilitation process for total hip replacement and TKR found moderate evidence to support its use during the rehabilitation process \u2013Increasing overall physical activity following TKR: -Despite TKR success at decreasing pain and improving physical function of most patients, overall physical activity levels do not necessarily increase.(34)Finding ways to encourage increased activity levels is important to the patient\u2019s overall health -Authors of an RCT (N = 45) evaluated the feasibility of using a physical activity feedback method (Fitbit) to assess patients\u2019 activity levels following TKR. They found this method to be a feasible intervention that should be studied further(35) -Authors of an RCT compared financial incentives and health coaching in increasing patients\u2019 physical activity levels following TKR(36) -Four groups consisted of a control group (received only calls to monitor general recovery), telephone health coaching (received calls to motivate patients to stay active), financial incentive (patients provided with financial rewards for set goals), and telephone health coaching with financial incentives -The telephone health coaching with financial incentives led to ameaningful increase in step count and physical activity compared to the control \u2013Authors of an RCT (N = 104) evaluated the benefit of adding an intensive functional rehabilitation (IFR) program to a standard rehabilitation program. The addition of the IFR program for 2 weeks did not significantly improve ADLs (measured by the FIM and BI) in patients following TKR(37) .
