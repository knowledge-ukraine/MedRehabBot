Massage any scars to mobilize adhesions _ _ Therapeutic exercises _ Passive knee motion can begin immediately after surgery. Knee flexion helps support bone healing by increasing compressive forces on the patella.(1) Fracture healing time is variable depending on the severity of injury. Nevertheless, gentle active/assisted ROM and stretching exercises can be implemented as soon as pain permits to relax tightened muscles and to prevent muscle and tendon shortening and scar tissue formationProgress each unique patient as appropriate and indicatedRecommend a home program that incorporates ROM activities as indicated _ Heel slides, standing hamstring curls, calf stretches, and heel raises  Reduced lower extremity strengthImprove lower extremity strengthElectrotherapeutic modalities _ No direct evidence is available to support the use of electrotherapeutic modalities for patellar fracture healing. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation may assist in VMO retraining _ _ Therapeutic exercises _ Begin lower extremity strengthening when appropriate or when cleared by physicianProgress to quadriceps resistance training.
