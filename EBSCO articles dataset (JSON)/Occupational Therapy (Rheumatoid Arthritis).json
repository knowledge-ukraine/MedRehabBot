            "RA is a chronic, inflammatory, systemic disease that most prominently affects the diarthrodial joints (freely mobile joints held together by a joint capsule; also called synovial joints).(1,2) In RA, the immune system attacks the body\u2019s own tissues (specifically the synovial membrane, a thin membrane that lines the joints) rather than foreign cells such as bacteria or viruses.(3) This causes synovitis and tenosynovitis, resulting in both joint pain and systemic inflammation.(1,4) Individuals with RA often experience intermittent periods of intense disease activity, referred to as flares, followed by periods of remission with no disease activity or symptoms, and is variable with regard to onset and progression.(1,4) For others the disease is continuously active and gets worse over time.(1) Clinically distinguishing features of RA include morning stiffness that lasts for over 1 hour and the gel phenomenon (stiffness that occurs after long periods of sitting or inactivity)(1,4)",
            "RA typically involves 3 or more joints, but in 2010 the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism updated guidelines aimed at identifying RA in patients with synovitis in at least one joint in the absence of an alternative diagnosis to explain the synovitis, and a score of at least 6 (of the possible 10) from 4 domains. These 4 domains include(42) \u2013the number and site(s) of involved joint \u2013serologic abnormalities (presence of rheumatoid factor or anti-citrullinatedpeptide/protein  antibody) \u2013elevations of inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate and/or C-reactive protein [CRP]) \u2013the duration of symptoms",
            "The 2010 diagnosis criteria allowfor early diagnosis of RA(42)",
            "RA is a systemic disease and can affect extraarticular body systems such as the heart, pulmonary and GI systems, and skin(1,4)",
            "The course of RA in any given patient can vary significantly; there are at least three known disease courses: \u2013Monocyclic: having one episode that ends within 2 to 5 years of initial diagnosis with no recurrence; typically, monocyclic cases occur if RA is diagnosed very early in the course of the disease and/or the patient has aggressive treatment(21) \u2013Polycyclic: symptoms and levels of disease activity fluctuate over the course of the patient\u2019s lifetime(21)  \u2013Progressive: the symptoms of RA become increasingly severe, and the course of the disease is unremitting(21)",

They concluded that physical activity and psychosocial interventions (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy) can provide small to moderate benefit in decreasing self-reported  fatigue in patients with RA(41) \u2013Authors of a 2017systematic review evaluated 51 evidence level 1 studies published between 2000 and 2014. Outcome measures evaluated were ability to perform ADLS, pain, fatigue, depression, self-efficacy,  and disease symptoms. Strong evidencesupported the use of aerobic exercise, resistive exercise,aquatic therapy, patient education, self-management, cognitive-behavioral  approaches, multidisciplinary approaches, and joint protection to improve outcome measures. Some evidence supported the use of dynamic exercise, tai chi, and yoga to improve outcome measures(40)  \u2013According to the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network\u2019s (SIGN) national clinical guideline for the management of RA, the benefits of skilled occupational therapy for patients with respect to improved QOL is clear; however, there are limited studies from which efficacy conclusions can be drawn, and evidence from RCTs is absent(19) -SIGN\u2019s guideline emphasizes that occupational therapy should focus on: -improving ADLs, providing equipment and adaptations as necessary(19) -maximizing function and level of independence of the patient(19) -educating patients on joint protection strategies, including how to reduce strain, properly use assistive devices, utilize rest schedules and energy-conservation  techniques, and use proper exercise and splinting techniques(19) \u2013Authors of a critical appraisal of6 systematic reviews on the efficacy of interventions used by OTs for adults with RA that were published between 2007 and 2013 reported that there was sufficient evidence to support the use of therapeutic exercise, patient education on joint protection strategies, and splinting for pain, inflammation, and grip strength. There was insufficient evidence to support the use of tai chi as an intervention for RA(23)",
            "Specific occupational therapy interventions will vary according to patient goals and characteristics (e.g., comorbidities, age, prior level of function, motivation for therapy) but can include the following: \u2013Hand therapy for patients with RA -Hand therapy is an essential part of rehabilitation for patients with RA due to the significant impact of hand dysfunction on ADLs and IADLs(1) -A certified hand therapist (CHT) is an OT or PT with a minimum of 5 years of clinical experience and 4,000 or more hours in direct practice in hand therapy(20) -Most practicing CHTs are OTs (85%)(20) -For additional information on hand therapy in patients with RA, see Clinical Review\u2026Rheumatoid Arthritis: Hand Therapy (Occupational Therapy) ; referenced above \u2013ADLs/IADLs(3,4) -Introduce assistive and/or adaptive equipment to increase safety and independence with ADLs/IADLs(4) -Incorporate frequent rest breaks into ADLs/IADLs -Gradually increase the demands placed on the patient for ADLs/IADLs(4) -In general, patients with RA should not engage in activities that require the hand to be in a static position for a prolonged period of time(4) \u2013Splinting/orthosis use(1,3,4) -Indicated for reducing inflammation, decreasing pain, supporting unstable joints, limiting undesirable joint motion, increasing ROM, and properly positioning joints(4) -Resting hand orthosis is very common in the treatment of RA(4) -Orthoses can be utilized appropriately in all stages of RA(4) -Stage I (early): resting orthoses for decreased inflammation and pain as well as joint protection(4) -Stage II (moderate): day orthoses to provide comfort and decrease deforming stresses on joints; night orthoses to relive pain and/or protect joints against deformity; orthoses designed to improve ROM(4) -Stage III (severe): day orthoses to promote increased function; night orthoses for positioning and comfort(4) -Stage IV (terminal): day orthoses to promote increased function; night orthoses for positioning and comfort(4) -Special considerations for use of orthoses in patients with RA -The added weight of the orthosis can put additional stress on the upper extremity, resulting in pain and fatigue; ensure the splint is as lightweight as possible(4) -Forces are transferred from the splinted to adjacent, unsplinted joints, which can cause these joints to become more symptomatic(4) -Skin tolerance can be problematic because of the increased risk of fragile skin in patients with RA(4) -Patients with sensory impairments will need close monitoring when using an orthosis to identify signs of pressure(4) -Modify orthosis straps as needed to allow for increased ease and decreased joint stress when donning and doffing(4)  -Authors of a systematic review on the efficacy of working wrist splints in patients evaluated 23 studies, including 9 RCTs. Both qualitative and quantitative studies were included in the systematic review. Authors reported there was strong quantitative and qualitative evidence that working wrist splints reduce pain in individuals with RA. Qualitative studies indicated that the primary use of splints for persons with RA was for reduction of pain and swelling. Additionally, there was moderate evidence that working wrist splints improve grip strength. There was insufficient evidence that working wrist splints improve function in persons with RA(24) \u2013Therapy gloves(26) -The authors of a systematic review evaluating glove use in RA found that use of therapy gloves (i.e., any type of gloves that aim to deliver treatment \u2013manage pain, restore function, \u201crelax or calm or calm the wearer\u201d) are most useful in decreasing symptoms versus improving function \u2013Therapeutic and conditioning exercises(3,4) -There is no exercise program that is universally appropriate for patients with RA; all exercise programs must be specifically tailored to the needs of a given patient(4) -Exercise programs for patients with RA should avoid unnecessary joint stress that causes pain and joint swelling and should work within the patient\u2019s comfortable ROM(4) -Authors of a study demonstrated that their strengthening and stretching for RA of the hand (SARAH) program was effective at improving function, increasing grip strength, and stabilizing pain. The program is a tailored and progressive 12-week  exercise program aimed at improving function in patients with RA in their hands and wrists. Online training for occupational therapists is available at https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/exercises-for-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-hands-a-course-for-healthcare-professionals (36) -Train the patient to perform each exercise slowly, smoothly, and with proper technique; additionally, educate the patient on the rationale for each specific exercise(4) -Strengthening upper and lower extremities with resistance (isometric or isotonic) as indicated by physician order; not appropriate for acute stage(4) -Discontinue any resistance exercise if the patient reports pain or if the exercise creates deforming forces or it compromises joint stability(4) -Grip strengthening exercises can be performed with light putty for the joints in the hand(4) -Active or passive stretching can be incorporated to increase joint mobility; not appropriate for acute stage(4) -Cardiovascular exercise(4) -Appropriate exercises include stationary bicycling, walking, low-impact  aerobics, and tai chi(4) -Health-enhancing  physical activity and energy conservation(28) -Researchers in Sweden conducting an RCT designed to assess the impact of therapy focusing on facilitating \u201chealth-enhancing  physical activity\u201d and fatigue management found that providing \u201cperson-centered\u201d  therapy significantly reduced reported levels of fatigue -Intervention included encouraging a combination of moderately and vigorous physical activity and education around balancing life activities \u2013Pain and swelling management(3) -Rest(4) -Rest is a way for a patient with RA to reduce both pain and inflammation(4) -Rest can be indicated for the entire body or achieved locally through splinting or avoiding/modifying activity to allow rest for a specific joint(4) -During stages of active systemic inflammation, 8 to 10 hours of sleep with periods of rest in the afternoon are recommended for patients with RA(4) -Thermotherapy and cryotherapy(4) -Can be helpful for management of pain as well as maintaining or improving the patient\u2019s ROM(4) -Thermotherapy can increase blood flow, relieve pain, and increase tissue elasticity; however, because it is possible for thermotherapy to increase inflammation as well, do not use thermotherapy with acutely inflamed joints(4)  -Thermotherapy can be delivered through hot packs, paraffin, fluidotherapy, and hydrotherapy in a heated pool or warm shower/bath(4) -Cryotherapy can be delivered through ice packs or gel packs -Gentle ROM exercises(1) \u2013Assistive and adaptive equipment(3,4) -Environmental modifications(3,4) -Technology/equipment(3,4) -Home visit if possible(3) \u2013Work-related  interventions -Based on a survey of nurses, doctors, and physiotherapists (N = 73), occupational therapy is the most appropriate profession for addressing work-related  difficulties due to RA. Study authors found that more than 70% of the patients with RA these healthcare professionals treated were of working age. There is a need for more work-related support(31) -Work interventions provided by occupational therapy and the percentage of OTs who provided this intervention included: -provision of solutions for work-based  problems (62%) -applying lifestyle balance skills, including coping and self-management  (61%) -advice on retraining and/or return to work (55%) -customizing condition management skills specifically to match the work tasks of clients (52%) -Authors of a study in the United Kingdomsought to determine the feasibility of conducting a vocational rehabilitation (VR) program to increase job retention in patients with RA, undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis, or psoriatic arthritis(39) -Patients in the control group received usual care for work problems, including an average of 45 minutes of work advice and a written self-help advice booklet -Patients in the experimental group received the same treatment as the control group with the addition of a VR program for 4 weeks. This included topics such as identifying work problems, action planning, developing an individualized program including self-management  at work, job accommodations, employment rights, and a work site visit -Results showed that VR may decrease risk of job loss and improve productivity, confidence managing arthritis at work, physical ability, pain, and perceived health. There were no changes seen in the control group. -This was a feasibility study and due to the low number of participants more research is needed. An RCT currently underway is evaluating this further (the WORKWELL trial) \u2013Education -Patient education -Arthritis education groups can improve the patient\u2019s understanding of the disease and provide essential social and emotional support as group members share common disease-related experiences -Energy-conservation  techniques: pacing oneself and balancing activity with rest breaks(1,3) -Joint protection strategies(1,4) -Respect pain(4) -Maintain muscle strength(4) -Maintain joint ROM, use each joint in its most stable and anatomical/functional plane(4) -Avoid positions of deformity(4) -Use the strongest joints possible for each task(4) -Ensure the correct pattern of movement in activities(4) -Avoid prolonged static positions(4) -Avoid participation in activities that can\u2019t be stopped immediately if they become too stressful(4) -Balance activity with adequate rest(4) -Reduce the force and effort used in all tasks (with assistive devices as needed)(4) -Authors of an RCT (N = 224) evaluated the effectiveness of a self-management  program for joint protection and physical activity in patients with RA. Patients were randomly assigned to either an 8-week  program for  self-management  of joint protection and physical activity (experimental group)or standard care for rheumatology (control)(33) -Self-management  program: Program was based on Bandura\u2019s theory of self-efficacy.  It focused on teaching patients to become aware of behaviors that could promote joint protection and improve physical activity -Compared to the control group, at the 6-month follow-up  patients in the experimental group demonstrated significantly greater improvement in physical functioning, self-efficacy  with respect to pain management, and self-management behaviors -No differences between the two groups were found at the 2- or 3-month  follow-up.  The authors concluded that patients with RA may need a longer duration of self-management  training to incorporate the changes into their life and see noticeable improvements -Family/caregiver education(3) -Authors of a study interviewed 59 patients with RA to understand the influence significant others can have on patients\u2019 participation in everyday life. Conclusions based on the interviews were:(35) -significant others can both facilitate and hinder participation in everyday life -including significant others in the rehabilitation process is important.
