            "WBV and muscle strength/mass, muscle activation and bone mass \u2013Authors of a 2015 RCT in China found that a single session of WBV training has a positive effect on muscle force generation of the quadriceps in persons with incomplete spinal cord injury(19) -Twenty-five  subjects with chronic spinal cord injury were randomized to WBV group (n = 13) or sham group (n = 12) -Frequency and amplitude were 50 Hz and 2mm, respectively -The intervention occurred only one time and consisted of four 45-second  bouts of WBV with a 1-minute  rest period -Post-test  MMT results in the WBV group showed a positive change in isometric force that was 1.12kg greater than that in the sham group \u2013Using WBV training combined with quadriceps strengthening exercises can improve physical functioning and spatiotemporal parameters in patients with knee osteoarthritis(20) -Based on an RCT in China involving 39 patients with medial knee arthritis -Thirty-nine  patients were randomized to the WBV training group with quadriceps strengthening exercise (QSE) or QSE only -Objective measures used in this study included the V AS, Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), TUG, and the 6MWT \u2013An 8-month,  twice a week program of WBV may prevent the loss of quadriceps cross-sectional  area (as measured by MRI) in older adult women(8) -Based on a study conducted in Spain with 37 women who were randomized to the WBV group or a control group (no change in activity) -No changes were seen in functional capacity, handgrip strength, or balance/gait \u2013Authors of a 2015 study(9)of the effects of WBV on bone mass concluded that WBV does not produce osteogenic effects, but another study in 2015 reported increased leg power and bone formation with WBV(10) \u2013Eight months of twice a week exercise training on a WBV platform (20 Hz at 2 mm) did not improve dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) readings in the hips of 37 women (average age = 82) in a study in Spain(9) \u2013Authors of an RCT conducted in the United Kingdom suggest that exercise on a WBV platform, either vertical vibration (28.4 Hz at 1.3 mm) or side-alternating  vibration (29.8 Hz at 2.9 mm), 3 times a week for 12 weeks increased leg power (measured by Nottingham leg extensor power rig) and bone formation (measured by blood sample) when compared to sham WBV(10) -Sixty-one  older adults (average age = 80) referred to outpatient falls prevention service -TUG, functional reach test, chair stand test, four square step test, measure of functional independence (Nottingham extended ADL index), quality of life (SF-36),  fear of falling (falls efficacy scale) and physical activity measures did not significantly improve in WBV groups \u2013Authors of an RCT study in the United States found that WBV training can improve balance and leg strength, reducing the patient\u2019s risk for falls(16) -Sixty adults were randomized to three intervention groups or a control group: bioDensity (bD), whole-body  vibration (WBV), or bD combined with WBV  -Those in the bD group performed exercises once a week for 12 weeks. The sessions were only 5 minutes with participants performing four 5-second  maximal contractions -The WBV group performed two 5-minute  sessions per week for 12 weeks. Patients were asked to stand in a semi-squat position, followed by maintaining a single limb stance for 60 seconds while holding onto the support bar. After 60 seconds, patients were asked to alternate their foot. This continued for 3 minutes during a 5-minute  session. During the first two weeks, the frequency of the WBV was 30 Hz with an amplitude of 1mm. The amplitude progressed to 2mmafter 2 weeks -Strength was assessed using the chest press, leg press, and vertical lift. Static and dynamic standing balance were assessed and the FIM was used to measure mobility, self-care,  communication, and social cognition -The bD + WBV group had similar parameters to those only participating in WBV training \u2013Using low-intensity  WBV(frequency of 20 Hz, amplitude of 0.60 mm, peak acceleration of 0.96g) and high-intensity WBV (frequency of 30 Hz, amplitude of 0.44 mm, peak acceleration of 1.61g) for at least 10 seconds per exercise have been found to increase strength of the biceps femoris and tibialis anterior in patients with stroke(17) -Based on a three-way  repeated-measures  design study in Hong Kong involving 36 patients with chronic stroke -The patients performed three different WBV conditions in a single session: no WBV , low-intensity  WBV (frequency of 20 Hz, amplitude of 0.60mm, acceleration of 0.96g), and high-intensity  WBV (frequency of 30 Hz, amplitude of 0.44mm, acceleration of 1.61g) -Patients performed eight static exercises (standing, sitting, semi-squat  position with knees flexed at 30\u00b0, deep squat position lunges with knees flexed at 90\u00b0, forward weight-shifting  position, backward weight-shifting  position, weight-shifting  side to side, forward lunge position) for three repetitions with the exercises. All exercises on the WBV device were performed for 10 seconds \u2013Researchers in Hong Kong evaluated the effects of adding WBV to exercise in chronic stroke survivors(22) -Thirty-two  participants performed three different exercises on the WBV platform. WBV parameters had varied frequencies (20 Hz, 30 Hz, 40 Hz) and amplitudes (0.8 mm, 1.5 mm), or were performed without vibration -Surface electromyography measured muscle activity in bilateral vastus medialis (VM), medial hamstrings (MH), tibialis anterior (TA), and medial gastrocnemius (MG) -When exercising using WBV , significantly greater muscle activity was noted in the bilateral MG, TA, and MH compared to no WBV -Greater amplitude and frequency resulted in greater augmentation of muscle activation. Aside from the TA, muscle activation was mostly similar on paretic and non-paretic  sides \u2013WBV improves skeletal muscle mass index, physical fitness, and quality of life of older adults (> 65 years) with sarcopenia(23) -Based on a study in Taiwan -Over a 3-month  period, participants had WBV training 3 times a week. Each session included 10 repetitions, 60 seconds each, at a frequency of 12 Hz and amplitude of 3 mm. The repetitions were followed by 30 seconds of rest -Post intervention, statistically significant improvements were found in skeletal muscle mass index, physical fitness standing on one foot, 8-ftup and go test, hand grip strength, 5 times sit-to-stand  tests, shoulder-arm  flexibility, and quality of life \u2013Based on a 2018 systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the effects of resistance training, endurance training, and WBV on lean body mass, muscle strength, and physical performance in older adults, WBV is beneficial for physical performance(25) -Resistance training with WBV was associated with greater physical performance when compared to usual care -WBV did not have significant effects on lean body mass",
            "WBV and balance, functional mobility, and gait \u2013The author of a 2015 systemic review and meta-analysis  of the effect of WBV on balance and functional mobility in older adults concluded that there is some evidence for a positive effect of WBV on selected balance and mobility measures but that its impact is inconclusive(11) -Twenty studies were included in the qualitative analysis, 12 studies included in the quantitative analysis,10 studies included for the meta-analysis on the effect of WBV on TUG, and 3 studies included for the meta-analysis  of the effect of WBV on single leg stance test -Ten trials compared WBV-only  interventions with a control group(usual care or sham WBV) and 10 trials compared WBV-plus-exercise  with exercise-only groups -The author noted a large amount of variation in training protocols  -WBV-plus-exercise  was found to improve TUG and single leg stance but was inconclusive on other measures. Patients who were frail, tended to fall, or attended clinics were noted to have greater improvements when compared to healthy older adults -Further studies are required to determine the exact effect of WBV-only  exposure on balance and functional mobility in older adults \u2013Authors of an RCT in Spain found no added benefit of WBV used in addition to exercise compared to exercise alone. The study compared institutionalized older adults participating in an exercise program on a WBV platform to those participating in an exercise program on a stationary surface(12) -One hundred fifty-nine  residents residing in 10 different nursing homes were randomized to either the WBV-plus-exercise  group or an exercise-only group -Both groups exercised 3 times per week for 6 weeks and performed static and dynamic exercises for balance and strength -WBV platform was set at 30\u201335  Hz with an amplitude of 2\u20134 mm -Similar improvements between groups were seen in the Tinetti test score and 5 times sit-to-stand  test but neither group improved significantly in TUG test \u2013Authors of an RCT evaluating the effects of strength/balance training with and without WBV concluded that WBV did not enhance lower limb strength or balance performance but did improve balance confidence(21) -Based on a study in Hong Kong that included 73 older adults (mean age 82.3 years) \u2013Authors of a 2019 systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that WBV can be effective for improving balance and gait in older adults; however, due to the heterogeneity in interventions and protocol, results should be taken with caution and more research is warranted(1) -Highlights of the data include -WBV is being used for locomotor rehabilitation -There is strong evidence that WBV can be used to improve performance in the timed-up-and-go  test in older adults, but not in patients with multiple sclerosis or post stroke -There is strong evidence that WBV may assist in improving performance in the 10-meter  walk test in older adults and in the 6-minute  walk test in patients post stroke and with knee OA; results are uncertain in patients with COPD \u2013Authors of a systematic review concluded that WBV alone or combined with exercise improves overall balance and muscle strength and increases mobility in older adults(24) -Direct comparison among studies was not possible due to heterogeneity of the research protocols",
            "WBV and falls \u2013In an RCT conducted in Japan, balance exercises, with and without the WBV platform, improved the balance recovery step after simulated forward fall in 20 older women, while WBV-plus-balance-exercises  had the added benefit of improving step velocity and plantar flexor EMG activity (13) -Twenty older women were randomly assigned to either WBV-plus-balance-exercise  group or balance-exercise program. Both programs were focused on increasing step length and improving balance. A home exercise program was also assigned (supervised by nursing home staff), 3 times a week for 12 weeks with each session lasting 30 minutes -Frequency and amplitude were set at 10 Hz and 3 mm, respectively, and progressed to 21 Hz and 7 mm by 12th week -A tether-release  method was used to evaluate balance recovery \u2013An 8-week  WBV side-alternating  program improved all fall-risk factors with moderate to large effect sizes in 18 healthy, community-dwelling  older adults, in a study conducted in the United States(14) -Subjects were asked to stand on platform with knees in 20\u00b0 of flexion and trunk erect. They performed 5 repetitions of 1-minute  vibration (20 Hz and 3 mm)followed by 1 minute of rest, 3 times a week for 8 weeks -Primary outcome measures used included the Berg Balance Scale, TUG, isometric strength on isokinetic dynamometer, chair-rise  test, ROM, cutaneous sensation on foot, bone density, and fear of falling (Falls Efficacy Scale) -Significant results occurred with ROM(larger ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion), reduced plantar sensation thresholds, and decreased scores on the Falls Efficacy Scale \u2013WBV training at 20 Hz without visual feedback can significantly improve balance and lower extremity strength in older adult patients(18) -Based on an RCT in Taiwan -Forty-five  older adult subjects (age = 69.22 \u00b1 3.97) were randomized to the WBV group (n = 14), the visual-feedback-deprived  plus WBV group (VFDWBV) (n = 17), or control group (n = 14)  -The WBV training occurred 3x week for 5 minutes for 3 months. Frequency, duration, and peak acceleration was 20 Hz, 4mm, and 1.5g, respectively. Patients were asked to stand with knees slightly flexed to 20\u00b0 -The VFDWBV group had the same parameters as the WBV training with the exception of being blindfolded throughout the intervention -Both groups had significant improvements on the Limits of Stability Test; however, the VFDWBV group had better results at 3 months and at 6 months (P < 0.001) follow-up  compared to the WBV group",
            "Stochastic resonance WBV (SR-WBV) \u2013Authors of a study of 12 older adults in the Netherlands concluded that SR-WBV  was feasible with good recruitment (i.e., participants who were invited to participate actually enrolled and participated) and compliance and led to improvements on the Expanded Timed Get Up-and-Go test(15)",
