            "Hip injuries in sports account for 3.1% to 8.4%. Labral tears are present in 22\u201355%  of athletes with hip pain(1)",
            "The hip labrum is a fibrocartilaginous structure that attaches to the bony rim of the acetabular socket.(1) The typical labrum is triangular in shape and varies from 1 to 10mm long;it blends inferiorly with the transverse acetabular ligament(1,2)",
            "The primary functions of the hip labrum are shock absorption, joint lubrication, pressure distribution, and joint stability(1,10) \u2013The labrum increases acetabular depth by approximately 20%(1) \u2013The labrum seals the femoral head, limiting joint distraction, rotation, and translation, particularly at the extremes of motion. Authors of an in-vitro  fluoroscopy study found the labrum to act as a secondary stabilizer for external rotation and anterior translation, with the iliofemoral ligament acting as the primary stabilizer(1,10) \u2013Synovial fluid is trapped centrally, creating fluid film lubrication that allows for pressurization of the cartilage interstitial fluid and load distribution(1)",
            "A labral tear is an intraarticular lesion that results from acute trauma or repetitive femoroacetabular impingement (FAI), as in certain activities and sports. Hip labral tear typically occurs in the anterior portion of the labrum. The residual labral flap is unstable, is largely avascular, and has limited ability for self-repair(1)",
            "Labral tears are classified into types A and B(2) \u2013Type A: traumatic injury, triangular \u2013Type B: degenerative, thick and rounded",

            "With a labral injury, the amount of force required to distract and displace the hip is significantly reduced,placing the hip at increased risk for joint instability"

            "Postoperative physical therapy is largely directed by the surgical procedure and individualized physician orders/guidelines, which typically emphasize strengthening muscles to optimize hip joint alignment, stability, and ROM; ergonomic assessment, restricting movement patterns that create shearing force on the labrum; balance and proprioceptive training; and gait reeducation, as may be indicated(16)",
            "Weight-bearing  may be restricted by the physician as part of a conservative approach to treatment(1)",
            "Researchers in the United states concluded that labral repair suture anchors may be able to withstand immediate physiological loads ofweight-bearingafter  surgery.The study was based on 3 cadaveric pelvises with 6 anterior-superior 1.5 cm tears and subsequent 2 suture anchor repair per hip. Simulated axial weight-bearing  was performed and the anchor repair was evaluated by testing load to failure(14)",
            "Activity modification, including restricted weight-bearing  for at least 6 weeks, is usually indicated following surgical procedures",
            "In a single-subject  research design study, conservative treatment of soft tissue therapy, active release technique, stretching, strengthening of the hip external rotators and abductors, improved posterolateral and anteromedial hip pain in patients with labral tears. Hip Outcome Score and V AS improved in all 4 patients treated for 6-8 weeks(17)",
            "Aquatic physical therapy may be incorporated into the patient\u2019s typical physical therapy regimen when significant pain is present with weight-bearing  and ambulation. This can be a part of preoperative or postoperative treatment intervention or as part of the recommended plan of care for conservative management . Problem Goal Intervention Expected Progression Home Program  Pain, discomfort Resolve pain Patient education _ The patient should not pivot on or forcefully rotate the affected extremity _ _ The clinician should address any atypical biomechanical movement patterns with the patient and provide education on the optimal way to complete various motions/activities _ _ Practice ADLs, ergonomic activities, and functional mobility skills with recommended movement patterns and positions to minimize hip joint pain and discomfort.
