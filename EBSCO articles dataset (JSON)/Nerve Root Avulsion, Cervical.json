            "A condition typically involving the compression of a nerve root by a herniated disk, osteophytes, inflammation, or a space-occupying  lesion(17) that reduces the size of the intervertebral foramen. It can also be caused by inflammation of the nerve root due to traction injuries or inflammation of surrounding tissue. The result is pain and motor and/or sensory deficits in the neck and ipsilateral upper extremity that will vary depending on the involved nerve root.(1,2) The average annual age-adjusted  incidence of cervical radiculopathy is 83.2 per 100,000 persons.(16,17) Men are affected more than women and it is most common in the 5th and 6th decades(17)"

            "Many physical therapy interventions have been proposed and utilized in treating patients with cervical radiculopathy. These treatments have included mechanical traction, manual therapy, therapeutic exercise, and pain modalities. However, there is very limited evidence of the effectiveness of specific physical therapy interventions(4) \u2013Results of many nonrandomized studies but few randomized trials have suggested that conservative intervention might be as effective as surgery",
            "Researchers of a 2015 study suggest that manual therapy and exercise are effective in reducing pain and functional limitations related to cervical radiculopathy(17) \u2013Adding manual techniques thought to increase the size of intervertebral foramen showed no additional benefits \u2013Participants showed improvement on NDI, QuickDASH, and numeric pain-rating  scale scores",
            "Authors of a 2016 systematic review of manual therapy in the treatment of cervical radiculopathy reported that there is limited evidence in the literature to support using manual therapy techniques to improve function, increase active ROM, and decrease pain and disability(10) \u2013Four RCTs met inclusion criteria \u2013Manual therapy techniques included muscle energy techniques, non-thrust/thrust  manipulation/mobilization of the cervical and/or thoracic spine, soft tissue mobilization, and neural mobilization \u2013A definitive progression for treating cervical radiculopathy with manual physical therapy has not been developed -High-quality  RCTs are needed to establish protocols",
            "Electrotherapeutic modalities \u2013There are no studies showing the long-term  benefit of electrical stimulation, ultrasound, or TENS for pain control(1) ",
            "Cervical collar \u2013The cervical collar might help decrease nerve root inflammation and decrease muscle spasm. Also, the warmth from wearing the collar might lessen pain(1) \u2013Wearing the collar backwards might help to increase the size of the neuroforamina by promoting flexion of the neck(1) \u2013Use of a cervical collar is not recommended for more than 1\u20132weeks as prolonged immobilization might cause atrophy of the cervical musculature(1)",
            "Cervical traction \u2013Cervical traction for cervical radiculopathy can be effective in reducing pain and improving disability(11,29) \u2013There is inconsistent, high-quality  evidence suggesting that the use of intermittent cervical traction along with strengthening exercises is more effective in decreasing neck pain in patients with cervical radiculopathy versus strength training alone.(31) Additional research is needed to determine long-term  effectiveness \u2013Researchers conducting an RCT in South Korea found that neural mobilization along with mechanical traction may be more effective than traction alone in decreasing pain, increasing function, and improving deep neck flexor muscle endurance(33)",
            "Therapeutic exercises/posture reeducation \u2013Based upon research evidence, stabilization exercise training may be an effective treatment choice for decreasing pain, improving function, and improving posture in patients with cervical radiculopathy(30)",
            "Manipulation \u2013Cervical manipulation has historically not been recommended in patients with cervical radiculopathy.(1) The impetus for this has been the lack of evidence demonstrating efficacy in treating patients with cervical radiculopathy along with documented rare complications(2) \u2013However, researchers of a 2015 systematic review and meta-analysis  found moderate-level  evidence to support the use of cervical spine manipulation in the treatment of patients with cervical radiculopathy(26) -Three RCTs with 502 participants with degenerative cervical radiculopathy were included -Meta-analysis  showed cervical spine manipulation improved V AS pain scores immediately -These studies did not evaluate safety or adverse effects of cervical spine manipulation \u2013Although there is limited evidence that chiropractic manipulation is effective in treating cervical radiculopathy,(12) at this time manipulation is not recommended(2)",
            "Multimodal treatment approach \u2013A combination of manual therapy and therapeutic exercise might be more effective in treating patients with cervical radiculopathy than either intervention alone based on a study in which patients were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups(13) \u2013In 2015, researchers in China conducted an overview of systematic reviews regarding the effect of complementary and alternative medicine(CAM) in cervical radiculopathy(16) -CAM included acupuncture, manual therapy, and cervical spine manipulation -All of the systematic reviews studied showed CAM intervention was superior to control groups -Majority of systematic reviews used low to moderate quality methodology . Problem Goal Intervention Expected Progression Home Program  Cervical pain with or without upper extremity radicular symptomsDecrease pain _ Eliminate or centralize upper extremity symptomsPhysical agents and mechanical modalities _ Cryotherapy and heat packs for short-term pain relief(7) _ Mechanical intermittent cervical traction for reducing pain and disability(3) _ Posture correction _ _"
