            "Epilepsy, the most common neurological condition, affects persons of all ages and is characterized by \u201cpersistent, unprovoked seizures\u201d occurring more than 24 hours apart; two or more seizures are considered persistent.(1,2,34) A seizure occurs when a short but intense surge of electrical activity alters the function of a part of, or all of, the brain.(2) Seizures can last anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes and can have many symptoms, from overt body convulsions to subtle blank staring.(2) The term \u201cictus\u201d is sometimes used as a synonym for \u201cseizure,\u201d and the time period immediately following a seizure is termed \u201cpostictal.\u201d(2) For an individual with an age-dependent epilepsy syndrome, epilepsy is considered resolved if the person is past the applicable age and has been seizure-free  for the last 10 years, having had no seizure medicines for the last 5 years.(34) There are different types of epilepsy and seizures, described below",
            "Types of epilepsy: There are many different syndromes and disease processes that can cause seizures; a patient\u2019s seizures might evolve from one type into another over the course of the disease.(3) The following are descriptions of specific types of epilepsy: \u2013Benign partial epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS): the most common childhood idiopathic epilepsy, with age of onset usually between 3 and 13 years; electroencephalography (EEG) is characterized by high-voltage  focal or multifocal centrotemporal sharp waves, usually followed by slow waves; these spikes seem to be activated by sleep(4) -Prognosis generally is good; however, long-term learning, language, and behavioral deficits might be present(4) -BECTS has been associated with other childhood syndromes, including continuous spike-wave  syndrome, electrical status epilepticus during sleep, acquired epileptic frontal syndrome, Landau-Kleffner syndrome, and early developmental dysphasia(4) -For detailed information on Landau-Kleffner syndrome, see Clinical Review\u2026Landau-Kleffner  Syndrome: Communicative Disorders ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T709047 \u2013Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME): a common epilepsy syndrome marked by onset in the early teenage years; strong genetic component with symptoms such as myoclonic, generalized tonic-clonic,  and absence seizures (see below for seizure descriptions)(4) -Although JME appears to be a lifelong syndrome, symptoms respond favorably to drug treatment \u2013Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE): an epilepsy syndrome characterized by mesial temporal sclerosis (loss of neurons and scarring in the temporal lobe)(4) -Most common form of epilepsy; seizures originate in the temporal lobe(5)  -Incidence of seizures might be significantly lessened or eliminated by temporal lobectomy(4,5) -There also exists a nonmesial temporal lobe epilepsy; patients do not have the same lesions/sclerosis as patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy(5) \u2013Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE): an epilepsy syndrome characterized by paroxysmal arousals (sudden, brief arousals from sleep), hyperkinetic seizures, asymmetric bilateral tonic seizures, and/or epileptic nocturnal wanderings (sleepwalking behaviors)(4)",
            "Types of seizures: There are several different types of seizures. Patients with epilepsy might experience one or more types of seizure(2) \u2013Autonomic seizures: very rare; associated with an change in the autonomic system, such as tachycardia(3) \u2013Dialeptic seizures: a term for a seizure involving loss of consciousness, regardless of the underlying type of epilepsy(3) \u2013Epileptic spasms: tonic and myoclonic features; generally occur between the ages of 3 and 12 months; also referred to as infantile spasms; related to West syndrome; infants who present with these spasms might develop other types of seizures at ages 3\u20135 years(3) \u2013Generalized seizures (affecting the entire brain)(1,2) -Absence: most common in children; very short seizure characterized by a blank stare and brief loss of consciousness; sometimes accompanied by rapid eye blinking and/or chewing movements(2) -Atonic: marked by a sudden loss of muscle tone resulting in a subsequent loss of posture(3) -Tonic-clonic:  also referred to as grand mal seizures; usually associated with loss of consciousness; often begin with an abrupt cry, followed by a fall and rigidity (tonic phase); progress to muscle twitches, shallow or temporarily suspended breathing, and/or alteration in skin color (clonic phase); might involve loss of bladder or bowel control; seizure usually lasts several minutes, followed by confusion and exhaustion(2,3) -Myoclonic: involve sudden jerking movements that usually involve both sides of the body; movements might be very subtle or very blatant(3) -Versive seizures: characterized by continued unnatural turning of the eyes and head to one side; might occur immediately prior to a tonic-clonic seizure(3) \u2013Partial seizures (involving a focal part of the brain)(1,2) -Simple: consciousness generally is unimpaired and seizure might present with motor signs, somatosensory or sensory symptoms (e.g., olfactory hallucinations), autonomic symptoms, or psychic symptoms (i.e., disturbances of higher cortical functions such as speech and language)(1,2) -Akinetic seizures: marked by an incapacity to execute voluntary movements(3) -Aphasic seizures: characterized by an inability to use or comprehend spoken language(3) -Automotor seizures: exemplified by manual and oral automatisms such as chewing, swallowing, lip smacking, or hand movements; occur commonly with temporal lobe epilepsies(3) -Gelastic seizures: seizure characterized by laughing(3) -Hypermotor seizures: seizures are usually short in duration and consciousness is maintained; patient presents with large, violent movements of proximal body segments(3) -Hypomotor seizures: seizure activity that occurs in patients whose state of consciousness cannot be assessed during or after the seizure (such as infants or severely intellectually disabled patients); motor activity is either significantly reduced or completely absent(3) -Complex (similar to simple partial seizures; however, patient loses consciousness and generally has amnesia regarding the event)(1,2) \u2013Nonepileptic seizures (episodic, paroxysmal events that are not related to abnormal electrical activity in the brain)(2) \u2013Status epilepticus: prolonged, repetitive seizure activity that lasts longer than 20 to 30 minutes, during which time the patient is unconscious; status epilepticus is a medical emergency associated with poor functional outcomes; can result in death(2,3)"

The patient experienced ongoing seizure activity throughout the intervention period. Initial language evaluation revealed that the patient had average to high-average  performance on verbal and visual memory tests, mild word-finding  deficits for common nouns, and moderate difficulty with proper-name  retrieval (70% accuracy). The patient also reported problems recalling names in social situations. For treatment stimuli, researchers selected 20 items (famous persons or places) that were familiar to the patient, but not named correctly at baseline; 10 of these items were trained and 10 were used as controls. Treatment  protocol involved 2 hours of training per day for 5 days; all of the stimuli were delivered on a computer screen. For each training picture, the patient was asked to name the item only if he felt confident in his answer. Regardless of whether the patient correctly named the person/place, the therapist then provided verbally semantic features (e.g., \u201cHe is an American actor\u201d), showed two additional picture exemplars of the person/place, provided the patient with the number of target syllables and initial/total sounds in the name, and finally showed the picture along with the written name. The patient was then asked to write and say the name 3 times each. Immediately following the training protocol, the patient was 90\u2013100% accurate naming trained items in probe sessions as well as in the sessions 3 months later.
