Additional high-quality  studies are warranted",

Men had a significant improvement in pain reduction and women showed a significant improvement in depression and fatigue \u2013Pain perception and quality of life was used to assess short- and long-term  effects of spa therapy by researchers in Poland who studied 70 patients aged 60 years and older with OA(13) -Spa treatment was for 15 sessions over a period of 3 weeks consisting of 120\u2013150  minutes per day of physical agent modalities, kinesiotherapy, massage, peloid therapy, crenotherapy, and hydrotherapy with mineral waters -Laitinen scale, V AS, and WHOQOL-BREF  questionnaire reported significant improvements in short-term  (3 months) as well as long-term  (12 month) follow-up -Pain perception was decreased, and quality of life in the domain of social relations and the environment improved \u2013Authors of an RCT conducted in Lithuania compared balneotherapy to music therapy or no therapy at all. The balneotherapy group reported improvements in reducing stress and fatigue. The balneotherapy group received 108\u2009g/L salinity geothermal water baths 5 times per week for 2 weeks(7) \u2013Stress level, systolic blood pressure, state of mood, and subjective relaxation improved when physical activity was combined with balneotherapy(8) -Based on an RCT in Austria of 81 healthy adults who completed four types of 1-hour,  short-term interventions for stress reduction -Participants with high reported stress levels had decreased systolic blood pressure and felt more alert after a combination of walking and balneotherapy \u2013Balneotherapy combined with a psychoeducation program can be an effective treatment method for patients with a benzodiazepine addiction(15)",
