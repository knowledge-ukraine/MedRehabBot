            "As defined by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, cancer-related  fatigue (CRF) is \u201ca distressing, persistent subjective sense of tiredness or exhaustion related to cancer or cancer treatment that is not proportional to recent activity and interferes with usual functioning\u201d (1)",
            "Worldwide, 50% to 90% adults with various types of cancer experience disproportionate fatigue and functional decline each year that impairs all health-relatedQOL  functional domains. CRF begins at diagnosis and typically worsens during treatment. It can persist for months to years after diagnosis (1)",
            "CRF reduces a patient\u2019s ability to participate in cancer treatments and in ADLs, thus reducing overall QOL and potentially overall survival (2)",
            "CRF does not improve with rest and rarely occurs as an isolated symptom. Rather, CRF has a multidimensional nature associated with a cluster of symptoms such as sleep disturbance, pain, and emotional distress (2,3)",
            "In a United States study, researchers found that 45% of cancer survivors report moderate to severe CRF (4)",
            "Moderately strong evidence from systematic reviews with meta-analysis of RCTs supports the use of exercise programs for reducing CRF.(2,4) Authors of a 2017 meta-analysis   (11,525 participants; 78% female; mean age 54 years) found that the evidence was strong enough to recommend exercise as a first-line  intervention for CRF (2)",
            "Patients of all ages and with all types of cancer benefited from physical activity according to the results of the 2017 meta-analysis.  Exercise was more effective when patients were undergoing primary treatment, whereas exercise plus psychological intervention was more effective after primary treatment (2)"

Causes include inflammation, cytokine dysfunction,hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  axis disruption, disruptions in circadian rhythm, serotonin dysregulation, and vagalafferent nerve activation\u2013Peripheral CRF refers to fatigue originating from impairments within the musculoskeletal system such as musclemetabolism dysregulation and problems with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) regulation and production",

            "Central fatigue may be due to failure of the CNS to transmit neuronal impulses. Transmission failure can lead to decreasedability to perform physical or cognitive tasks without the presence of motor weakness or cognitive failure (3)\u2013Alterations in cytokine response, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  axis, circadian rhythm, serotonin, and vagal afferentnerve function are thought to be central factors that can lead to CRF",
            "Peripheral fatigue occurs when a muscle is unable to perform a task despite receiving a stimulus, likely due to deficienciesin ATP or muscle metabolites (3)",
            "CRF is likely driven by a proinflammatory cytokine response. Elevated levels of cytokines can cause a variety of effects,including alterations in muscle function and impairments to the CNS, as they penetrate the blood-brain  barrier (3,4,6)",

Fifty to ninety percent of patients with cancer experience CRF; the higher end of this range represents those whoundergo chemotherapy or radiation(1,3)\u201365% to 100% of patients undergoing radiation therapy experience CRF(7)\u201382% to 96% of patients undergoing chemotherapy report CRF(7)"

            "In a systematic review and meta-analysis  that included 11 RCTs (N = 788), investigators found a clear improvement in CRF as a result of exercise interventions, with a large effect size (4) \u2013Aerobic exercise yielded better results than a combination of aerobic and resistance exercises in patients with CRF \u2013High adherence to interventions leads to larger effect sizes \u2013Effects of interventions were the same for all cancer types",
            "Authors of a 2017 systematic review and indirect-comparisons meta-analysis  who reviewed 245 articles concluded that patients can choose among different types of exercise and nonpharmacological interventions to reduce CRF(22) \u2013Type of physical activity chosen may be influenced by patient preference, contraindications, or cost and availability of exercise equipment or classes \u2013Relaxation is very important during cancer treatment but comes less important after treatment has concluded \u2013The most effective interventions during cancer treatment were relaxation, massage, physical activity combined with cognitive behavioral therapy, and combined aerobic and resistance training \u2013The most effective interventions after cancer treatment were yoga, inspiratory muscle training, combined aerobic and resistance training, and dance",
            "Authors of a systematic review studied the effect of diet interventions, exercise interventions, and a combination of diet and exercise interventions on CRF and QOL in men with prostate cancer(23) \u2013Soy supplements improved QOL in men with prostate cancer but led to adverse events \u2013A combination of healthy diet and aerobic and resistance training reduced CRF in men treated with androgen deprivation therapy \u2013Exercise with or without nutrition therapy reduced CRF and improved QOL for men with prostate cancer  \u2013A lower prevalence of CRF was found in women with breast cancer who consumed a higher-quality  diet compared with those who consumed a lower-quality  diet \u2013Following a combined healthy eating and exercise intervention, reduced CRF symptoms were maintained at 6-month follow-up \u2013Group-based  and structured exercise interventions were more effective than home-based  exercise interventions for improving CRF",
            "Authors of a systematic review of previous systematic reviews with meta-analyses  studied the effects of exercise (aerobic, resistance, or both) on CRF in adults(24) \u2013Authors concluded that there was a lack of certainty around the positive effects of exercise on CRF \u2013However, none of the systematic reviews demonstrated worsening of CRF due to exercise",
            "Authors of a small study (N = 34) studied the effects of aerobic exercise on patients with CRF and found that aerobic exercise had a beneficial impact on CRF (25) \u2013Exercise may protect against proinflammatory cytokines by balancing the ratio of proinflammatory cytokines and anti-inflammatory  cytokines \u2013Exercise may help to reduce sleep disturbances and psychological distress \u2013This study demonstrated that patients can receive positive effects from aerobic exercise during radiation treatments \u2013Resistance training and alternative forms of exercise did not produce a significant decrease in CRF \u2013Aerobic exercise as an intervention significantly increased QOL during and after cancer treatment",
            "Tai chi was shown to reduce CRF in patients with nasopharyngeal cancer compared with usual care. Tai chi was performed for 1 hour, 5 days a week during chemoradiotherapy(26) \u2013Studies have shown that tai chi can improve neuromuscular reaction, lower extremity strength, muscle content, and bone density \u2013In patient with COPD, tai chi was found to improve diaphragm strength, lung function, and exercise capacity \u2013The meditation component of tai chi was found to promote overall well-being,  counteract stress, and improve psychological health",
            "In a systematic review and meta-analysis  researchers studied the effect of community-based  exercise programs on CRF(27) \u2013Many community-based  exercise programs in this study met American College of Sports Medicine recommendations for physical activity \u2013Community-based  exercise programs have a small yet significant effect on CRF \u2013This review states that patients can feel confident that reductions in CRF can be maintained when participating in community-based  programs",
            "Authors of a small study (N = 18 patients with cancer who were hospitalized for radiotherapy or chemotherapy) found that targeting exercise programs to a rating of 4 (of 10) on the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion Scale can lead to an immediate reduction in CRF after exercise therapy in patients with cancer(28)",
            "The exercise prescription should be individualized according to each patient\u2019s health status, functional capacity, preferred type of aerobic activity, and voluntary exertion. In most cases, walking is a safe and enjoyable aerobic activity",
            "The exercise dose (i.e., the intensity, duration, and frequency) should be progressed gradually according to individual patient tolerance, with close monitoring of fatigue and modification of the exercise program as indicated \u203aIt is recommended that patients with cancer achieve 500\u20131000  metabolic equivalents of task (METs) minutes of activity weekly(9)",
            "At least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity  exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity  exercise per week",
            "Exercise should be performed in episodes of at least 10 minutes and spread throughout the week",
            "Adults with chronic conditions should be as active as their condition allows if they are unable to meet the 150-minute recommendation",
            "For increased health benefits, patients with cancer can increase their moderate-intensity  exercise to 300 minutes per week or their vigorous-intensity  exercise to 150 minutes per week \u203aAuthors of an RCT (n = 163 prostate cancer patients, 43 to 90 years of age) found that either impact (bounding, skipping, drop jumping, hopping, and leaping) and resistance training or aerobic and resistance training in university-affiliated  exercise clinics in Australia was effective for reducing CRF and enhancing vitality(16) \u203aIn a systematic review of aquatic therapy for CRF investigators found that aquatic therapy (N = 137) was a safe and feasible way to reduce CRF in patients with breast cancer (29)  .
