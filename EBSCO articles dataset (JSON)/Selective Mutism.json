            "Cognitive behavioral treatment \u2013Contingency management and shaping -Techniques of contingency management and shaping techniques might involve a reinforcement menu that is developed in collaboration with the child. Reinforcement is then provided for approximations of verbal behaviors (e.g., head nodding, mouthing, whispering, pointing) with the eventual goal of speech(4) -Case studies have indicated that contingency management programs are useful in increasing verbalizations, but effects on generalized speech are unclear(4)  -In a single-participant  alternating treatment design study conducted in the United States in which treatment A was child-focused,  exposure-based practice and treatment B was parent-focused contingency management, 9 children were treated for SM(21) -Treatment A involved shaping, modeling, prompting, and in vivo exposure with an established hierarchy of specific situations(21) -Shaping involved humming, vocalizing with the mouth open, mouthing words, whispering words, whispering sentences, and whispering sentences with increasing volume until spontaneous communication was accomplished -Additionally, anxiety-reduction  techniques such as breathing retraining were utilized -Treatment B focused on the parents; parents were taught to reward their children for appropriate speech in public places and punish them for failure to speak in these situations (including loss of toys or TV time)(21) -Therapists established routines for the public situations to increase the opportunities for the child to speak -Teachers were asked to participate in the reward/punishment procedures as well -Positive end-state  situations were achieved for 8 of the 9 participants; based on the data obtained from the study, researchers concluded that both treatment approaches may be effective for increasing audible speech in children with SM; however, treatment A appeared significantly more effective(21) \u2013Stimulus fading -Stimulus fading can be used in conjunction with contingency management and refers to the technique of gradually introducing more persons and places in which speech is rewarded(4) -Stimulus fading interventions have been successful in increasing verbalizations and the variety of communicative contexts in which the child is successful(4) -In a pilot study conducted in Norway, 7 children with SM, ages 3 to 5 years, were treated with a multimodal approach using defocused communication and stimulus fading/sliding-in  technique. The treatment program was initiated in the home and transitioned into kindergarten for a maximum of 6 months. In sessions with the children, therapists used defocused communication techniques which included sitting next to the child rather than across, \u201cthinking aloud\u201d rather than asking direct questions, and giving increased response time for the child rather than answering for the child. After an average of 14 weeks of treatment, 6/7 children spoke in kindergarten settings, which was the goal of the program(34) \u2013Systematic desensitization -Systematic desensitization involves the use of relaxation techniques (e.g., progressive muscle relaxation, imagery exercises) with exposure to successively more anxiety-provoking situations(4) -This technique appears to work better with older versus younger children(4) \u2013Self-modeling -Self-modeling  involves recording or videotaping the child speaking and editing the tapes to depict the child speaking in situations in which he or she has previously remained mute(4) -In single-subject  studies using self-modeling, children have shown improvement immediately after intervention and at follow-up.  However, this technique has been used in conjunction with other behavioral techniques (e.g., positive reinforcement and stimulus fading), and it is difficult to determine the exact effects of self-modeling(4) -Caution: some children are resistant to hearing their voices recorded and taping will actually increase anxiety about speaking(4) \u2013Behavioral language training intervention -This treatment is focused on using behavioral principles to train the child in nonverbal attending, verbal imitation, and functional conversation -In a randomized controlled pilot study conducted in the United States with 21 children with SM ages 4 to 8, researchers found that those children randomized to a 24-week  Integrated Behavior Therapy for Selective Mutism (IBTSM) showed significantly increased functional speaking behavior posttreatment compared to the waitlist control group. 75% of the children in the experimental group met the response criteria immediately following the program. Additionally, the children in the IBTSM group demonstrated significant improvements in the number of words spoken at school compared to baseline and were reported to have significant reductions in social anxiety per parent report (but not per teacher report). Researchers found that these clinical gains were maintained at a3-month follow-up.  The IBTSM program involved a hierarchy of speaking tasks in which positive reinforcement was provided for completing each task. Home assignments such as speaking to a familiar conversational partner in an empty classroom or having a play date with a  classmate in which no talking was expected were also part of the program, and by the end of the intervention the parents were trained to carryout maintenance activities to prevent relapse(27) -In a single-subject  study conducted in the United States, researchers examined the effects of behavioral language training on verbal responses of a child (age 7) with intellectual delay and SM; results indicated an increase in spontaneous verbalizations in both the home and school setting(22) \u2013Social problem-solving  intervention -This intervention involves teaching the child a set of rules to increase child\u2019s ability to 1) identify salient social stimuli; 2) identify the most appropriate social behaviors for the situation; 3) perform the target social behavior; and 4) evaluate the behavior once it is performed(23) -In a multiple baseline study conducted in the United States, two sisters with SM (ages 5 and 7) were given social problem-solving  training sessions 2 times/week in 30-minutes  sessions to increase their ability to answer questions in class(23) -During the sessions, they practiced answering 5 questions that would later be given to them by the teacher in class -During the sessions, the therapist provided a rationale for speaking audibly, reviewed the questions, and gave verbal praise and error correction -At baseline, both subjects answered 0 questions correctly in the classroom; during intervention and in follow-up sessions, they answered all questions correctly in the classroom. However, teachers noted little generalization to interactions with peers outside of the classroom \u2013In a case series with 5 children ages 6 to 11 conducted in Singapore, researchers described a web-based  cognitive behavioral therapy program to treat SM. Researchers modified a Canadian web-based  cognitive behavioral program to be culturally appropriate for the Singaporean children. The program was 14 weeks long with 8 training sessions and 6 practice sessions; parents were given a log-in  and encouraged to practice at home as well. Posttreatment, 4/5 children included in the case series demonstrated improvements in the frequency of speech during therapy sessions at home, in school, and in other social situations(30)",

In addition, the focus on specific targets (e.g., syntactic or literacy concepts) may take attention away from the mutism and possibly facilitate progress(2) \u2013Social/communication-based  intervention -This systematic approach can be used to increase social interactions between the child and peers. Peer interactions can be first encouraged in low-anxiety,  nonverbal interactions that are monitored by parents or teachers. As the child becomes comfortable with these interactions, the verbal demands can be slightly increased. This intervention approach follows principles that are recommended but have not empirically tested by researchers(2)",
            "Other types of treatments showing some evidence of effectiveness are family therapy interventions and multimodal interventions(8,24) \u2013Music therapy has been described in a descriptive case study, but there are no experimental studies investigating its effectiveness(25) \u2013Authors of another case study describe drama therapy with behavioral interventions as a successful treatment in a 5-year-old  girl with SM(26) -In this case study, the child\u2019s speech increased not only in the therapy room but also generalized to non-therapy  settings with both family members and friends(26) \u2013Authors of a case study with a 10-year-old  boy with SM described use of an expressive therapies continuum to treat the child. Initially, sessions began with structured play activities to ensure the child was comfortable with the activities and with the therapist. As the sessions progressed, the therapist introduced play, drama, and art-based  activities (on the expressive therapies continuum) to increase the child\u2019s confidence with self-expression  and reduce anxiety in social situations(29)",
