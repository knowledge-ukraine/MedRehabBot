            "The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , fifth edition (DSM-5 ) classifies vaginismus as \u201cgenito-pelvic  pain disorder/penetration disorder\u201d (GPPD/ PD)(3) \u2013The diagnosis of GPPD/PD merges the diagnoses of vaginismus and dyspareunia into a single condition, rather than distinct diagnostic entities \u2013Vaginismus was previously considered a sexual disorder characterized by vaginal muscle spasm preventing penetration.(1,2) However, vaginal spasm is not universally present(4,5) \u2013The current model considers vaginismus as a multifactorial pain disorder involving physical, psychological, and psychosocial factors",
            "The criteria for a diagnosis of GPPD/PD include the following:(3) \u2013Persistent or recurrent difficulties for at least 6 months with one of more of the following: -Inability to have vaginal intercourse/penetration -Marked vulvovaginal or pelvic pain during vaginal intercourse/penetration attempts -Marked fear or anxiety either about vulvovaginal or pelvic pain or vaginal penetration -Marked tensing or tightening of the PFMs during attempted vaginal penetration \u2013The problem causes clinically significant distress or impairment",
            "Definitions of various female sexual pain disorders(22) \u2013Vaginismus \u2013 involuntary spasm of the perineal and levator ani muscles, hypertonicity, impossibility of penetration, fear of pain \u2013Dyspareunia \u2013genital  pain experienced just before, during, or after sexual intercourse \u2013Vestibulodynia \u2013 severe pain upon touch or attempted vaginal entry, within the vulvar vestibule, physical findings limited to vestibular erythema \u2013Vulvodynia \u2013 chronic pain in the vulvar area of at least 3\u20136 months\u2019 duration",
            "There is an ongoing debate as to whether the grouping of vaginismus and dyspareunia in GPPD/PD is appropriate or helpful when considering treatment(21,22) \u2013Authors argue that lifelong vaginismus (never has been able to experience intercourse) is different from having pain during sexual activity and is considered to have the following components not necessarily similar to other diagnoses(21) -Fear of pain -Pain catastrophizing cognitions and harm avoidance -Disgust and fear of contamination \u2013Canadian researchers comparing 50 women with vaginismus, 50 women with dyspareunia/provoked vestibulodynia (PVD), and 43 controls found that women with  vaginismus had significantly more fear and vaginal muscle tension than women in the other two groups(25) -Subjects of the study participated in a structured interview, pain sensitivity testing, a filmed gynecological examination, and several self-report  measures",
            "Vaginismus is considered to be underreported due to women not discussing it. It is also rarely taught in medical school or in residency training(23) _ clothing and blankets as covering. Progress from pants to shorts,use of sheet to nonuse, as indicated _ _Exercise and relaxation techniques to reduce anxiety and fear regarding insertion should be incorporated into home program.

            "Treatment for vaginismus often includes CBT with or without physical therapy \u2013CBT alone was found to be efficacious but with a small effect in resolving the symptom complex of lifelong vaginismus(18) -Based on a study of 117 women with lifelong vaginismus in the Netherlands -Women were assigned to one of three groups: waiting-list  control, minimal contact therapy consisting of a set of instructional and self-treatment  materials with telephone support, and group CBT combined with instructional materials -Instructional materials included information on treatment of vaginismus, relaxation exercises, and self-help  techniques -Group therapy included 10 2-hour  sessions without partner participation -14% of the treated groups reported having successful intercourse compared to 0% of the control group at the end of treatment period -At 1-year  follow-up,  21% of the group CBT patients reported successful intercourse compared to 15% of the self-help group \u2013Electrical stimulation/biofeedback combined with sexual CBT may be an effective treatment approach for women with vaginismus -Based on a study of 12 women in South Korea(19) -Women were treated with functional electrical stimulation/biofeedback to promote relaxation of the PFMs prior to initiation of CBT -Electric stimulation/biofeedback -Sessions were 15 minutes each and provided once a week for 12 weeks  -Electrical stimulation protocol utilized a pulse width of 2 ms, work schedule of 2 seconds on followed by 4 seconds off, and frequency of 50 Hz. An adjustable power setting was used which ranged from 10 mA to 100 mA -Biofeedback was conducted simultaneously. An EMG surface electrode was applied to the lateral wall of the vagina accompanied by probes that gradually increased in size -Sexual CBT (8-stage  gradual desensitization using vaginal self-dilation  with fingers and vaginal probe insertion) began when vaginal insertion was tolerated, usually around the 4th week -Successful outcome was defined as the ability to engage in sexual intercourse -All 12 women achieved the ability to engage in sexual intercourse -Pain and enjoyment during sexual activities were not reported",
            "Treatment with dilators (or trainers) \u2013Researchers of a qualitative interview study conducted in the United Kingdom found that the practical and emotional demands of using vaginal trainers were often underestimated by healthcare professionals, resulting in inadequate support and information(26) -The women found it difficult to ask for help, to undergo physical examinations, and to deal with medical referrals. They also found it demoralizing to be \u201cin treatment\u201d for vaginismus -A good therapeutic relationship, the value of specialist skills and knowledge, and the need to facilitate couple communication about vaginismus were seen as positive professional support -Peer support among women was also found to be important to successful use of trainers"

        "treatment summary": [
            "Treatment techniques may include the following:(14,17) \u2013Patient education \u2013External and internal manual therapy, including introital (vaginal opening) stretching and pelvic floor techniques \u2013Pelvic floor training, including relaxation and neuromuscular control using exercise and biofeedback",
            "Vaginismus often occurs concomitantly with vulvodynia and/or dyspareunia(5) \u2013Suggested order of treatment is to address the vaginismus component first(13) -Significant overlap exists between treatments for these conditions",
            "A comprehensive physical therapy treatment approach may help reduce the symptoms of lifelong vaginismus(14) \u2013Based on a retrospective chart review of 53 women in Canada; 13 consented to telephone interview \u2013Therapy interventions included patient education (100%), internal manual therapy (100%), modified Kegel exercises (94%), use of dilators (83%), home exercise (self \u2013 98%, with partner \u2013 71%), pelvic floor biofeedback (78%), and electrical stimulation (37%) -Transcutaneous electrical stimulation utilized a low-intensity,  biphasic current delivered by a vaginal sensor -Use of dilators progressed from small to medium to tampons to large dilators -Tolerance to tampon insertion took an average of 10 treatments \u201312 patients dropped out of treatment early due to cost or other reasons \u2013Mean number of treatments for the interview group was 31 (range 14\u201351) \u2013According to the authors, interventions used were similar to those given to women with vulvodynia. More treatments were required to achieve clinical goals for women with vaginismus compared to women with vulvodynia \u2013Some symptoms, such as pain, anxiety/fear, and pelvic floor tension, remained, and scores on the FSDS and FSFI indicated clinical levels of sexual distress and impaired sexual function after treatment. Authors concluded that no linear relationship existed between symptom reduction and sexual function \u2013Patients were satisfied with the physical therapy treatments and found internal manual techniques most effective, followed by patient education, dilatation exercises, and home exercises \u2013Physical therapy was considered an excellent treatment option for vaginismus. Authors concluded that physical therapy intervention should be integrated with sex therapy/CBT \u203aPhysical therapy may help to decrease penetration anxiety(20)",
            "Based on a description of an exercise program designed to prepare a woman for self-touch,  pelvic examination and treatment, and dilator insertion \u2013Therapist uses relaxation techniques (e.g., deep breathing) and environmental setting (patient posture, therapist location, lighting, clothing) to progress the patient towards allowing touch and treatment while maintaining control over the progression  \u2013Author suggests that if the patient is unable to progress to the point of allowing touch it is an indicator that antianxiety medication may be appropriate .
