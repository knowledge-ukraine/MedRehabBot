Cinahl Information Systems, 1509 Wilson Terrace, Glendale, CA 91206Brunel Balance Assessment Indexing Metadata/Description \u2013Reliability -Excellent test-retest  reliability in chronic stroke(1) -Excellent interrater reliability in chronic stroke (100% agreement)(1) \u2013Validity -Excellent and significant correlation with the Motor Assessment Scale (sitting section), Berg Balance Scale, and Rivermead Mobility Index in chronic stroke (0.83, 0.97, and 0.95, respectively)(1) -Predictive validity has been demonstrated in a cross-sectional  study in the United Kingdom involving102 patients admitted to hospital with weakness 2\u20134 weeks post stroke(4) -The patients were assessed using the BBA during admission and the findings were compared to the Barthel Index and Rivermead Mobility Index at 3 months -Initial balance disability, as measured by the BBA, was a strong predictor of function and recovery after stroke(4) \u2013Internal consistency -Excellent internal consistency (Cronbach\u2019s alpha = 0.93) in chronic stroke(1) \u2013Ceiling/floor effects -Floor effects have not been established,(5) but a comparison of the BBA to the BBS and the Mini-BESTest  found that the BBA had ceiling effects in mild stroke but was effective for moderate and severe stroke(7) \u2013Psychometric tests of translated versions of BBA -The Turkish version of the BBA (T-BBA)  was found to be a valid and reliable measure of balance and mobility(8) -The BBA-T  correlated with the BBS (r = 0.879), RMI (r = 0.862), and the Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke Patients (0.847)",

Distance reached is measured \u2013Standing tests(2) -Supported standing\u2014Subject passes if he or she can keep balance for 30 seconds or more with or without support and without assistance from the tester -Standing arm raise\u2014Subject lifts sound arm as many times as possible in 15 seconds. A pass is 3 or more arm lifts -Standing forward reach test\u2014Subject reaches forward \u2265 5 cm without upper limb support or assistance from the tester. If subject reaches less than 5 cm and/or if the subject requires upper limb support or assistance of the tester, the test is considered a fail \u2013Stepping tests(2,3) -Timed step-standing\u2014Subject  keeps his or her balance for at least 30 seconds while standing in a stepping position with the sound foot in front -Walking with an aid\u2014Subject walks 5 meters in 1 minute or less without assistance but may use a walking aid -Weight shift\u2014In a step-standing  position, subject transfers weight on and off the weak leg at least 3 times in 15 seconds -Walking without an aid\u2014Subjects walks 5 meters in 1 minute or less -Tap test\u2014Subject places sound foot on and off a step or block as many times as possible -Step-up  test\u2014Subject steps up onto and off a block or step, leading with weak leg \u2013Standardized instructions and standardized measurement parameters and landmarks are identified in the instruction publication(2)",

It is merely intended as a general informational overview of the subject for the healthcare professional. Cinahl Information Systems, 1509 Wilson Terrace, Glendale, CA 91206Brunel Balance Assessment Indexing Metadata/Description \u2013There are 3 sections to the BBA: sitting, standing, and stepping. The entire scale can be administered at the same time, or it can be administered in sections(6) \u2013Because the scale is hierarchical, testing does not have to start at the beginning, but can start at a level that is reasonable for the specific patient(2,6) -For example, if a patient is ambulatory, it is okay to assume he or she can pass all the sitting tests, so the patient would start with standing or stepping tests -The patient performs each subsequent test in order until he or she gets to the level that is the limit of his or her abilities -If a patient is unable to achieve the identified minimal level for a task within 3 tries, the testing ends  \u2013Sitting tests(2) -Timed supported sitting\u2014Subject passes if he or she can keep balance for 30 or more seconds with upper limb support but without assistance from the tester -Static sitting balance\u2014Subject performs 3 or more lifts of sound arm in 15 seconds -Dynamic sitting balance\u2014The subject is asked to reach forward as far as possible to move to his or her limits of stability within the base of support. Distance reached is measured \u2013Standing tests(2) -Supported standing\u2014Subject passes if he or she can keep balance for 30 seconds or more with or without support and without assistance from the tester -Standing arm raise\u2014Subject lifts sound arm as many times as possible in 15 seconds. A pass is 3 or more arm lifts -Standing forward reach test\u2014Subject reaches forward \u2265 5 cm without upper limb support or assistance from the tester. If subject reaches less than 5 cm and/or if the subject requires upper limb support or assistance of the tester, the test is considered a fail \u2013Stepping tests(2,3) -Timed step-standing\u2014Subject  keeps his or her balance for at least 30 seconds while standing in a stepping position with the sound foot in front -Walking with an aid\u2014Subject walks 5 meters in 1 minute or less without assistance but may use a walking aid -Weight shift\u2014In a step-standing  position, subject transfers weight on and off the weak leg at least 3 times in 15 seconds -Walking without an aid\u2014Subjects walks 5 meters in 1 minute or less -Tap test\u2014Subject places sound foot on and off a step or block as many times as possible -Step-up  test\u2014Subject steps up onto and off a block or step, leading with weak leg \u2013Standardized instructions and standardized measurement parameters and landmarks are identified in the instruction publication(2)",
            "Test scoring/interpretation \u2013An increase in level attained on a repeated test indicates improved functional balance -Progress may also be measured by a change in the objective scores used to determine the level (e.g., distance reached) even when a patient is unable to progress to the next level(2) \u2013G-code  modifiers with associated BBA scores -CH\u201312 -CI\u201310-11 -CJ\u20138-9 -CK\u20136-7 -CL\u20134-5 -CM\u20131-3 -CN\u20130",
