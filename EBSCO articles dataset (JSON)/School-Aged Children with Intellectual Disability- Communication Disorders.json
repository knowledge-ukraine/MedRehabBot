            "Children with intellectual disability (ID) are a heterogeneous group with varying etiologies of primarily neurodevelopmental origin",
            "The terms \u201cglobal developmental delay\u201d and \u201cdevelopmental delay\u201d are often used instead of ID to describe delayed development in children under the age of 5 years but have also been used to describe children older than age 5 years.(1) According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition  (DSM -5), the diagnosis of global developmental delay is only appropriate for children under the age of 5 years who fail to meet expected developmental milestones in several areas of intellectual functioning, but clinical severity level cannot be reliably evaluated during early childhood(2)",
            "Common characteristics among children with ID include deficits in social skills, memory problems, emotional and cognitive deficits, motor deficits, and frequent comorbid psychopathology and challenging behaviors",
            "For individuals who are school-aged  and older, the term \u201cintellectual disability\u201d is now preferred over \u201cmental retardation\u201d by the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (AAIDD). The DSM-5  uses the following criteria for a diagnosis of ID: \u2013Significantly subaverage intellectual functioning confirmed by clinical assessment and individualized, standardized intelligence testing \u2013Deficits or impairments in adaptive functioning \u2013Deficits in intellectual and adaptive functioning that are evident during the \u201cdevelopmental period\u201d",
            "The DSM -5specifies degrees of severity of ID (mild, moderate, severe, profound) based on adaptive functioning, not based on intellectual quotient (IQ), because adaptive functioning determines how much support is needed.(2) According to the DSM -5,adaptive functioning should be assessed with both clinical evaluation and individualized, culturally appropriate, psychometrically sound assessments(2)",
            "The AAIDD classifies severity in terms of support needed for adaptive skills areas (intermittent, limited, extensive, or pervasive support needed)(3)",

Administered as a questionnaire to be completed by parents, teachers, and therapists. Pragmatic functions that are assessed include social convention, attention to self, rejection/ protestation, request for an object, request for action, request for information, comment, choice making, answer, and imitation(22) Designed to identify how the child currently communicates and assist the assessment team in selecting appropriate communication goals. The assessment covers communication skills that would typically occur from 0 to 24 months of age. It can be used for individuals of all ages who are at the earliest stages of communicationMany standardized language tests include separate standardized scores for children with mild ID. However, a review of standardized tests found that many do not include a large normative sample and that most do not measure a student\u2019s pragmatic communication.(23) No tests included students with more severe ID in the normative sample.(23) SLPs should always supplement standardized tests with informal language assessment procedures to assess students\u2019 pragmatic, social, and functional communication abilities. Some standardized tests that provide standardized scores for students with -Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals, 5th ed.

AAC can be aided or unaided. Aided AAC requires external equipment such as picture books/cards, communication boards, or computerized speech-generating  devices. Unaided AAC refers to the use of communication techniques that a person can produce without external resources, such as manual signs, gestures, and facial expressions.(17) Many children use a combination of both types, and AAC can be used in addition to oral language. In a study conducted in Ireland with the families of 178 children with ID to identify the range of technology needs of children with complex needs, researchers found that 35% of parents reported using some type of AAC.(46) The AAC utilized voice-, eye-,  or touch-activated  technology.(46) Patients with very little speech and/or oral language would likely benefit from a referral for an AAC evaluation. The most appropriate model for this assessment is a team assessment with participation and \u2013What type of AAC does the child use? \u2013Is he or she comfortable with the AAC being used? \u2013How long has the child used AAC? \u2013Does AAC improve communicative efforts both receptively and expressively? \u2013If the child does not currently use AAC, an AAC evaluation will include an assessment of his or her ability to understand symbols. The Tangible Symbol Systems Levels of Representation Pre-Test  assesses the child\u2019s ability to match objects with symbols(19) \u2013The SLP and communication assessment team should always consider the cultural, linguistic, and economic background of the family during assessment and when making recommendations regarding AAC use(17) \u2013An ecological inventory is recommended as part of the AAC assessment. In an ecological inventory, the communication behaviors of the child are observed in a particular setting such as the classroom. The child\u2019s communicative behaviors are compared with those of peers to illuminate possible discrepancies. In this way, contexts and activities in which the child\u2019s communication skills can be enhanced are identified(18) \u2013Training in and regular use of AAC for children with communication impairments associated with ID results in increased social communication with peers(59,60) \u2013For detailed information on AAC for children with ID, see Clinical Review\u2026Augmentative and AlternativeChildren with Intellectual Disability ; CINAHL Topic ID Number",

        "diagnosis need for treatment": " Diagnosis/need for treatment Mild ID often goes unrecognized until a child enters school and encounters difficulties in the school setting; when children do not have an identified cause of ID, they should be monitored regularly by a physician because patterns ofatypical development might reveal symptoms of an underlying diagnosis(3) As many as 31 state education departments in the United States require that SLPs consider a child\u2019s IQ score with reference to language performance in determining eligibility for language intervention. This consideration relies on the assumption that language skills cannot improve beyond cognitive ability; however, this assumption, which is based on \u201ccognitive referencing,\u201d has been proven incorrect. At least 2 published studies have indicated that children with cognitive delays made greater gains in response to language intervention than peers who had language deficits and cognitive abilities within the average range. Thus, according to the American Speech-Language-Hearing  Association (ASHA), the cognitive referencing model is inappropriate for determining eligibility for services and prognosis for treatment(31,56)",

            "Milieu teaching (MT) (enhanced milieu treatment):  Features of MT include a) following the child\u2019s attentional lead and establishing joint attention; b) using teaching episodes that are brief, positive, and rewarding and that are included within natural activities that occur throughout the child\u2019s day; c) simultaneous teaching of form (syntax), content (vocabulary), and function (pragmatics); d) targeting general communication forms and function that are on the boundary of the child\u2019s productive communicative competence; and e) using mands (requests), questions, and models to elicit production of targets that are related to the child\u2019s focus of attention.(55)MT is often described in the literature as an intervention for children with developmental delay and disabilities; however, the exact intervention protocols, including frequency and length of sessions, are not well-defined.(55) The effectiveness of MT for improving communication abilities in children with developmental delay is unknown. In a 2012 What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) Intervention Report published by the United States Department of Education, there were many studies found on MT in the literature; however, only one study, from 1991, met the WWC standards to be included as part of the Intervention Report. According to this study, there was no apparent effect of MT on communication abilities.(55) Additional, well-designed  studies are necessary to determine the effectiveness of MT on the communication abilities of children with developmental delay",
            "Responsive-interaction  strategies:  Adult responsiveness to the behavior of a child has been found to be associated with improved outcomes in the child\u2019s cognitive, language, and social-emotional  functioning.(32) Responsive-interaction strategies include following the child\u2019s lead regarding the pace, focus, and content of interactions; responding to the child\u2019s behavior or communication attempts with exaggerated expressions; providing models for slightly more complex behaviors and communicative acts; and taking turns in interactions. Teachers and parents can use these strategies within the contexts of the classroom and home(33)",
            "Non-speech  oral-motor  treatments:  Although oral motor treatment has been used by SLPs for many years, there is no strong empirical evidence to support the use of oral motor exercises such as blowing, lip rounding and retraction, and tongue protrusion to improve speech sound disorders(34)",
            "AAC:  AAC includes manual signs and gestures as well as devices that produce digitized and/or synthesized speech (speech-generating  devices). Research findings support the use of AAC for children with ID to support communication development.(35) AAC has also been shown to be effective in terms of behavior change and generalization for individuals with severe expressive communication impairments.(36) In addition, research has indicated repeatedly that the use of AAC devices does not hinder natural speech development.(35) Furthermore, authors of a systematic review of studies of persons with significant speech impairments reported that many children had an increase in speech production following AAC intervention.(37) Principles of effective AAC intervention are presented in ASHA guidelines regarding the roles and responsibilities of SLPs with AAC: \u2013Family-centered  approaches are recommended(18) \u2013The child should be taught to use AAC with different persons in different settings(18) \u2013The child\u2019s communication partners may have to modify their discourse to converse effectively with the child(18) \u2013Communication partners should have comprehensive instruction on how to use the device(18) \u2013Communication partners should be encouraged to provide many opportunities and reasons for the child to communicate(18) \u2013The child\u2019s use of the device should be monitored regularly in multiple contexts(18) \u2013The child might require an extensive trial (several months) with the device to determine if the device meets his or her communicative needs(18) \u2013The following are some research-based  programs and examples of AAC that may be used for early communicators: -First Things First: A program designed to teach children practical strategies for requesting events, gaining attention, and making choices through use of presymbolic behaviors such as gestures, facial expressions, vocalizations, and/or microswitches(38) -Tangible Symbol Systems: Tangible Symbol Systems is a method of communication that uses concrete rather than abstract symbols and was designed for persons who are unable to understand abstract symbols.(39) The symbols can include objects or pictures (e.g., whole objects, parts of objects, associated objects, textures or shapes, line drawings,  photographs). Information on constructing and using tangible symbols is available from the Oregon Institute on Disability and Development(39) -Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS): PECS is an instructional system for teaching beginning symbol use in which children are taught to exchange, or give, symbols rather than point to symbols(17) -Microswitches: A microswitch is a tool that allows for activation of an electrical device (e.g., device that plays music, device that lights up) by means of pressure applied by a part of the body. A single microswitch or a series of microswitches can allow children to make choices between desired items (e.g., food and drink)(17) -Speech-generating  devices (SGDs): SGDs allow the child to communicate using prerecorded phrases or synthetic speech. Most studies with SGDs and persons with ID have focused on teaching communicative requests. SGDs can also be used for other purposes, including basic social interactions and conversational repairs. There is preliminary research indicating that the use of SGDs has secondary effects, including increased receptive language skills, increased speech production, increased labeling, and decreased problem behavior. Research suggests that SGDs that contain a visual scene display (a drawing, photograph, or scanned image), rather than symbols on a grid, are easier for young children to comprehend(17) -For detailed information on AAC for children with ID, see Clinical Review\u2026Augmentative and Alternative Communication: Children with Intellectual Disability , referenced above",

            "Dialogic reading:  Dialogic reading refers to a set of procedures in which a child and adult share a book together. The procedures vary but always involve prompts given by the adult \u2013One set of prompts spells the word CROWD -Completion: The child is asked to fill in the blank at the end of a sentence -Recall: The adult asks questions about a book that the child has read -Open-ended:  The adult encourages the child to talk about what is happening in the picture (e.g., \u201cWhat do you see here?\u201d; \u201cTell me about this picture\u201d; \u201cWhat is happening?\u201d) -Wh-:  The adult asks wh-questions  about the pictures in the book -Distancing: The adult encourages the child to relate the book to the child\u2019s own experiences \u2013Another set of prompts spells PEER -P: The adult prompts the child to say something about the book -E: The adult evaluates the response -E: The adult expands the child\u2019s response -R: The adult repeats the prompt \u2013There is good evidence that dialogic reading has positive effects on oral language in children with language delays who are \u201cat-risk\u201d  or \u201cow-income;  however, there is less research on dialogic reading with children with ID.(40) One descriptive case study included a 9-year-old  child with CP who used AAC. The study described the child as an active participant in the activity with a total of 168 conversational turns(41) \u2013It is important that the child have the developmental abilities to engage in a dialogic reading task (e.g., attention, comprehension). The SLP should also recognize the impact of any social and cultural influences on the child\u2019s motivation and expectations towards shared book reading(42)",
            "Behaviorally oriented treatment/response prompting and shaping/discrete trial training:  The SLP can be trained in behavioral methods or work with a behavior specialist to provide and instruct teachers or teacher aides in behaviorally oriented treatment. Discrete trial training (DTT) refers to a series of instructional steps that are based on the assumption that behavior is learned and controlled by contingencies in the environment. DTT has been used to teach children skills in all developmental areas, including receptive and expressive language, socialization, pre-academics,  daily living skills, and fine motor skills. There are slight variations in the steps, but there are typically 4\u20135 parts to discrete trial training:(43) \u2013Obtain student attention (e.g., \u201cReady?\u201d) \u2013Discriminative stimulus or cue: The instructor (e.g., SLP, caregiver, behavior specialist) presents a short instruction (e.g., \u201cTouch your ear\u201d)  \u2013Prompt: If necessary, the instructor assists the student in completing the instruction (e.g., guiding hand, modeling correct response). As the child learns, the prompt is gradually faded so that the student responds only to the cue \u2013Response: The student provides the answer to the cue \u2013Consequence: Reinforcement follows correct responses. Reinforcement can include access to toys, verbal praise, sensory stimulation, or edibles. Following an incorrect response, the instructor provides corrective feedback (e.g., \u201cNo\u201d) and withholds reinforcement \u2013Inter-trial  interval: The instructor pauses briefly (1\u20135seconds) before providing the next prompt to ensure that each trial is discrete from the next one",
            "Activity-based  instruction (ABI):  ABI is an instructional approach that combines elements from multiple types of intervention procedures. It is considered a naturalistic, child-directed  approach because of the emphasis on following the child\u2019s lead and interests. The teacher is considered a facilitator rather than a direct instructor. Key components of this intervention include use of routine, planned, child-directed  activities; embedding the child\u2019s goals into a routine activity; using logical antecedents and consequences; and selecting goals that are functional and generative(33)",
            "Social interaction interventions:  For children with moderate to severe ID, opportunities to interact with peers may be limited or restricted in the school setting, so the SLP may be involved in promoting social interaction opportunities as well as increasing the social interaction skills of children with ID.(43) Two ways of addressing social goals are promoting social supportive environments and direct teaching of social skills(44) \u2013Promoting social supportive environments -Supporting participation in general education classes: The SLP may be in a supporting role to provide modifications or assist with AAC so that the child can participate in the general education classroom.(44) Authors of a systematic review of intervention studies focusing on increased participation of children with ID published in 2015 reported on 7 intervention studies (in which only 3 studies were identified that used participation as their principal outcome). These studies provided evidence that individually tailored interventions delivered in both group-based  and individual interventions result in improved participation for children with ID. The group-based  intervention focused on improving social skills in natural environments. Review authors report that additional research is needed to find interventions that specifically target increased participation of children with ID(61) -Arranging peer support: Peer support usually involves a peer who adapts activities and facilitates participation of the student with ID. While providing assistance, the peer receives ongoing feedback from the SLP or other professional involved in monitoring the peer pairing. Peers can also be taught certain roles (e.g., teaching the child a board game) when interacting with a child with ID(44) -Cooperative learning groups: In cooperative learning groups, the class is divided into smaller groups to achieve a specified learning goal. The child with ID is given an opportunity to interact with a smaller group of students to refine and practice interaction skills(44) -Teaching peers how to interact socially with children with ID: There is evidence that training peers to interact socially with classmates with ID may result in more frequent peer interactions and increased social acceptance(44) \u2013Interventions to teach social skills -Teaching social interaction skills alone: There is evidence that systematic instruction in social skills can lead to acquisition of social skills in intervention settings; however, there is less evidence that those skills generalize into other settings or are maintained over time(44) -Teaching self-management  and social interaction skills: In a self-management  approach, students take a more active approach in their social skills intervention by goal setting, self-prompting,  and self-evaluation.  These strategies have been found to enhance generalization and maintenance of social skills(44) -Teaching communication system use and social interaction skills: The SLP may be involved in assisting the child to use AAC devices within social interaction settings by assisting to select systems that meet the child\u2019s interaction needs as well as training peers to interact with someone with an AAC device(44)",
            "Reading intervention:  In the school setting, the special education teacher or reading specialist will most likely be involved in directly teaching reading and writing skills to children with severe ID. However, the SLP may play a supporting role in reading assessment and treatment. Examples of support include: \u2013The SLP can work with a collaborative team in planning literacy instruction. It is recommended that literacy be taught around a thematic unit to provide a more in-depth learning experience for the child. The thematic unit may be linked to the general curriculum or to functional communication (e.g., social language)(45)  \u2013The SLP can also provide assistance in linking the literacy goals to communication goals as specified by the IEP. Examples of activities are pointing or using eye gaze to read vocabulary words, participating in story reading using AAC, following directions to make a recipe, or playing bingo with a grade level vocabulary list(45) .
