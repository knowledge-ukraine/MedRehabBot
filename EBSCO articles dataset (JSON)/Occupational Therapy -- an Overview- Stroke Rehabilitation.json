As the degree of intrinsic recovery will be different for each patient and is generally dictated by stroke severity, adaptive recovery complements intrinsic recovery.(11,12,15) Adaptive recovery involves educating patients in compensatory techniques to increase overall independence and reduce the level of disability created by physical impairments(11,12,15)",
            "Research has shown that incorporating the principles of motor, sensory, cognitive, and affective rehabilitation into task-specific activities (e.g., toileting) is significantly more effective than rote practice (e.g., leg squats)(11,12,15)",
            "There is high-quality  evidence supporting the role of occupational therapy interventions for survivors of stroke;(11,12,15) however, the optimal amount of therapy with respect to minimal and maximal therapy duration and frequency of therapy per week have not been established due to lack of research(12) \u2013Published studies from the Canadian Stroke Best Practices and Quality Advisory Committee recommends the following best practice for physical rehabilitation treatment interventions after a stroke:(11,12,15) -Therapeutic exercises(11,12,15) -Aerobic training -Resistance training -PROM exercise -Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation -Bobath technique (neurodevelopmental technique) -Use of overhead pulley  -Task-oriented  training(11,12,15) -Included recommendations to break down ADL tasks into their component parts; initially practicing the parts separately; and combining the parts to complete the task -Biofeedback(11,12,15,22) -Electromyographic biofeedback (EMG-BFB) -EMG-BFB-relaxation  training -Rhythmic positional biofeedback -Audio and visual biofeedback -Video feedback -Force feedback -For information on biofeedback, see Clinical Review \u2026 Biofeedback ;

CINAHL Topic ID Number: T708952) -Therapeutic ultrasound(11,15,22) -Often used for treatment of pain(11,15,22) -Acupuncture(11,13,15,22) \u2013According to the United States Veterans Health Administration/United States Department of Defense clinical practice guidelines for stroke rehabilitation, there is high-quality  evidence for use of the following treatment techniques in occupational therapy(20) -Level A recommendation (strong recommendation that the clinician provide the intervention to appropriate patients; the net benefit of the intervention is substantial and the quality of evidence is good) -Once the patient is medically stable, rehabilitation should begin as soon as possible after stroke -All poststroke patients should receive ADL training  -Patients should receive cognitive retraining for attention deficits -CIMT is recommended for poststroke patients who have at least 10\u00b0 of extension in two fingers, the thumb, and the wrist -Level B recommendation (recommendation that the clinician provide the intervention to appropriate patients; the net benefit of the intervention is moderate and the quality of evidence is good to fair) -Monitor and maintain shoulder mobility throughout rehabilitation; use FES to the shoulder girdle to reduce shoulder subluxation and decrease pain -Consider combination of FES with mental practice as well as repetitive, intense motor practice -Patients should receive cognitive retraining for unilateral spatial neglect and memory deficits -Use techniques such as cueing, scanning, limb activation, and environmental adaptations and/or aids to improve function of a patient with unilateral spatial neglect -Develop compensatory strategies to improve memory function of poststroke patients who have mild short-term memory deficits -Upper extremity interventions -Robot-assisted  movement therapy to complement traditional therapy for improving overall upper extremity function -Bilateral practice for improving upper extremity functioning \u2013According to the published clinical practice guidelines for stroke management,(11 15,22) there is high-quality  evidence for use of the following treatment techniques in occupational therapy(11 15) -Grade A evidence (\u201cbody of evidence can be trusted to guide practice\u201d) -Rehabilitation therapy should be structured in a way that gives a patient as much practice as possible within the first 6 months following a stroke -Provide CIMT for patients who meet the criteria for treatment -All patients who have had a stroke should be assessed for difficulty with ADLs -Grade B evidence (\u201cbody of evidence can be trusted to guide practice in most situations\u201d) -Provide mobilization as soon as possible once the patient is medically stable -For patients with reduced strength, utilize progressive resistance exercises and/or electrical stimulation -Repetitive task-specific  training and mechanical assisted training to improve upper extremity function -Addition of mental practice to upper extremity training program -Patients with difficulty in ADLs or IADLs should receive task-specific  therapy or training in use of appropriate assistive devices to increase independence and function \u2013National clinical guidelines in Scotland for management of patients with stroke set forth by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network (SIGN) state that a registered OT should be involved in rehabilitation from the acute stage of stroke all the way through outpatient and community care(11,12,15) -According to these guidelines, occupational therapy for poststroke patients should include: -Promoting function though goal-oriented activities -Assessment for and training on adaptive equipment as necessary to increase functional independence -Returning to driving or use of appropriate transport for community mobility -Working with a multidisciplinary team to facilitate transfer of care through the different stages of rehabilitation -Educating both family and patient about stroke and poststroke care -According to the Royal College of Physicians\u2019 National Clinical Guideline for Stroke , occupational therapy for stroke patients may include the following:(27) -Discharge planning for home environment -Goal setting -Training other health professionals, family on proper positioning after stroke -Sensory discrimination training, education on how to take care of limb after sensory loss -Arm reeducation through practiced movements, CIMT, functional tasks -Assessment of risk of contractures due to impaired tone -Repetitive task training -Splinting, as indicated -Assessment for provision of, and training in use of, adaptive equipment to promote safe independence -Screen and refer for driver evaluation -Assessment for visual field deficits and provision of adaptive devices as indicated  -Educating patients for return to leisure/work activities -Assessment and provision of personal and environmental adaptations -Assessment of psychological care needed -Educating patients about fatigue management -Attentional interventions, such as time pressure management, attention process training, repeated practice of activities for patients with impaired attention/concentration -Memory interventions, such as compensatory techniques (e.g., notebooks, diaries, organizers, pager systems, alarm systems) for patients with impaired memory -Interventions aimed at reducing functional impact of neglect, such as visual scanning training, limb activation, sensory stimulation, eye patching, prism wearing, prism adaptation training for patients with impaired spatial awareness -Compensatory techniques for difficulty with executive functioning (e.g., use of self-talk, planners, rehearsal of memory strategies) -Support with community integration and participation \u2013A recent review of human and animal models indicated that the greatest recovery occurs in the first 3 months following a stroke; and this recovery is both spontaneous and due to intensity and type of training (or active motor rehabilitation)(23) \u2013Authors of a 2013 Cochrane systematic review of occupational therapy for care-home  residents with stroke found insufficient evidence to support or refute the efficacy of occupational therapy interventions for improving, restoring, or maintaining independence in ADLs for stroke survivors in care homes. Further research is warranted(43) \u2013In a 2017 RCT, researchers examined the effects of a cognitive strategy known as Cognitive Orientation to daily Occupational Performance (CO-OP)  in persons with hemiparetic stroke. The CO-OP  approach consists of patient-centered activity-based  goal setting that emphasizes global problem solving and application of activity-based learning across multiple environments(24) -Participants were divided into two groups: the control group experienced conventional occupational therapy interventions based on occupational performance, while the experimental group received C0-OP  based interventions. Both intervention trainings lasted for 5 weeks -Outcomes from both groups were measured using the COPM and Performance Quality Rating Scale (PQRS) pre- and post-intervention -This study indicated that the CO-OP  intervention group demonstrated significantly higher COPM and PQRS scores on both trained and non-trained tasks -This suggests that the CO-OP  approach is beneficial to improve occupational performance in persons who are post stroke, and that these results appear to be generalizable to improvement in non-trained tasks(24)",
            "Areas of occupational therapy intervention include: \u2013ADLs/IADLs(2,5,7,11,12,15) -The OT will help the patient select and then train the patient to use assistive devices to increase independence in ADLs(25) -The patient should be actively involved in selecting devices based on personal preferences to ensure the greatest possible compliance with device use(25) -Modifications to the task, equipment, and/or environment can improve ease, safety, and independence with ADLs and IADLs -Allow increased time for patients to complete ADLs; provide patient and caregiver education regarding the need for extended time to complete self-care routines(2,5,7,11,15) -The authors of a 2014 Cochrane review reported that current evidence for the effectiveness of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) for improving ADL performance after stroke is of low to very low quality.(29) There were 15 studies with a total of 455 participants analyzed for the systematic review (which included 6 RCTs that involved a total of 326 participants). tDCS is not used in clinical settings but is currently being investigated in research studies for its effectiveness in improving function in patients with brain damage -For additional information on assessment and treatment of ADLs, see Clinical Review \u2026 Stroke: Activities of Daily Living , referenced above \u2013Upper extremity impairment -Authors of a 2014 Cochrane systematic review of interventions for improving upper limb function after stroke concluded that currently, no high-quality  evidence can be found for any interventions that are used as part of routine  practice, and that evidence is insufficient to allow comparison of the relative effectiveness of interventions. Evidence pertaining to dose is lacking(44) -Authors of a 2016 systematic review reported that a small proportion of total physical therapy and occupational therapy time is directed to upper limb therapy during acute rehabilitation following stroke(45) -Seven studies involving 3236 participants were included -Pooled results indicated that only 7.9 minutes per day (21.4%of therapy time) was devoted to upper limb therapy -This suggests that interventions aimed at improving upper limb recovery may be overlooked in the acute stage, even though evidence suggests early intense rehabilitation is important -Authors of a systematic review found that unilateral upper extremity exercise therapy and bilateral upper extremity exercise therapy were both similarly effective; 9 studies were included in the review with 452 poststroke patients(26) -Researchers in the United States found that use of a structured, task-oriented  rehabilitation program did not significantly improve motor function or recovery beyond an equivalent or lower dose of customary occupational therapy upper extremity rehabilitation(46) -Based on a phase-3  single-blind,  randomized trial involving 361 participants with moderate motor impairment -Participants were recruited from 7 hospitals, predominantly during inpatient rehabilitation -The investigational intervention was a structured, task-oriented  upper extremity motor training program that emphasized purposeful and skilled movement execution in 30 one-hour treatment sessions (3 times per week for 10 weeks) -Prior clinical trials had suggested that higher doses of task-oriented  training are superior to current clinical practice. The authors posit that one explanation for the lack of difference between the groups could be that usual outpatient upper extremity therapy may have evolved over time to resemble the investigational intervention, by following evidence-based  guidelines (i.e., the usual therapy group represented a high standard of practice) -CIMT(22) -Authors of a 2015 Cochrane systematic review that included 42 studies involving 1453 participants concluded that CIMT was associated with limited improvements in motor impairment and motor function but that these benefits did not convincingly reduce disability(47) -This differs from the results of a previous (2009) meta-analysis  that suggested that CIMT might be superior to traditional rehabilitation -For more information on CIMT, see  Clinical Review \u2026 Stroke Rehabilitation: Constraint-Induced  Movement Therapy \u2013 Occupational Therapy ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T709173 -For additional information on assessment and treatment of upper extremity impairment, see  Clinical Review \u2026 Stroke: Upper Extremity , referenced above \u2013Perceptual impairments (management of spatial neglect, agnosia, and apraxia)(11,12) -For information on assessment and treatment of unilateral neglect, see Clinical Review \u2026 Stroke Rehabilitation: Unilateral Neglect , referenced above \u2013Visual impairments -For additional information on assessment and treatment of patients with visual impairments, see  Clinical Review \u2026 Visual Dysfunction: Occupational Therapy , referenced above \u2013Cognitive retraining(13) -Focuses on impairments such as memory, attention, initiation, problem solving, reasoning, and executive functioning(13) -For information on cognitive retraining in survivors of stroke, see  Clinical Review \u2026 Stroke Rehabilitation: Cognitive Deficits \u2013 Occupational Therapy , referenced above .
