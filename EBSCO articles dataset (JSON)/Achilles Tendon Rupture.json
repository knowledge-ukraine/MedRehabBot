Problem Goal Intervention Expected Progression Home Program  At risk for re-rupture Prevention of re-rupture Patient education _ Instruct patient in protecting from re- rupture _ _ Prescription, application of devices and equipment _ Training in use of devices to maintain appropriate weight- bearing statusInstruct in avoidance of overuse or training errors upon return to sport; patient should return to sport only when cleared by physicianFollow through with recommendations at home Postinjury or postsurgical edema and painResolve edema and painPatient education _ Ankle should be elevated as much as practically possible to reduce edema during the first 2 weeks after rupture in both nonoperative and postsurgical patients _ _ Physical agents/ mechanical modalities _ Cryotherapy for reducing pain and edema _ _ Research is lacking on the effectiveness of ultrasound, phonophoresis, or iontophoresis in AT rehabilitationReduced edema and reliance on modalities over timeInstruct patients on protection of the surgical site and weight-bearing status  Adhesions in AT or surgical scar _ _ Tight and stiff AT and calf muscle _ _ Reduced ankle dorsiflexion ROMRecover > 90% of active ROM in ankle plantar flexion and dorsiflexion _ Improved scar mobilityTherapeutic exercises _ Begin with gentle, unresisted active movements soon after surgery and progress with the stage of healing _ _ Stretching calf should be to the point patient feels a noticeable pull, but not pain. Instruct patient not to bounce during a stretch _ _ Manual therapy _ As indicated, passive ROM, stretching, and joint mobilizations may be implemented; scar mobilizationProgress each unique patient as appropriate and indicated; clinicians should follow the guidelines of their clinic/hospital and what is ordered by the patient\u2019s physicianInstruct in appropriate ROM exercises Weakness or atrophy of ankle and lower extremityRecover > 80% of strength in ankle plantar flexion and recover strength of entire lower extremityTherapeutic exercises _ Isometric inversion/ eversion/dorsiflexion at 2 weeks after surgery _ After period of reduced weight-bearing, patient may present with weakness of the entire lower extremityTherapeutic exercises _ Progress to supervised strengthening exercises at 6\u20138 weeks after surgery _ _ Eventually the patient may be progressed to bilateral standing heel raises moving to unilateral standing heel raisesContinue prescribed exercises at home Altered gait mechanics, especially in terminal stance phaseRestore normal gait mechanicsTherapeutic exercises _ Therapeutic strategies such as weight shifting and forced use may be implemented as indicated and appropriateFunctional training _ Progressive partial weight-bearing to full weight-bearing in 6 to 8 weeks after surgery or when ordered by surgeon(4) _ Wean off ambulatory device; gait training to return to normal and symmetrical gaitRecommend complementary exercises for home  Activity restriction (time off work or sport) _ _ Reduced physical performance _ _ Decreased balance and proprioceptionRestore functional capacity for daily activities and/or sports, return to prior level of sport/ activityTherapeutic exercises _ Starting at 4 weeks post injury, try light stationary cycling, water running with flotation device (non- weight-bearing), or swimming for aerobic conditioningTherapeutic exercises _ Specific strengthening, balance, proprioception, agility, and core stabilization exercises for return to sport after 12 weeks without complicationsContinue prescribed exercises at home ."
