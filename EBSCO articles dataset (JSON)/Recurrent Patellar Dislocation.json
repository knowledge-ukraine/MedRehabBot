            "Recurrent patellar dislocation (RPD) is an episodic condition characterized by patellofemoral joint instability that allows the patella to dislocate (laterally in most cases) from the trochlea. RPD is usually caused by direct or indirect trauma that stretches patellar attachments (chronic sprain), rather than habitual activity. However, anatomical factors such as severe trochlear dysplasia, hypermobility, patella alta, patellar tilt, and increased tibial tuberosity to trochlear groove distance may contribute to patellar dislocations(11,20) \u2013Trochlear dysplasia refers to a shallow trochlear groove or intercondylar sulcus(29)",
            "Painful episodes of the knee \u201cgiving-way\u201d  lead to patient apprehension and disability in ADLs Patellar hypermobility may be corrected surgically by repairing injured structures that restrain the patella medially (e.g., medial patellofemoral ligament [MPFL]), releasing tight structures that pull the patella laterally (e.g., lateral retinaculum),(1,2) and autologous chondrocyte implantation for chondral defects that often occur concurrently with patellar dislocations(13)",

Using the Kujala score, patient-reported  outcomes consistently improved over all interventions; the pooled redislocation rate was 31%(28) -There continues to be an overall lack of quality evidence to advocate for one treatment strategy over another \u2013Quadriceps isometric strengthening exercises (\u201cquad sets\u201d), straight-leg raises, and gentle knee ROM exercises can begin soon after acute patella dislocation. The goal of treatment should be to restore neuromusculoskeletal control of the patellofemoral joint at the hip, ankle, knee, and foot(14) \u2013Progressive VMO activation with neuromuscular electric stimulation and reeducation (biofeedback), as needed \u2013Initial treatment may include bracing, immobilization, and manual therapy(14) \u2013In athletes, sport-specific  functional training may begin after bilateral symmetry in lower extremity strength and flexibility is restored",
