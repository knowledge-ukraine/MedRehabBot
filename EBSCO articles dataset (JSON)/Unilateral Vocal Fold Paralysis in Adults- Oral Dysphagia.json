When aspiration occurs with swallowing in patients with UVFP, it is typically the result of reduced airway protection during the swallow.(4) Other factors such as pharyngeal dysfunction can contribute to dysphagia ",

            "Dysphagia refers to difficulty swallowing due to an inability to move food and/or liquid efficiently during the oral, pharyngeal, and/or esophageal phases of swallowing.(5) The oral phase includes sucking, chewing, and moving the food or liquid into the throat. The pharyngeal phase is the initiation of the swallowing reflex, when the food is squeezed down the throat and the airway is closed off to prevent aspiration (food or liquid entering the airway) or choking. In the esophageal phase, the openings at the top and bottom of the esophagus move the food or liquid to the stomach by relaxing and tightening.(6) Symptoms of dysphagia in patients with UVFP are variable and include reduced labial seal, delayed pharyngeal swallow, increased pharyngeal transit time, retention of bolus in the pharynx after the swallow due to a weak pharyngeal swallow, poor passage of the bolus through the upper esophageal sphincter (UES), and diminished cough strength, resulting in less effective airway clearing(7,9) Causes, Pathogenesis, & Risk Factors"

In addition, the laryngeal examination serves to determine the position of the larynx (e.g., high, low) and any other  characteristics of the vocal folds, including vocal fold closure and physical aspects of the folds (e.g., swollen, tense).A mirror examination involves placing a mirror in the back of the patient\u2019s throat. V ocal folds can be visualized by reflecting light down to the larynx(27)Rigid endoscopy is performed with a rigid tube placed into the oral or pharyngeal cavity. A rigid laryngoscope provides the clearest view of the larynx; however, the tongue needs to be held by the examiner and normal speech production cannot be performed during the examination. A flexible laryngoscope uses fiberoptic technology and can be passed through the nose to the back of the throat to examine the larynx during voicing(48)Videostroboscopic examination allows the examiner to see the vocal folds vibrating in slow motion and gives information on any abnormalities present during voice production (e.g., abnormal closure). It is performed with instrumentation used for oral endoscopy or nasendoscopy and is combined with a strobe light correlated to vocal fold vibration.(28) SLPs and ENTs can both perform videostroboscopic examinations of the larynx. The examiner can view aspects of vibratory function such as the mucosal wave, vibratory amplitude, periodicity, and symmetry.(16) Vibratory parameters usually are rated on a Likert scale (e.g., 1\u20135).

Due to its limitations, a CSE should be used as a complement to other instrumental measures rather than in isolation.(29,30) If oral intake is considered relatively safe, the patient should be observed swallowing different consistencies of food during the CSE. Cervical auscultation (the use of a stethoscope to assess swallow sounds and airway sounds) and pulse oximetry (assessment of oxygen saturation)can be added to the CSE -A comprehensive case history and review of medical records(12) -Patient and/or caregiver interview -Assessment of oral structures and motor function. Note the appearance of the oral mucosa (e.g., any inflammation or infection that may affect the oral stage of swallowing) and any pooling of saliva in the oral cavity. An inability to swallow can cause the saliva to pool in the mouth. Evaluate dentition in terms of the presence or absence of dental prostheses, the number and appearance of teeth, level of oral hygiene, and general dental care.(12) Examine the facial, labial, and lingual ROM, speed, and strength. Examine velar elevation -Assessment of speech and vocal quality(12) -Assessment of feeding and mealtime techniques used by patient and caregivers.(12) When possible, conduct the CSE during a regular meal to observe the patient\u2019s coordination of respiration and swallowing in a natural environment.(12) Assess patient\u2019s ability to achieve labial seal and contain bolus. Examine retrieval of different food consistencies from a spoon, cup, and straw(30) -To assess tongue-based  function, hyoid motion, and laryngeal motion during a swallow, place one finger under the patient\u2019s chin at the base of the tongue, the next finger on the hyoid bone, the next finger above the larynx, and the next finger below the larynx. Once your fingers are in place, instruct the patient to swallow and determine presence and extent of laryngeal elevation -Observe the effects of alterations in posture or other compensatory techniques to improve swallow(12) -Evaluate the patient\u2019s ability to comprehend instructions and use compensatory strategies(30) -Evaluate the patient\u2019s salivary function by visual inspection of the oral mucosa, medication review, and medical history review. Note if the patient is taking any medications that may reduce salivary flow, such as anticholinergic,  antidepressant, or antipsychotic drugs.(32) Symptoms of dry mouth include mouth pain, dry tongue, bleeding gums, cracked corners of the mouth, overall dryness (nose, eyes, skin), and badly fitting dentures(32)In-depth  Bedside Swallow Examination (Adults) , referenced aboveA VFSS is performed when the dysphagia team has concerns about the pharyngeal phase of swallowing and the complete swallowing sequence. In addition, a VFSS might be indicated by an otolaryngologist to determine the possible benefit of surgical correction.(9) The patient eats and drinks a variety of liquids and solids mixed with barium while images are recorded with videofluorography. The assessment must be age-appropriate  with regard to positioning, presentation, and viscosity of material.(12) All patients should be examined in the lateral and frontal positions to gain information on movements of the swallow and symmetry of bolus flow and pharyngeal wall contraction. The SLP evaluates for the presence of aspiration and the effectiveness of presenting different food consistencies or of modifying posture.(12) In contrast to the CSE, VFSS provides critical information on the pharyngeal phase of the swallow and can detect silent aspiration.(29) Given the unnatural surroundings, swallowing function observed during a VFSS is not necessarily identical to that at mealtimes. Other variables that influence swallowing function include anxiety, fatigue, and medications.(33) Due to the potential harmful effects of ionizing radiation, a repeat VFSS should be considered only when there are specific questions that require answers from a repeat study; a VFSS should not be used frequently to monitor changes in swallowing. During the VFSS, the following(33) -Lip closure (ability to contain a liquid bolus) -Lingual elevation (the back of the tongue is slightly elevated) -Tongue-to-palatal  seal -Bolus preparation/mastication -Bolus transport/movement of the tongue (movement of the bolus to the back of the oral cavity) -Initiation of the pharyngeal swallow (swallow should be initiated when the bolus reaches the region of the posterior oral cavity) -Soft palate elevation and retraction -Laryngeal elevation -Anterior hyoid excursion -Laryngeal closure -Pharyngeal contraction -Pharyngoesophageal segment opening -Tongue base retraction -Epiglottic inversion -Esophageal clearance -In a study conducted in South Korea of dysphagia in 28 individuals with VFP (not specified if participants had unilateral or bilateral paralysis), researchers found both oral and pharyngeal phase swallowing problems on VFSS -Reduced bolus formation (32.1%) -Incomplete lip closure (21.4%) -Delayed triggering of pharyngeal swallow response (> 60%) -Excessive pyriform sinus residue (> 60%) -Prolonged pharyngeal transit time of thickened liquids (> 60%) -Excessive vallecular residue (75%) -Incomplete laryngeal closure (75%) -Aspiration occurred in 50% of the participants in this study and penetration in 71.4%Modified Barium Swallow (Adults) , referenced aboveFEES is performed to evaluate the anatomy and physiology of the pharynx and the larynx, pharyngeal swallow function, and the patient\u2019s ability to manage secretions and swallow foods and liquids.(12) A FEES is capable of detecting silent aspiration. In addition, it can be used to explore a variety of diagnostic interventions, such as varying bolus consistency, varying  posture, or making use of visual feedback for reinforcement.(34) After the insertion of the endoscope, the patient can engage in normal feeding behavior during the evaluation. Food must be light in color to enhance visibility (e.g., milk, pudding, yogurt, bread). FEES is preferred over VFSS when patients have safety issues related to radiation exposure or when they need retesting. The American Speech-Language-Hearing  Association (ASHA) has published several online documents regarding technical aspects of FEES and the qualifications required to perform FEES(35) -For detailed information on endoscopic assessment of swallowing, see the series of Clinical Reviews on this topic \u2013Scales, surveys, screenings, and checklists are commonly used in the clinical examination as well as during the VFSS to assist the SLP in making decisions regarding the necessity of further examinationStandardized screening survey that can be used with patients from 2 years of age through adulthood. Assesses BMI, restrictions in food textures and viscosity, dependence in feeding, and need for special utensils or positioning. Provides information on the severity of the swallowing disorder and can be used as an outcome measure(36)A tool developed to screen nutrition and swallowing problems in persons with intellectual disabilities. The checklist format allows for caregiver involvement in identifying risks and managing swallowing difficulties(37)A tool to assist the clinician in describing the level of severity (7 levels) of dysphagia and in making recommendations for nutrition, diet, and independence(38)Incorporates the 3-oz water swallow test and a clinical checklist to identify patients at risk for aspiration(39)Includes a pre-assessment  checklist. If the patient passes the checklist, he or she is presented with teaspoon sips of water (3 times) and a half glass of water(40)A screening test for dysphagia in which the patient is asked to drink a specified amount of water in a typical manner. If the patient is able to drink the entire amount without difficulty, no further workup is indicated; however, if the patient has difficulty or exhibits signs of aspiration, additional dysphagia testing should be conducted. Amounts of water greater than 50 mL are associated with higher levels of sensitivity for the WST(5)",
