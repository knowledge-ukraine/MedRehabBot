            "The acromion is a superior bony process on the scapula. A continuation of the scapular spine, the acromion projects laterally and then hooks over the anterior aspect of the humeral head. The acromion articulates with the clavicle to form the acromioclavicular (AC) joint. Muscular attachments are the deltoid and trapezius. Ligamentous attachments are the acromioclavicular and coracoacromial. The acromion is one component of the SSSC, also referred to as the shoulder girdle complex"

            "Acromion fractures have been classified by Kuhn et al.(4) into 5 distinct types\u2013Type I fractures are minimally displaced\u2013Type IA are avulsion fractures and heal rapidly\u2013Type IB fractures result from direct trauma to the extremity and are minimally displaced. Most heal with nonoperativetreatment\u2013Type II fractures are displaced laterally, superiorly, or anteriorly and do not reduce the subacromial space. The majorityare pain free with full motion after 6 weeks of nonoperative treatment\u2013Type III fractures displace the acromion inferiorly, reducing the subacromial space. Patients in this group usually havesustained significant trauma to the involved extremity. Pain and limited ROM secondary to impingement of the rotatorcuff indicate early surgical intervention to lift and fixate the fractured and displaced acromion(2)",
            "The SSSC includes the glenoid process, the coracoid process, the coracoacromial ligament, the distal end of the clavicle,the acromioclavicular joint, and the acromion process. A single failure in the SSSC causes a stable injury. Failure in twoor more places in the SSSC (such as the clavicle and a displaced scapular neck fracture) causes instability or a \u201cfloatingshoulder\u201d(1)"

The anterior os iscartilaginous until 15\u201316  years of age, when the ossification centers appear.

Caution should be taken with contraction of the muscles that insert on the acromion (i.e., deltoid and trapezius)Therapeutic exercises _ Once fracture is healed, joint capsule and ligaments are stable, and ROM is pain free, begin functional activities and isotonic strengthening exercises of the scapula and shoulder. Progress strengthening techniques of eccentric control, rotator cuff, and scapular stabilization. Vary resistance, joint angles, and speed as well as open and closed chain exercisesProvide written home exercises to promote strengthening of the shoulder and upper extremity Decreased ability to perform ADLs, work, or sport with involved upper extremityIndependent with ADLs and return to work/ sportFunctional training _ Simulate functional activities and the environment in which the patient will need to return to (e.g., home, work, sport)Functional training/ return to sport _ Return to noncontact sports may be considered at 6 to 8 weeks. Return to contact sports may occur at 8 to 12 weeks(4)Continue home strengthening exercise program ."
