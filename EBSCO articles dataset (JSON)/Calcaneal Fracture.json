            "Broad classifications of CF: 25% of CFs are extra-articular  while 75% are intra-articular,where  the subtalar joint is damaged/depressed. CFs can also be classified by whether associated fractures and soft tissue injuries of the foot are present(14) \u2013The Sanders classification is used most commonly with CF. (See Pathogenesis below). The Sanders classification considers the presence and extent of subtalar joint fragments/depression",
            "Treatment options range from conservative care for closed, nondisplaced extra-articular CF to surgical reduction with fixation for cases with compromised subtalar joint function. There is not consensus on the best surgical techniques, although there is growing support for less invasive procedures(14)",

            "No rehabilitation guidelines are available for CF. Treatment will vary on an individual basis depending on fracture severity and the physician\u2019s orders",
            "Although physical therapy is not usually started until 6 weeks after surgery, a 2018 RCT conducted in the United States showed that ROM and manual therapy initiated at 2 weeks postoperatively may improve long-term  outcomes and prevent complications(16) \u2013Participants were 50 consecutive patients undergoing operative fixation of a hindfoot fracture (talus or calcaneus) \u2013Outcome measures collected at 3 and 6 months: AOFAS, the LEFS, active ROM, swelling, and pain \u2013Significant differences were found on the AOFAS and the LEFS.
