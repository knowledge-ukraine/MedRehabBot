            "The two primary surgical procedures for end-stage  ankle arthritis or arthropathy are total ankle replacement (TAR) and ankle arthrodesis (AA). Both methods provide symptomatic relief of disabling pain in the talocrural joint(1,3)",
            "There continues to be debate over whether TAR or AA should be the preferred surgery \u2013Advantagesof TAR over AA include conservation of existing preoperative ankle ROM and protection of adjacent and nonadjacent joints(16) \u2013The major disadvantage of TAR over AA is the higher reported complication and reoperation rates(16) -Authors of a 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis compared third-generation TAR implants to AA. Overall complication rates of TAR were 16%, compared to 6% for AA. TAR had a significantly higher reoperation rate than AA(21)",
            "However,continued improvements in implant design, instrumentation for implant alignment, and the use of cementless (bio-ingrowth)  fixation have contributed to better outcomes and the ability to perform TAR in awider variety of patients(3)",
            "Computer-assisted  guidance has improved surgical outcomes of patients with end-stage osteoarthritis (OA) and anatomical deformities. Improved placement of the TAR components may decrease risk of implant failure(12)",
            "These developments have resulted in TAR becoming a promising surgical option for the appropriate type of patient. Between 1998 and 2010 the use of TAR for end-stage  ankle arthritis increased 7-fold(18)",
            "Currently 14 different ankle arthroplastydevices have been approved by the U.S. FDA. Not all of them continue to be used. Common types include INBONE Total Ankle System, INFINITY Ankle Replacement, Salto Talarais and Salto Talaris XT, and Scandinavian Total Ankle Replacement (STAR). Recently developed devices that have been approved by the FDA includeZimmer Trabecular Metal Total Ankle, Vantage Total Ankle System, Cadence Total Ankle Replacement System, and Hintermann Series H2 Total Ankle System(17)",
            "Placement of the TAR implant is commonly made using an anterior surgical approach. The anterior incision allows full access to the distal tibia, tibiotalar joint, and talar dome. However, the anterior tibial artery and the deep and superficial peroneal nerves need to be identified and retracted from the surgical field(1,2,3)",
            "A lateral transfibular approach was trialed in the United States in beginning in 2013. This approach allows visualization of the center of ankle rotation for surgeons to address coronal rotational and sagittal plane deformities  \u2013Authors of a small retrospective study (N = 20 patients with transfibular TAR between 2013 and 2014) found no cases of implant failure, fibular nonunion, or delayed union at 12-months  follow-up(8)"

            "Authors of research in the United States concluded that outpatient total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) was shown to be safe and less costly when compared to inpatient surgery(10) \u2013Based on the medical records of 65 consecutive outpatient TAA patients from 2012 to 2016 with a minimum of 6months follow-up \u2013Overall complication rate was 15.4%;there was one ankle wound infection and no readmissions for pain control",
            "Prognosis of TAR compared to AA \u2013Abnormal gait patterns may not normalize after either TAR or AA.(11)TAR is associated with a more normal vertical ground reaction force curve(5)and increased ROM and gait cadence.(11)Arthrodesis patients walked with decreased sagittal ankle ROM, increased step length, and increased transient force at heel strike(11) \u2013Authors of a systematic review and meta-analysis  assessed changes in gait biomechanics after TAR and AA(16) -17 studies were included -Following TAR, meta-analysis  found moderate evidence that lower extremity biomechanics (lower limb kinematics, kinetics, and spatio-temporal parameters) improved. There was moderate evidence that TAR improves preoperative ROM by 3\u00b0 -Following AA, meta-analysis  found moderate evidence that ankle moment, hip ROM, and walking speed improved \u2013Authors of a systematic review and meta-analysis  compared outcomes of TAR and AA(21) -11 studies were included -The outcome measures evaluated were AOFASscore, V AS, Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale (AOS), gait analysis, ROM, satisfaction, complications, and reoperation  -There was no significant difference between TAR and AA in AOFAS total, AOFAS pain, AOFAS alignment, V AS, AOS total, gait analysis, and satisfaction -TAR patients had significant improvement in AOFAS function and ROM compared to AA patients -TAR patients had significantly higher complication and reoperation rates than AA patients",
            "Short-term  function after TAR \u2013Authors of an observational, population-based  study using California's hospital discharge database between 1995 and 2010 found that the short-term  complication risk for both TAR patients (n = 1,280) and arthrodesis patients (n = 8,491) was low. Patients who received TAR had significantly lower rates of readmission and periprosthetic joint infection/wound infection compared to patients managed with AA(9) \u2013Authors of a study (N = 70) evaluated the correlation of patient-reported  outcome measuresand physical function in patients following TAR. Patients underwent a gait analysis preoperatively and at 1 year following TAR. Correlations were found between patient-reported  outcome measures and gait. Walking speed and ankle push-off  power correlated with patients\u2019 perception of function and improvement. ROM and pain did not correlate with patient-reported  outcome measures(22)",
            "Long-term  function after TAR \u2013Authors of a 2013 systematic review and meta-analysis  of 58 studies (N = 7,942 patients with TAR) found that overall survivorship was 89% at 10 years. The annual failure rate of TAR was 1.2%. Mean AOFAS score improved significantly, from 40 before TAR to 80 at 8.2 years follow-up.  Mean total ROM improved significantly, from 23\u00b0 to 34\u00b0(5) \u2013Authors in the United States of a 15-year  STAR implant survivorship study found that STAR ankles (N = 24) with retention at 9 years were highly likely to survive to 15 years(15) -70.7% of patients had no change on X-ray  prosthetic alignment from immediate postoperative alignment to 15 years -Metal implant survival at 15 years was 73% -52.4% with retained implants required an additional surgical procedure; average time to procedure was 10.2 years"

            "Other factors that can contribute to the inability to maximize functional mobility following TAR include noncompliance with rehabilitation, significant soft tissue compromise, neuromuscular injury, and neuropathy within the involved lower extremity(1)",
            "Conversion of a painful AA to a TAR can be a reasonable option, but whether it is an option will depend on factors determined by the surgeon. If there is no fibula then a conversion to TAR cannot be done(23) \u203aTreatment summary  (1,2)",
            "Evidence-based  guidelines for postoperative rehabilitative care after TAR are lacking. Recommendations for immobilization, initiation and progression of exercises, and WB restrictions vary depending on surgeons\u2019 guidelines. There is a lack of consensus to support whether ROM exercises should be initiated a few days postoperatively or delayed several weeks until there is evidence of bone ingrowth into the implants. Evidence to support early protected motion and other treatments after TAR is also lacking(3)",
            "The duration of immobilization appears to vary based on the type of implant and procedure used. Generally, the ankle is continuously immobilized postoperatively in neutral for approximately 2 to 6 weeks. The duration of immobilization may be extended if soft tissue procedure was required, such as an Achilles tendon lengthening or ligament repair. In TAR without bony fusion or soft tissue repair, the patient may require only 2\u20133 weeks of immobilization or as many as 6 weeks of immobilization after cementless fixation(3,23)",
            "Early ROM may be allowed by the surgeon, but motion usually is restricted in the protective phase (up to 6 weeks)",
