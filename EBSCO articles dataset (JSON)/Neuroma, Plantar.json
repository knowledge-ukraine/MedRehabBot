Longterm  outcomes appear variable(20) Authors of a systematic review found that both steroid injections and sclerosing alcohol injections were more effective to treat MN when ultrasoundguided  injections were used compared to when nonguided injections were used(10) Authors of a study aimed to increase the success rate of ethanol injections to treat patients with MN by using an improved localization technique, a higher dosage, and a higher percentage of ethanol. They found that an injection of 2.5 mL of 70% ethanol under fluoroscopic and electroneurographic guidance achieved a success rate (free of pain in daily life) of more than 82% per single injection(19) Radiofrequency ablation uses lateral heat dissipation from an electrode to destroy peripheral nerve endings. Authors of a retrospective study found a significant reduction in the overall pain score and a high overall success score (95 of 100) after one procedure, which did not require followup  for an average of 34 months(21) Surgery may be indicated when conservative measures fail. Options include excision, decompression via DTML release, or metatarsal shortening osteotomy in conjunction with DTML.(3) Surgical techniques include a dorsal approach, a plantar approach, and distal interdigital approach(18) A dorsal approach is preferred by most surgeons. The advantages of a dorsal approach compared to a plantar approach include the ability to release the DMTL, earlier weightbearing  due to location of incision and the plantar nerves are easier to locate(18) An author of a retrospective study (N = 108) evaluated patients with MN who were treated surgically via an interdigital approach. Excellent and good satisfaction outcomes were achieved in 93.6% of patients. The postoperative complication incidence was 3%. The author believes the minimally invasive distal interdigital approach has advantages over both the dorsal and plantar incision approaches. It allowsfor exposure and excision of the neuroma without DTML resection and without vascular or tendon damage and provided a cosmetic scar (smaller in size and less noticeable). It hassatisfactory outcomes, low complication rates, and enables quick return to normal activities(22)dorsal nerve relocation and dorsal neurectomy. The results were not significant but showed that the dorsal nerve relocation group had slightly better resolution of sensory symptoms and returned to regular footwear and their routine work earlier than the dorsal neurectomy group(23) In a retrospective review of 84 patients who underwent surgical correction for MN with DTML release or metatarsal shortening osteotomy plus DTML release, clinical outcomes were significantly improved in both groups but there was greater improvement in the metatarsal shortening osteotomy with DTML release group(8)",

The experimental group received insoles with retrocapital and longitudinal arch support while the control group received a flat insole of the same material, color, and density(26) -Statistically significant difference between groups in favor of the experimental group was found for walking, in the general health and physical activity domains of the Foot Health Status Questionnaire, in the general Foot Function Index score, and in the functional capacity domain of the SF-35 -The customized insole with metatarsal and arch support relieved walking pain and improved patient-reported  measures of function \u2013Physical therapy: modalities, gastrocnemius and soleus stretching, ankle dorsiflexor and flexor halluces longus strengthening, gait training, orthotic assessment(2,3) -Mechanical diagnosis and therapy (MDT) has been shown to be effective in a small number of case reports. MDT is a classification system utilizing direction-specific  treatment for orthopedic conditions based on mechanical and symptomatic response to repeated end-range  movements. Authors of two studies report a total of four case reports in which MDT therapy was effective. All four patients were first classified into the derangement category and their directional preference was determined. For two of the patients,metatarsophalangeal (MTP) extension relieved their symptoms and they were prescribed MTP extensionexercises. For one patient, MTP flexion relieved her symptoms and she was prescribed MTP flexion exercises. The last patient\u2019s symptoms were relieved by lumbar extension and this patient was prescribed lumbar extension exercises(24,25) -The rapid response of these patients to exercise therapywarrants further studies of larger sample sizes to evaluate the effectiveness of MDTin patients with MN(25)",

Pencil grasps: Use toe flexion to pick up a pencil (or other small object; e.g., marbles, tissues) from the floor, grasped between the toes and the forefoot _ _ Progressive resistive ankle strengthening, BAPS (Biomechanical Ankle Platform System) board. Resisted strengthening can include manual resistance or the use of resistance bands to strengthen dorsiflexion, great- toe extension, plantar flexion, inversion, and eversion _ Strengthen flexor hallucis longus using elastic band _ _ Stretching exercises: To address tightness of surrounding structures that may exist, primarily the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles _ Nerve gliding to mobilize the interdigital nerve: patient places the heel on an elevated platform and then alternately extends the head and neck while dorsiflexing the ankle and toes and then flexes the head and neck while plantarflexing the involved ankle and toes.
