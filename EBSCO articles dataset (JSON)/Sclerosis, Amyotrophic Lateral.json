            "Caregiver burden \u2013Authors of a 2018 systematic review found that informal caregivers of patients with ALS experience caregiver burden that increases as the disease progresses(21) -A total of 25 studies that investigated quantitative relations between patient or caregiver factors and caregiver burden were included in the review -There was high-quality  evidence for a relationship between caregiver burden and behavioral impairments of the patient -Higher caregiver burden was also associated with greater physical impairment of the patient and more depressive feelings of the caregiver -The need to identify caregivers at risk for caregiver burden and to develop interventions to decrease caregiver burden was identified",
            "Airway clearance techniques \u2013Researchers in the United States found that total medical costs, hospitalizations, and pneumonia claims were less after than before initiation of high-frequency  chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) in a group of patients with neuromuscular disease(22) -A total of 426 patients were included. Thirty-seven  percent had motor neuron disease -These findings lend support to the routine use of HFCWO in the care of patients with neuromuscular diseases \u2013Researchers in Brazil concluded that noninvasive ventilation improved chest wall tidal volume, end-inspiratory  volume, and end-expiratory  volume as well as minute ventilation(15) -Based on a case series that involved 9 patients with ALS -Optoelectronic plethysmography was used to examine breathing pattern changes in ALS. Modifications in breathing patterns were observed even in early-stage  patients",

            "Utilizing a structured home-based  exercise program without supervision of a physical therapist may also be feasible to alleviate functional deterioration in patients in early stages of ALS(29) \u2013The structured exercise program consisted of strengthening and stretching exercises for both the upper and lower extremities as well as functional training for ADLs such as sit to stand. Body weight in anti-gravity  positions was used for primary resistance. Frequency and duration were individually set for each patient depending on their physical capabilities"

Participants were randomized to resistance, endurance, or stretching/ROM exercises. After 24 weeks all 3 exercise regimens were found to be safe, with no differences in disease progression between groups(24)",
            "Respiratory training \u2013Authors of a 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis  concluded that respiratory muscle training in ALS can be used as an adjunctive therapy to improve ventilatory function and respiratory strength(16) -The review included 9 RCTs with a total of 194 patients who had either MS or ALS -Respiratory muscle training resulted in improvements in respiratory muscle strength (maximum expiratory pressure/ maximum inspiratory pressure) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) compared to the control group, but the groups did not differ in forced vital capacity or distance walked in 6MWT \u2013Expiratory muscle strength training (EMST) utilizing a handheld, one-way spring-loaded  valve trainer can improve maximum expiratory pressure (MEP) in patients with ALS(30) -Forty-eight  patients with ALSwere randomized to the EMST group or sham group -The EMST group performed expiratory training at home 5 days a week using a handheld one-way  spring-loaded  valve trainer. EMST was performed with the device set to50% of the patient\u2019s MEP. A nose clip was applied in order to prevent air escaping from the nostrils due to nasopharyngeal weakness. Patients were asked to take a deep breath, hold their cheeks lightly, and blow forcefully into the training device for 25 expirations (5 set of 5 repetitions) -Those in the sham group received a sham device that looked similar, but with the internal spring system removed -Results show that the end of the 8-week  study, MEP was significantly improved for those in the EMST group",
            "Treatment of fatigue \u2013Authors of a 2018 Cochrane systematic review of treatment of fatigue in ALS found that there are few randomized studies and the quality of the evidence is very low(25) -One pharmacological study and 3 non-pharmacological  studies (resistance exercise, respiratory exercise, and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation [rTMS]), involving a total of 86 participants, were included -Authors found no clear improvements in fatigue for resistance exercise versus usual care and very low-quality  evidence suggesting possible improvements in fatigue for modafinil treatment versus placebo, respiratory exercise versus a sham intervention, and rTMS versus sham rTMS .
