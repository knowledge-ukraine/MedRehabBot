            "Lymphedema occurs in an extremity when lymph flow is impaired. There is an excessive accumulation of protein-rich  interstitial fluid, usually as a result of an impairment of regional lymphatic drainage. Lymphedema following surgical treatment for breast cancer is considered a secondary form of lymphedema, whereas primary lymphedema involves a congenital malformation that impairs lymph flow.(2) In patients with breast cancer, lymphedema typically develops as a result of surgical treatment, which disrupts lymph channels. Lymphedema can also develop following radiation therapy.(1,2) The reported incidence of breast-cancer-related  lymphedema ranges from 6% to 65% due to lack of standardized diagnostic criteria, variations in assessment tools, and length of follow-up(8)",
            "Lymphedema following surgical treatment for breast cancer is the most common form of lymphedema in the United States and usually occurs within the first year after surgery(11) \u2013Risk factors for the development of lymphedema after surgical treatment for breast cancer include a high BMI, axillary surgery, radiation to breast and/or axilla, and the presence of positive nodes with diagnosis"
