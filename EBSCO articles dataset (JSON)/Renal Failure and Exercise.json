            "Renal dialysis is a common treatment for patients with chronic kidney disease (pwCKD). Dialysis sessions are typically 3 to 4 hours in duration and administered 3 times a week(1)",
            "Most pwCKD receiving renal dialysis are sedentary, have reduced physical functioning in activities of daily living (ADLs) as well as low cardiorespiratory endurance fitness(2,3,18,42)",
            "Functional decline in pwCKD likely begins before renal dialysis treatment due to anemia, muscle wasting, general weakness, and physical inactivity.(3) Exercise prehabilitation (i.e., exercise training in the early stages of chronic kidney failure before starting dialysis) might prevent the decline in physical functioning and reduced physical activity seen in pwCKD receiving dialysis(51)",
            "Comorbidities (e.g., cardiovascular disease [CVD], malnutrition, mental depression) also often contribute to disability in ADLs and reduced health-related  quality of life (HRQoL) in pwCKD(4,5)",
            "Chronic fatigue and lethargy can further debilitate physical functioning and vitality in pwCKD(12)",
            "Frailty and slow gait speed are especially common in older pwCKD(6,34,51)",
            "Daily renal dialysis without exercise training does not improve physical functioning in pwCKD(7)",
            "In contrast, moderately strong evidence supports aerobic exercise training during (intradialysis) or between dialysis sessions for improving peak oxygen uptake (VO 2peak), muscular strength, daily physical functioning, and HRQoL(34,35,43,52,53)",
            "Resistance exercise training during dialysis treatments also appears safe and effective for improving strength, physical functioning, and quality of life,(8,9,10) as well as for reversing skeletal muscle wasting(11)"

            "Aerobic exercise training \u2013Type of activity: Rhythmic movement with the legs (e.g., walking,(28) jogging, or cycling), arms (e.g., upper-body  cycle ergometer), or both legs and arms (e.g., elliptical trainer with arm levers) -Authors of an RCT (n = 26 pwCKD receiving hemodialysis) in Thailand found that thehome-based progressive walking program group increased their lower extremity strength significantly more than the usual-activities  group(28)  -Intradialysis cycling exercise training is safe for selected pwCKD and is associated with improved physical functioning and HRQoL(29,38,39,45,46) -Authors of a 2014 continuing education article provided recommendations for implementing an intradialytic exercise rehabilitation program based on their practical experience in the United Kingdom(45) -Authors of a 2014 systematic review of 24 studies with meta-analysis  (n = 997 pwCKD) found that intradialysis exercise was safe and suggested that a clinical guideline for nephrology practitioners should be updated on the benefits of intradialytic exercise(46) -Authors of a single-group  trial (n = 10) in the Republic of Korea found that a 12-week  program of intradialytic cycling exercise (30 minutes, 3 times per week) did not increase muscle mass or strength in knee extension, even though 6MWT, estimated VO 2peak, and HRQoL improved(47) -Authors of an RCT (n = 18) in France found that a 12-week  program of intradialytic cycling exercise (30 min, 3 times per week) improved plasma isoprostanes (markers of lipid peroxidation) and lipid profile, while improving 6MWT in the exercise group. Body composition did not change in either the exercise group or controls(48) \u2013Intensity -The prescribed exercise training intensity should, if possible, be based on the HR, BP, and RPE responses during maximal, symptom-limited  treadmill or cycle-ergometer  testing(17); otherwise, physical performance tests like the 6MWT should be used(18) -\u201cLight\u201d to \u201csomewhat hard\u201d exertion, equaling 11 to 13 on the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) Test (6to20)(30) -The predicted HR peak based on age should not be used to prescribe target training HRs for pwCKD because their maximal-achievable  HRpeak is often reduced(7,14,15) \u2013Duration: Intradialytic aerobic exercise training sessions are usually 30 min in duration. Physical activities may involve continuous or discontinuous exercise totaling 30 min of physical activity per day. Five hours or more per week may promote losing excess weight(18) \u2013Frequency: 3 alternating days per week during or between dialysis(31) -If done during dialysis, exercise should be done during first half of dialysis treatment; otherwise, should be done on days not in dialysis(18)",

However, the intensity of resistance exercise that is generally effective without compromising safety for most patients varies on a case to case basis similar to aerobic exercise and this emphasizes the importance of individual screening and strength testing(49) \u2013Authors of a 2014 systematic review with meta-analysis  (n = 5 trials) found a small but significant effect of resistance exercise training on increasing muscle mass. However, the authors concluded that only 1 of 9 pwCKD on hemodialysis is likely to receive a clinically important benefit based on their findings(40) \u2013Type of activity: Circuit training.(8,9,10,11) Weight-lifting  exercises using machines or free weights (e.g., leg press, chest press, leg extension, lat pull-down, leg curls, shoulder press, biceps curl, triceps press)(8,9,10,11) \u2013Intensity: Low to moderate intensity.(18) Resistance training at 40-60%  of 1-RM  is used for pwCKD, as in persons with CVD(17,18,19) \u2013Duration: 1-3 sets of 10 repetitions per exercise, taking about 30 min to complete the exercise session, depending on individual fatigue(8,9,10,11,18) \u2013Frequency: 2-3 nonconsecutive days per week(8,9,10,11,18,19)",
