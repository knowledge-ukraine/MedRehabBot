            "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neuromuscular disease characterized by degeneration of motor neurons in the cortex, brainstem, and spinal cord.(1) Symptoms of the disease vary depending on the site of motor neuron involvement. If the disease affects the bulbar and/or spinal systems, dysarthria and dysphagia can result.(1) Both upper and lower motor neuron signs are present as the disease progresses. Symptoms of upper motor neuron involvement include muscle weakness, increased muscle tone (spasticity), hyperreflexia, and pseudobulbar palsy. Symptoms of lower motor neuron involvement include decreased muscle tone (flaccidity), muscle weakness, muscle atrophy, and decreased or absent stretch reflexes(1)"

            "Dysphagia refers to swallowing due to an inability to move food efficiently during the oral, pharyngeal, or esophageal phases of swallowing.(2) The oral phase includes sucking, chewing, and moving the food or liquid into the throat. The pharyngeal phase is the initiation of the swallowing reflex, when the food is squeezed down the throat and the airway is closed off to prevent aspiration (food or liquid entering the airway) or choking. In the esophageal phase, the openings at the top and bottom of the esophagus move the food or liquid to the stomach by relaxing and tightening.(3) The symptoms of oral phase dysphagia in ALS are caused by weakness or reduced coordination of the muscles used for chewing, bolus manipulation, and bolus transfer.(4) Symptoms include drooling (sialorrhea), chewing fatigue, poor bolus manipulation/transfer, and inefficient lip seal. Nasal regurgitation and an impaired nasopharyngeal seal might result from palatal and pharyngeal weakness. Pharyngeal phase difficulties include uncoordinated respiration and swallowing and weakened ability to protect airway(5) Causes, Pathogenesis, & Risk Factors"

However, CSEs are poor at detecting silent aspiration (i.e., aspiration of food or liquid into the lungs without overt signs) or in determining the physiologic reason for a cough or a voice quality change. Due to its limitations, a CSE should be used as a compliment to other instrumental measures rather than in isolation.(21,22) If oral intake is considered relatively safe, the patient should be observed swallowing different consistencies of food during the CSE.(17) Cervical auscultation (the use of a stethoscope to assess swallow sounds and airway sounds) and pulse oximetry (oxygen saturation is measured before, during, and after swallowing; decreased saturation during and after swallowing is reported to be associated with aspiration) can be used during trial swallows to better detect penetration/aspiration at bedside.(16,17) For detailed information on cervical auscultation, see ClinicalCervical Auscultation (Adults) ; CINAHL Topic ID Number -A comprehensive case history and review of medical records(7) -Patient and/or caregiver interview (e.g., \u201cDo you have any problems with eating, drinking, or swallowing?\u201d \u201cWhy do you think you are having problems with swallowing?\u201d \u201cWhat kind of foods do you typically eat?\u201d \u201cAre there any foods that you avoid? Why?\u201d \u201cDo you have frequent choking or coughing?\u201d)(23) -Assessment of oral structures and motor function. Note the appearance of the oral mucosa (e.g., any inflammation or infection that may affect the oral stage of swallowing), and any pooling of saliva in the oral cavity. An inability to swallow can cause the saliva to pool in the mouth. Evaluate dentition in terms of the presence or absence of dental prostheses, the number and appearance of teeth, and general dental care.(7) Examine the facial, labial, and lingual ROM, speed, and strength. Examine velar elevation(5) -Assessment of speech and vocal quality(7) -Assessment of feeding and mealtime techniques used by patient and caregivers.(7) When possible, conduct the CSE during a regular meal to observe the patient\u2019s skills in coordinating respiration and swallowing in a natural environment.(7) Assess patient\u2019s ability to achieve labial seal and contain bolus. Examine retrieval of different food consistencies from a spoon, cup, and straw(5) -Assess the pharyngeal phase by using palpation. To assess tongue-based  function, hyoid motion, and laryngeal motion during a swallow, place one finger under the patient\u2019s chin at the base of the tongue, the next finger on the hyoid bone, the next finger above the larynx, and the next finger below the larynx(5) -Observe patient\u2019s skills in coordination of respiration and swallowing in a natural environment(7) -Observe the effects of alterations in posture or other compensatory techniques to improve swallow(7) -Evaluate the patient\u2019s ability to comprehend instructions and use compensatory strategies(22) -Evaluate the patient\u2019s salivary function by visual inspection of the oral mucosa, medication review, and medical history review. Note if the patient is taking any medications that may reduce salivary flow such as anticholinergic, antidepressant, or antipsychotic drugs.(23) Symptoms of dry mouth include mouth pain, dry tongue, bleeding gums, cracked corners of the mouth, overall dryness (nose, eyes, skin), and badly fitting dentures(22) Several screening protocols have been published to assist the clinician during the CSE;(24) -Burke Dysphagia Screening Test (BDST) -Standardized Swallowing Assessment (SSA) -Bedside Swallowing Assessment (BSA)a 15-item questionnaire that was originally designed and validated for detecting swallowing problems among patients with Parkinson disease, but is also used in other patient populations as well, including those with ALS. A score > 12.5 is a good diagnostic predictor of swallowing impairment in patients with ALS(49)In-depth  Bedside SwallowT709037VFSS is performed in collaboration with a physician (radiologist or physiatrist) and an SLP or occupational therapist and is used primarily as a diagnostic procedure for dysphagia.(7) Most clinical practices follow the protocol originally described by Logemann.(25) The patient eats and drinks a variety of liquids and solids mixed with barium while images are recorded with videofluorography. All patients should be examined in the lateral and frontal positions to gain information on movements of the swallow and symmetry of bolus flow and pharyngeal wall contraction. The SLP examines for the presence of aspiration and the effectiveness of modifying different food consistencies or of modifying posture.(1) In contrast to the CSE, a VFSS provides critical information on the pharyngeal and esophageal phases of the swallow.(17) Due to the levels of radiation involved, this procedure is not suitable to use frequently to monitor changes.(21) Given the unnatural surroundings, swallowing function observed during a VFSS is not necessarily identical to swallowing function displayed at mealtimes.(24) Other variables that can influence swallowing function include anxiety, fatigue, and medications.(26) Several generic scales have been developed to rate the findings of a VFSS in terms of severity and have been found to be appropriate for use with patients with ALS.(11) During the VFSS, the patient\u2019s overall pace of eating is observed, as well(22,26) -Lip closure (ability to contain a liquid bolus) -Lingual elevation (the back of the tongue is slightly elevated) -Tongue-to-palatal  seal -Bolus preparation/mastication -Bolus transport/movement of the tongue (movement of the bolus to the back of the oral cavity) -Initiation of the pharyngeal swallow (swallow should be initiated when the bolus reaches the region of the posterior oral cavity) -Soft palate elevation and retraction -Laryngeal elevation -Anterior hyoid excursion -Laryngeal closure -Pharyngeal contraction -Pharyngoesophageal segment opening -Tongue base retraction -Epiglottic inversion -Esophageal clearanceModified Barium SwallowT709046FEES is performed to evaluate the anatomy and physiology of the pharynx and the larynx, pharyngeal swallow function, the patient\u2019s ability to manage secretions as well as the ability to swallow foods and liquids.(7) In addition, it can be used to explore a variety of diagnostic interventions such as varying bolus consistency, varying posture, or making use of visual feedback for reinforcement.(27) After the insertion of the endoscope, the patient can self-feed  during the evaluation. Food must be light in color to enhance visibility (e.g., milk, puddings, yogurt, bread). FEES is preferred over VFSS when patients have safety issues related to radiation exposure and when individuals need retesting. In addition, FEES is often less taxing than VFSS for patients who are weak and bedridden.(27)The FEES has the advantage (over the VFSS)  of allowing the clinician to observe the pharyngeal and laryngeal structures pre-swallow;  this is especially important for patients with ALS who often exhibit pooled secretions in the larynx, pharynx, or trachea prior to having any food or liquid introduced into their system.(38) The American Speech-Language-Hearing  Association (ASHA) has published several online documents relevant to the technical aspects of FEES and the qualifications required to perform FEES.(28)Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation ofT709038 \u2013Other instrumental procedures include ultrasonography to observe movement of the structures used for swallowing and surface electromyography to record the electrical activity of the swallowing muscles; however, these procedures are used primarily in research at this time.(7) Bronchial auscultation by a physical therapist has also been used as an adjunct to a bedside assessment(29)",

            "Diet modification:  Changing the food and/or liquid consistency of a patient\u2019s diet may assist in improving the safety and efficiency of the swallow as well as reduce fatigue associated with eating. For example, if a patient reports fatigue while chewing, food may be cut into small bites and the diet can be changed to include more moist foods or foods with a mechanical soft texture.(4,5) Pills can be placed, whole or crushed, into pureed food to improve oral control and to assist in swallowing. In the later stages of the disease, severely impaired lingual movement may hinder mastication and patients may need to restrict diet to liquids and pureed foods.(5) If the patient reports aspiration of liquids or difficulty containing the liquid in the oral cavity, the clinician may investigate the used of thickened liquids; however, it cannot be assumed that all patients benefit from thickened liquids.(31) Clinicians should explore all possible intervention options before recommending thickened liquids, and also confirm (by observing modifications during VFSS), rather than assume, that aspiration is not occurring with thickened liquids(32) \u2013For detailed information on diet modifications for dysphagia treatment, see Clinical Review\u2026Dysphagia: Swallowing Therapy \u2013 Compensatory ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T709081",
            "Postural therapy:  Several postures have been examined to assist in changing the direction of the flow of foods and liquids for patients with dysphagia, including the chin tuck, head back, head rotation, and head tilt. For patients with ALS, the chin tuck (chin down) may be used to compensate for reduced posterior motion of the base of the tongue. In addition, the chin tuck widens the valleculae so that they can more easily capture the bolus during a delay in the pharyngeal swallow and prevent aspiration before swallowing.(31) Patients with cognitive difficulties may need auditory or visual cues to remember to use postural strategies during mealtimes \u2013For detailed information on postural changes as dysphagia treatment, see Clinical Review\u2026Dysphagia: Swallowing Therapy \u2013 Compensatory , referenced above",
            "Sensory stimuli:  Changing the taste, volume, temperature, or carbonation of the food or liquid has been used as a way to heighten sensation and assist with delayed oral onset and/or delayed pharyngeal swallow.(4) More research is needed to validate these techniques to determine their effects on a variety of different types of patients(31) \u2013In a study conducted in Italy, researchers found that adding flavor to liquid thickeners subjectively and objectively improved swallowing function in a group of 20 patients with ALS.(49) Patients were initially asked to swallow neutral thickeners for a period of 6 weeks. At the follow-up  visit 6 weeks after the start of the study, patients were asked to taste 5 thickened drinks: sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and fat (liquid cream). The patients each selected a preferred thickener flavor from the 5 options and used this thickener for the following 6-week period. At the initial baseline and at the final visit (after the second 6-week  period), patients filled out the SDQ as an objective measure of swallowing ability. Researchers  used question #10 on the SDQ, which asks about swallowing liquids, to measure improvement. Overall, there was significant improvement in question #10 from the first to third visit, after the patients used the flavored thickener(49) \u2013For detailed information on changes to sensory aspects of the bolus for dysphagia treatment, see Clinical Review\u2026 Dysphagia: Swallowing Therapy \u2013Compensatory , referenced above",
            "Swallow maneuvers (voluntary changes in the swallow):  Swallow maneuvers include the supraglottic swallow, the super-supraglottic  swallow, the effortful swallow, and the Mendelsohn maneuver. Research has documented specific changes in the oropharyngeal swallow due to these maneuvers for some patients; however, further research is needed to determine the amount of time that these maneuvers should be used. Patients might not be able to perform maneuvers if they are unable to follow instructions or remember to use the maneuver during each swallow. These maneuvers might not be effective for patients with ALS who fatigue easily. There is insufficient evidence to provide any clear guidelines on the use of rehabilitative exercises in dysphagia therapy for patients with ALS.(38)In most cases, the use of repetitive exercise as a rehabilitative technique is contraindicated for patients with ALS \u2013Supraglottic swallow: Breath is held before, during, and after the swallow so that the true vocal folds are closed.(31) This technique might be contraindicated for patients with ALS who have disturbed respiratory function(32) \u2013Super-supraglottic  swallow: Breath is held while the patient also swallows with extra effort.(31) This technique might be contraindicated for patients with ALS who have disturbed respiratory function(32) \u2013Effortful swallow: Patient contracts the muscles involved in swallowing with great effort.(31) This strategy might be too fatiguing for the patient with ALS(14) \u2013Mendelsohn maneuver: The Mendelsohn maneuver is designed to increase the movement of the larynx and hyoid during the pharyngeal swallow. The patient holds the larynx up by using the muscles of the neck or with the hand. This strategy might be too fatiguing for the patient with ALS(14) \u2013For detailed information on maneuvers in dysphagia treatment, see Clinical Review\u2026Dysphagia: Swallowing Therapy \u2013Swallow Maneuvers \u2013 an Overview ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T709042and the series of Clinical Reviews on each specific maneuver",
            "Adaptive equipment:  Adaptive spoons, cups, and straws can be used to assist with the oral stage of the swallow. For example, if the patient has difficulty achieving a labial seal and cannot drink from a straw, a nonspill cup with a large handle may be useful as a facilitative aid. If anterior leakage continues, spoons can be used to place the liquid more posterior in the mouth.(5) A nonskid mat can stabilize objects on the table(5)",
            "Feeding tubes/enteral feeding:  Patients with advanced ALS are often unable to take adequate nutrition and hydration by mouth and might require a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube (PEG) or a radiologically inserted gastrostomy tube.(10)Tube feeding is indicated in patients who cannot eat or drink enough to maintain sufficient weight and hydration. Malnutrition has a negative impact on both survival and quality of life in patients with ALS.(36) When speaking to the family about enteral feeding, it is important to emphasize that the patient can continue to eat for pleasure; the patient and family must be made aware of the aspiration risk (low versus high) and decide if the benefits of pleasure feeding outweigh the risk of aspiration. The decision to continue to eat by mouth with a high risk of aspiration in the face of a terminal illness is a very personal decision, and each patient will differ in his or her approach to this situation. For patients with ALS, it is advised that tube placement occur before vital capacity (as measured in a seating position) drops below 50%(14,36)",
