The single tendon transfer involved transfer of the TP tendon, whereas the double tendon transfer involved the transfer of the TP tendon and the FDL tendon to the extensor digitorum longus and extensor hallucis longus tendon. The double tendon transfer goal was to help avoid toe drop following surgery(13) -Foot drop and AROM were comparable between the two groups -Prevention of toe drop and active toe extension were significantly greater in the double tendon transfer group. However, not all patients in this group regained active toe extension (only 8 of 14 patients) -More studies are needed to determine if double tendon transfer produces better functional outcomes than single tendon transfer \u2013Authors of a study (N = 20) after TP tendon transfer for patients with foot drop for greater than 1 year found at a 2-year follow-up  that all but one patient could walk with a heel-toe  gait without any orthotic support(14)  -19 of 20 patients had a mean active dorsiflexion (DF) of 7.5\u00b0, active PF of 36.25\u00b0, and active DF of the toes ranged from 5 to 20\u00b0 \u2013Authors of a 2017 retrospective study in Korea found that an anterior transfer of TP tendon can be an effective treatment option for individuals with foot drop due to peroneal nerve palsy(11)",

Overcorrection of equinovarus is a potential complication of this surgery \u2013The new modified SPOTT additionally takes the remaining half of the TP tendon and elongates it to reduce its strength and lower the risk of the overcorrection and resulting foot deformity \u2013The new modified SPOTT procedure is a safe technique and compared to the standard SPOTT showed significantly better surgical outcomes",

            "Generally, the treated foot will be placed in a splint for 1\u20132 weeks until sutures are removed. Then the foot/leg will be immobilized in a non-WB  plaster cast or removable boot for up to 6 weeks. Initial treatment will include pain management with cryotherapy \u2013TP tendon transfer procedures for foot drop often require non-WB  instructions and castimmobilization for 6 weeks. Authors of a study (N = 24 cadaveric ankles) investigated whether early active DF and protected WB could be safe(17) -The risks of early rehabilitation included tendon slippage at insertion site, increased tendon length, muscle atrophy and weakness, and recurrent foot deformity -Pulvertaft weave (PW) technique and interference screw fixation (ISF)were compared -The TP tendons in cadaveric ankles were cycled 1000 times at 50\u2013150  N and then were loaded to failure. Tendon displacement at the insertion site was measured (> 5 mm is considered failure) -Mean tendon displacement was similar in the PW group (2.9 \u00b12.5 mm) compared to the ISF group (2.4 \u00b1 1.1 mm) -Early postoperative active DF and early protected partial WB for TP tendon transfers may have potential benefits, including improved patient satisfaction, decreased stiffness, and decreased risk for venous thromboembolism. PW and ISF groups were comparable. The greater variability in the PW group suggest it may be a less reliable technique, but more research is needed",
            "Early mobilization of stiff joints should focus on coordination of movement (motor control) and isometric strengthening while avoiding full ROM exercise in order not to overstretch the transferred tendon",
            "Light isotonic exercises may be implemented at about 6 weeks postoperative. The progression to protected full WB without the cast or removable boot and initial resistance training to restore foot and ankle strength may start at 8 weeks after surgery",
            "Balance training and full ROM exercises can usually be implemented along with full WB",
            "Functional deficits in posture and gait should be addressed as indicated",
            "An independent home exercise program can be prescribed as appropriate",

For example, towel/pencil curling to strengthen foot intrinsic muscles _ _ Towel curling: starting at one edge of the towel, gradually pull the towel toward you until you reach the other end of the towel, using your toes only to advance the towel _ _ Pencil curling: Use toe flexion to pick up a pencil from the floor, grasped between the toes and the forefoot (marbles, jacks, or other small objects may also be used) _ _ Progressive resistive ankle strengthening post NWB (e.g., manual resistance, elastic band to strengthen dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, inversion, and eversion; ankle board) _ _ Address tightness of ankle/foot (e.g., use a long towel or strap to passively stretch Achilles tendon; tennis ball under the foot to massage the plantar fascia). _ When FWB, lower- body cardiovascular exercise (e.g., bike or elliptical trainer)Progress intensity and duration of exercises as appropriateProvide patient and family/caregivers with written instructions regarding therapeutic activities that can be performed at home and correct use and/ or application of equipment  ."
