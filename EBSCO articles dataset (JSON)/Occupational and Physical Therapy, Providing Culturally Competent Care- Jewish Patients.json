            "The intent of this Clinical Review is to provide a general profile of Jewish patients across a wide range of dimensions and to help guide physical therapy and occupational therapy evaluation and treatment sessions for Jewish patients",
            "Being Jewish means belonging to a culture and a religion, but not a specific race(1)",
            "Judaism is the religion of Jewish people(1) \u2013Regardless of their country of origin, many Jews around the world consider the State of Israel to be a second homeland, especially because The Law of Return  entitles every Jew the right to immigrate to Israel -Israel is a small, westernized country located in the Middle East. It is situated along the eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea and is bordered by Lebanon to the north, Syria to the northeast, Jordan and the West Bank to the east, and Egypt and the Gaza Strip to the south(2) -The State of Israel was established in 1948 following the arrival of hundreds of thousands of Jews, many of whom had fled post-revolutionary  Russia or escaped Nazi rule in Europe(2) \u2013Hebrew is the official language of the State of Israel and is used for all Jewish prayers; however, Hebrew is not typically the first language of Jews(1)",
            "There are several different branches of Judaism, each with its own set of expectations, practices, and customs(1) \u2013Orthodox: traditional; members attempt to adhere to most of the religious laws of Judaism(1) -Ultra-Orthodox  branches such as the Haredi (also spelled Chareidi) Judaism and Hasidic Judaism practice the most conservative form of Orthodox Judaism(1) -Members of ultra-Orthodox  branches of Judaism often live in separate communities to preserve their way of life, which can lead to isolation; as a result, children in these communities have fewer opportunities for play and communication interactions and may be delayed in developmental milestones(3) -Authors of a study conducted in Israel found that children from ultra-Orthodox communities were at increased risk for gross motor and verbal skill delays(3) -Fine motor skills and nonverbal cognitive development (especially reading) tested within the average range(3) \u2013Conservative: less strict in Jewish tradition, making concessions for modern culture and society; Conservative Jews may keep a kosher home but may not follow these dietary restrictions outside of the home(1) \u2013Reform: the liberal and progressive movement; members of this denomination may not engage in any special daily practices but still typically observe holidays, religious rites, and dietary or cultural customs(1)  \u2013Reconstructionist: a relatively new movement in Judaism that views the religion as evolving; various views and traditions from Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform are used(1)",
            "There are three broad groupings of Jews based on geographic/regional origins: \u2013Ashkenazi Jews are those individuals who are descendants of European, Eastern European, and Russian Jews(1,2,4) -Ashkenazi Jews make up 82% of the world\u2019s Jewish population(1) \u2013Sephardic Jews have origins in Europe, the Mediterranean, and North Africa(1,2,4) \u2013Eastern or Oriental Jews are those descended from ancient communities in Islamic lands (e.g., the Falasha, who are Black Jews from Ethiopia; Iraqi Jews; and Persian Jews from Iran)(1,2,4) \u2013A sabra is a Jewish person who was born in Israel(1,2) \u2013Jekkes is a term for a group of German Jews who escaped Nazi Germany and immigrated to Israel between 1933 and 1945; these patients will be 80 years of age or older(5)",
            "Continued learning and education, both religious and nonreligious, throughout the lifespan is extremely important in the Jewish community(1) \u2013Formal education is highly respected and valued, and many Jewish patients will be highly educated(1) \u2013In the United States, Jewish school-aged  children often attend Hebrew school in addition to public or private school(1)",
            "There is an increased risk of certain genetic disorders among individuals of Jewish descent, especially Ashkenazi Jews(1) \u2013In most cases, these disorders are autosomal recessive, which means that both parents would have to be carriers of the affected gene in order to pass the disorder on to their child(1) \u2013These disorders include Tay-Sachs  disease, Gaucher\u2019s disease, Canavan\u2019s disease, familial dysautonomia (Riley-Day syndrome), torsion dystonia, Niemann-Pick  disease, Bloom syndrome, Fanconi\u2019s anemia, and mucolipidosis(1,4,6,7) \u2013Other conditions that occur with increased incidence among Jews include: -Inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., ulcerative colitis, Crohn\u2019s disease)(1) -Colorectal cancer(1,4) -Mutations of the BRCA1  and BRCA2  genes associated with breast cancer and ovarian cancer(1,4)",
            "Survival syndrome, a condition affecting people who have experienced severe trauma, has been associated with survivors of the Holocaust, as well as second and third generation offspring of survivors of the Holocaust(21) \u2013Survival syndrome typically presents with posttraumatic stress disorder, chronic anxiety and depression, and family health and relationships may be compromised \u2013In families where one or both parents survived the Holocaust, offspring have reported experiencing emotional distance, neglect, role reversal between parents and children, and parent-child  overprotectiveness \u2013Family conflict, fear of separation, obsession with food, a strong need to please parents, a belief that feeling happy is not allowed, and preoccupation with death have also been attributed to intergenerational transmission of survival syndrome in this population"
