            "CP describes a complex group of persistent nonprogressive disorders of central origin involving movement or posture and motor function,including spasticity, dyskinesia, hypotonia, and ataxia, that occur due to damaged brain tissue from various perinatal or neonatal causes. Motor impairments are frequently accompanied by multiple comorbid conditions, including vision and hearing deficits, cognitive disabilities, and seizure disorders(51,52,53)",
            "CP is the most common motor disability in childhood(31)",
            "There are three different systems,anatomic, physiologic, and functional,by which CP can be classified. They can be combined to assess lesion location and severity, make treatment decisions, and predict functional outcome(51,52,53)",
            "Anatomic classification(51,52,53) \u2013Anatomic classification may assist with localization of underlying anomaly or injury \u2013Assesses distribution of involvement -Monoplegia: one extremity involved (rare) -Diplegia: lower extremities more affected than upper extremities -Hemiplegia: one side of the body more affected and upper extremities usually more than lower extremities -Quadriplegia: all four limbs affected, upper extremities usually more affected, and trunk and orofacial muscles may also be involved -Other designations may include -paraplegia: lower half of body affected, including both legs -triplegia: three limbs are affected -double hemiplegia: all four limbs affected, but greater on one side and often with the upper extremities affected more than lower extremities -tetraplegia: all four limbs affected, may be greater in three limbs (not used in a consistent manner in the literature)",
            "Physiologic classification(51,52,53) \u2013Physiologic classification may assist in assessing function and planning treatment \u2013Assesses quality of muscle function and motor impairment -Spastic/pyramidal (present in 80\u201390%  of persons with CP) -Hypertonia with resistance to externally imposed movement with one or more of the following  -increases with increasing speed of stretch -varies with direction of joint movement -rises rapidly above a threshold speed or joint angle -Spasticity is combined with anatomic classification into specific types -Spastic diplegia -Spastic quadriplegia -Spastic hemiplegia -Nonspastic/extrapyramidal -Hypotonia with decreased or variable muscle tone -Results in loose, floppy limbs -Movement can be slow or fast, repetitive, and sometimes rhythmic -Planned movements can result in intention tremors, which increase with stress and resolve during sleep -May have increased reflexes and Babinski response -Nonspastic CP is divided into two groups -Ataxic: inability to coordinate voluntary muscular movements due to abnormal force, rhythm, and accuracy, including -impairment of coordinated movements such as balance and posture -wide or irregular walking gait -impairment of eye movements and depth perception -poor fine motor skills -Dyskinetic: collective term for several involuntary movement disorders, including -chorea: abrupt, jerky, nonrhythmic distal movements without pattern -athetosis: slow, writhing, continuous movements in the extremities -dystonia: twisting and repetitive movements with or without abnormal postures -usually associated with some spasticity -Mixed forms are frequent",
            "Functional classification(51,52,53) \u2013Functional classification assesses function and limitations in activity -The most used functional classification system is the Gross Motor Classification System (GMFCS) -The child is classified into one of five levels based on ability to ambulate and level of independence -GMFCS classification applied to an infant is likely to change up until age 2, after which it stabilizes",
            "Statistics vary per country \u2013Researchers looking at the birth prevalence of spastic CP in a heterogeneous U.S. metropolitan area from 1985 to 2002 determined a prevalence of 1.9 per 1,000 1-year  survivors. They also concluded that CP prevalence was stable, which was encouraging given improvements in neonatal survival. However, the persistence of higher CP prevalence among non-Hispanic  Blacks when compared to non-Hispanic  Whites was concerning(38)",
