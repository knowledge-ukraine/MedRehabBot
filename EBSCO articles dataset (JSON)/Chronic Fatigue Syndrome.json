            "Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a disabling, idiopathic malaise that bed rest does not resolve, characterized by a spectrum of symptoms that are severe enough to impair physical functioning(1)",
            "There are several case definitions for CFS and all require fatigue as one of the symptoms. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) uses the following case definition outlined in their 1994 guidelines(2) \u2013CFS diagnostic criteria include at least 6 months of clinical fatigue with no known medical condition that significantly interferes with daily activities and work, and at least 4 of the following 8 symptoms: poor memory/concentration, sore throat, tender lymph nodes, myalgias, arthralgias, recent-onset  headache, unrefreshing sleep, and excessive tiredness with exercise(1)",
            "Although there is no known cure for CFS, the addition of individualized graded exercise therapy (GET)and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) may improve physical functioning in ADLs(3,5)",
            "Muscle disuse due to avoidance of physical activity may contribute to the perception of increased fatigue during ADLs.(39)However, post-exertional  malaise is common after vigorous exercise(4)",

Patients could choose walking, cycling, or swimming \u2013Initial exercise duration was between 5 and 15 minutes and increases in duration and intensity were based on mean heart rate value achieved and patient\u2019s subjective feelings",
