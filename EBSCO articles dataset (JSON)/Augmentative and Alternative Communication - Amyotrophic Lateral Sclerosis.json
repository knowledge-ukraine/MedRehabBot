            "AAC is a communication system that augments or replaces verbal communication (i.e., speech) and includes four main components: symbols, aids, strategies, and techniques(1,2) \u2013Symbols can include objects, drawings, photographs, and orthography (written language; e.g., words, letters, sentences)(1) \u2013Aids can be relatively simple or complex devices for transmitting or receiving messages (e.g., communication board, letter board, electronic speech-generating device)(1) \u2013Strategies refer to the methods by which symbols can be conveyed in the easiest and most efficient manner. For example, symbol selection methods (linear or row-column scanning) and keyboard arrangements are considered \"strategies\" that affect the rate of symbol selection(1) \u2013Techniques refer to the ways in which the messages are selected for transmission (e.g., direct selection, scanning)(1)",
            "ALS is a progressive neuromuscular disease characterized by degeneration of motor neurons in the cortex, brainstem, and spinal cord.(3) Symptoms of the disease vary with respect to the site of motor neuron involvement. Both upper and lower motor neuron signs are present as the disease progresses. Symptoms include increased muscle tone (spasticity), hyperreflexia, pseudobulbar palsy, decreased muscle tone (flaccidity), muscle weakness, muscle atrophy, and decreased or absent stretch reflexes.(3) Other symptoms include difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), choking, gagging, head droop (due to weak neck muscles), muscle cramps, paralysis, speech problems, and voice changes.(4) For detailed information on communication disorders associated with ALS, see Clinical Review\u2026Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS):  Communication Disorders ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T708852. For detailed information on dysphagia associated with ALS, see Clinical Review\u2026Dysphagia: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T708986",
            "Communication in individuals with ALS typically is affected by dysarthria and weakness of the respiratory musculature. Respiratory weakness results in difficulty achieving appropriate vocal loudness and producing lengthy utterances. Mixed dysarthria, a combination of spastic and flaccid dysarthria, is common in patients with ALS and reduces intelligibility of speech.(5) Speech characteristics of individuals with ALS include hypernasality and nasal emission, imprecise consonants, pitch disturbances, reduced vocal volume, and harsh vocal quality.(5,6) Most individuals with ALS experience a severe communication disorder in the last few months of life, necessitating some form of AAC(6)"

AAC intervention is a multidisciplinary and ongoing procedure that may require multiple communication systems over many years to accommodate the patient\u2019s changing physical abilities(10)ALS is a progressive, fatal disease that typically results in a need for AAC in its later stages. AAC outcomes depend on a variety of factors, including the patient\u2019s physical status, the patient\u2019s level of cognition, the patient\u2019s language ability, the environment in which AAC is used, characteristics of the technology used, the patient\u2019s level of motivation, and the patient\u2019s experience with technology prior to the onset of the disease.(6) In addition, the caregiver\u2019s/ family\u2019s experience and comfort with technology can also affect the outcomes of AAC intervention(11) In a retrospective study conducted in the United States with 625 family members/caregivers of individuals with ALS that examined communication methods during the last 6 months of life, researchers found that as the end of life approached, all modes of communication decreased, including natural speech, writing, gestures, and use of AAC devices. Additionally, results indicated that immediately prior to death (1\u20132 days) approximately one fourth of the patients with ALS were unable to communicate in any way; however, another one fourth of these patients were still able to communicate with natural speech immediately prior to death(23)",

The OT and PT often determine the most accessible type of AAC system and provide essential input about the best way for a patient to access an AAC systemA PT will also assist in helping the patient tone muscles and maintain ROM.

This Clinical Review addresses only AAC intervention with patients with ALS; for detailed information on other compensatory strategies and types of intervention, see Clinical Review\u2026Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS): Communication Disorders , referenced above",
            "The following principles have been recommended for AAC intervention in patients with ALS: \u2013It is important that the SLP and/or physician educate the patient and the patient\u2019s family early in the course of the disease about AAC options. The patient should develop some familiarity with AAC before needing it on a regular basis(6) \u2013Any form of AAC provided to a patient with ALS should be highly individualized and highly adaptable.(47) Because the disease progression is rapid, the patient\u2019s physical needs (e.g., needing to add an eye-gaze  tracker) and communication needs (e.g., wanting to speak with a pastor and needing spiritual vocabulary) will change multiple times(47) \u2013Decline in speech intelligibility in patients with ALS is associated with a decline in speech rate. When speech is reduced from 200\u2013250  words per/minute to 100\u2013120  words per/minute, there an abrupt decline in speech intelligibility.(6) AAC options should be introduced before this decline in speech rate takes place \u2013When making AAC recommendations, the assessment team must consider both current and future physical and communication needs, as the patient\u2019s physical abilities are expected to decline(11) \u2013In the early stages of this disease, most patients try to maintain natural (oral) communication, but they might benefit from strategies to support oral output such as handwriting, gestures, facial expressions, letter board, or a portable computer for typing(11) -In a study conducted in the United Kingdom with 2 participant couples (comprised of a patient with ALS and a significant other, either spouse or child), researchers applied the principles of conversation analysis to videotaped communicative interactions in which the patients with ALS utilized handwriting as a form of AAC.(28) Typically, the conversation partner would read the handwritten contribution aloud after the patient with ALS finished writing, which researchers found served to provide explicit confirmation that the message was understood. If the message is not received as intended, this gives the patient an opportunity to reattempt the exchange either with handwriting or spoken words. Researchers also found that conversation partners could express unique affective information by reading the handwritten messages aloud (e.g., with facial expression and prosody or laughter halfway through reading). Researchers advocated for more research on how handwriting can be a useful form of AAC for patients with ALS as it has a high degree of familiarity for both conversation partners(28) \u2013In the intermediate stage of the disease, the patient may begin to use AAC technology in specific situations as speech and motor function decline. High-tech  devices may be favored over low-tech  communication systems at this time(11) \u2013In late-stage  disease, access methods such as switches and eye gaze are used when motor control and speech are severely impaired.(11) The patient may be confined to one location during late-stage  disease and interact primarily with family or trained caregivers. In a study conducted in the United States involving 4 patients with ALS, researchers found that patients were primarily concerned with communicating basic wants and needs during the late stages of ALS.(11) High-tech approaches were limited to specific activities with select persons and mainly included specific prerecorded questions or comments that could be accessed easily (e.g., \u201cHow was your day?\u201d)(11) ",
            "Computer-based  AAC/speech-generating  devices: Speech-generating devices have been classified into two main types: devices that allow for formation of new messages devices that use word or whole-phrase retrieval of prerecorded messages.(9) Caregivers and patients should be involved in selecting the device. Factors to consider when selecting a device include: \u2013Appearance: Considerations include size (handheld or mounted display), pictures (drawings, symbols, or photographs), and hardware (dedicated or undedicated system)(8) \u2013Accessibility and ease of use: Many patients with ALS have difficulty moving their arms, hands, and fingers to control a communication device. Access to the device may change as the disease progresses.(8) Access options include: -Head mouse: A head mouse allows the patient to control computer mouse movements by means of a wireless optical sensor that tracks a tiny target on the forehead. The head mouse can be used like a handheld mouse to select items on the screen. To communicate, the patient pauses on a letter on the computer with the mouse and the computer types the selected letter(9) -Eye-gaze  computer systems: Eye-gaze  systems rely on eye movement for activation. A closed-circuit television camera placed on the computer monitors and tracks retina movement. Some producers of eye gaze systems are Tobii Dynavox, Prentke Romich Company, Quick Glance, and LC Technologies(9) -Switch: A switch to turn the device on and off can be activated in multiple ways (e.g., by hand, foot, cheek, eyebrow, blink of the eye, elbow, knee)(9) \u2013V oice quality: Is the voice quality clear and understandable? Is it digitized (recorded human speech) or synthesized (computer-generated  speech)? A digitized voice allows only for preprogrammed utterances, whereas synthesized speech allows for novel utterances. Does the patient have any difficulty perceiving the voice?(8) \u2013Effectiveness: Does the device meet the patient\u2019s communication needs?(8) \u2013Dynamic screen technology or static display:Are the symbols fixed or is the patient able to produce and manipulate additional symbols through navigating a hierarchy of symbols on real or digital pages?(8) \u2013Language demands: How are messages composed? Letters, single words, text plus symbols, phrases, sentences, visual scenes?(8) \u2013Functionality: Computerized devices can be dedicated for communication only or undedicated, those that feature other functions such as word processing, e-mail,  or Internet access (desktop PC, laptop, or tablet)(9,20) -Tablets offer many different applications that can be used for primary AAC devices with features such as text input, word prediction and abbreviation expansion, direct selection of icons, and voice output(20)",
            "Brain-computer  interface (BCI) AAC is an emerging technology and researchers are investigating its effectiveness in improving communication in patients with ALS(48,49,50) \u2013BCI AAC uses EEG readings to allow the AAC user to access the AAC device and communicate(49) \u2013In a pilot study with 42 subjects with ALS, 14 of the subjects were able to learn how to use BCI device, with the primary purpose being communication(49)",
            "Partner-assisted  communication techniques: Partner-assisted communication techniques can be used during the late stages of ALS, when the patient has less independent control over communication: \u2013Yes/no system: The patient responds \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d to a partner\u2019s question. The responses can be natural (e.g., head nod, vocal response) or communication systems that require training (e.g., eye gaze system, pointing to yes/no cards, depressing a switch with a buzzer). Training of a yes/no system is done through repetition, modeling, and reinforcement by the SLP and other persons in the patient\u2019s environment.(19) Yes/no systems typically are used more in the late stages of ALS(11) \u2013Tagged yes/no questions: To facilitate the patient\u2019s responses to yes/no questions, the conversational partner adds a question tag (\u201cyes or no\u201d) at the end of the question, leaving a pause between \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno.\u201d The verbal questions can be accompanied by a gesture (thumbs up or thumbs down) and appropriate intonation. The patient can then nod, use eye gaze, use gesture, or give verbal responses(8)",
            "Stored information systems/low-technology  interventions: Stored information systems such as a communication board, book, or remnant book allow the patient to independently access items for communication or access items with a partner\u2019s assistance. Pictures or words are personalized to meet the needs of the patient. Words can be divided into categories and placed in a small notebook or single piece of cardboard so that the patient can have easy access to them. Common needs, such as items depicting pain, hunger, and food choices, are typically included in a communication device; however,  items that convey information to maintain social closeness, transfer new ideas, or express social etiquette should not be deemphasized. The use of personalized visual scenes can assist the patient in conversing with a partner on topics of interest. Information manuals and free visual scenes for PC users are available online(21)",
            "Multiple modes of communication: The patient should use a combination of modes of communication, such as gestures, drawing, or writing, to convey messages.(2) Many patients in the early stages of ALS use multiple modes of communication(11) See Description , Indications of device/equipment , and Guidelines for use of device/equipment , above .

        "While the majority of patients with ALS agree to use some form of AAC, some patients may resist adopting AAC strategies for a variety of reasons, including lack of experience with technology and reluctance to decrease verbal communication. Research on AAC acceptance and use has identified factors that facilitate adoption of AAC: Counseling the patient and family on AAC options and introducing them before there is a decline in motor speech skills(11) Involving the caregiver in treatment sessions and training the caregiver in the use of AAC strategies and the AAC device(11) Involving other rehabilitation specialists in treatment and the use of AAC techniques. For example, while working with an OT, the patient could be prompted to request needed items (e.g., razor) using an AAC system(18) Providing functional AAC intervention in the patient\u2019s natural environment (e.g., home, work) Monitoring AAC use beyond the training stage and making adaptations as the disease progresses(11)"
