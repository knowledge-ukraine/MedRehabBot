            "AAC is a communication system that supplements or replaces verbal communication (speech) and includes four main components: symbols, aids, techniques, and strategies(1,2) \u2013Symbols include objects, drawings, photographs, and orthography(1) \u2013Aids can be relatively simple or complex devices (e.g., communication board, electronic speech-generating  device) for transmitting or receiving messages(1) \u2013Techniques refer to the ways in which the messages are selected for transmission (e.g., direct selection, scanning)(1) \u2013Strategies refer to the methods by which symbols can be conveyed most easily and efficiently (i.e., the most effective way for the individual to combine symbols, aids, and techniques to best communicate)(1)",
            "Aphasia is an impairment in the ability to use or understand language that results from damage to the language areas of the brain.(2) This impairment leads to difficulties communicating or understanding information, reduced ability in establishing and maintaining relationships, and impaired ability to fulfill social roles.(4) (For detailed information on different types of aphasia as well as assessment and treatment for aphasia, see the series of Clinical Reviews on aphasia)",
            "For patients with aphasia, the use of AAC might be temporary or permanent(1)",
            "Patients with aphasia who are candidates for AAC have been classified as either \u201cpartner-dependent\u201d  communicators, those who need cueing or assistance in communicating, or \u201cindependent\u201d communicators, those who can access and use AAC without assistance(5) \u2013Partner-dependent  communicators: These patients have significant difficulty speaking, using symbols, and responding to conversation. They seldom communicate purposefully(5) \u2013Independent communicators: Patients who are independent communicators can locate messages in their AAC systems and a few can formulate novel messages. They might be able to learn how to overcome communication breakdowns and to integrate AAC into real-life  situations(5) "

Factors to consider when selecting a device include: \u2013Appearance: size, hardware, pictures (any pictures and text should be personally relevant when possible)(46) \u2013Symbols should be culturally and individually/personally relevant (e.g., if the patient participates in religious activities, options that allow for communication in these situations should be included)(46) \u2013Accessibility and ease of use: Many patients have paralysis or hemiparesis, in which case portability should be considered. Can the patient use the device while holding it at the same time? Can the patient carry the device? \u2013V oice quality: Is the digitized or synthesized voice output clear? Does the patient have any difficulty perceiving or understanding the voice?  \u2013Effectiveness: Does the device meet the patient\u2019s needs? \u2013Display/layout: dynamic screen technology or static display, number of symbols per page -In a study conducted in the United States, researchers examined the ability of 10 subjects with Broca\u2019s aphasia and 10 control subjects to complete a series of experimental tasks with single-symbol and subject-verb-object  sentence identification on an SGD in the presence or absence of competing stimuli(37) -Researchers asked the following questions: -What is the effect of number of symbols per screen on recognition accuracy and response time for a single symbol?(4,8,12,16,37) -What is the effect of hierarchically organizing symbols semantically according to complexity on recognition accuracy and response time for a single symbol?(37) -What is the effect of competing stimuli on recognition accuracy and response time for a single symbol?(37) -What is the effect of competing stimuli/environmental distraction on recognition accuracy and response time for symbols representing subject-verb-object sentences?(37) -Do persons with aphasia perceive task difficulty differently from the persons in the control group without disabilities?(37) -Researchers\u2019 findings -Both control subjects and subjects with aphasia accurately identified more single symbols in the 4-symbol-per-screen condition than in the 8, 12, and 16 symbol conditions. Response latency was shortest for 4-symbol  condition and increased in a stepwise manner for 8, 12, and 16 symbols; for the control subjects, latency was the shortest for 4, then 12, 8, and 16(37) -When organized hierarchically by complexity, patients with aphasia accurately identified significantly more symbols under level 1 condition versus levels 2 and 3. Control group accurately identified the most symbols in level 2, followed by 1 and 3(37) -Subjects with aphasia accurately identified subject, verb, and object significantly more in focused attention conditions versus divided and sustained attention conditions; listening condition did not affect accuracy for control subjects. Listening condition did not affect accuracy for symbol selection for subjects with aphasia(37) -Perceived task difficulty was significantly higher for subjects with aphasia versus those in the control group(37) -In a study conducted in the United States, researchers examined the effect of two different static-button  layouts on SGDs for two adult patients with aphasia (one with severe nonfluent aphasia and the other with moderate fluent aphasia). The patients were trialed on two different layouts using the same content for both trials. The first layout was a\u201chomepage\u201d layout, which provided a set of static buttons as a homepage and each subsequent page that was opened contained a new set of symbols, along with a \u201chome\u201d that returned the patient to the static homepage. The second layout was a \u201cnavigation ring\u201d layout,in which a collection of smaller, static buttons appeared around the edge of each screen,allowing the patient to jump to a new topic immediately. Each patient was trained in each of the layouts for two phases in alternating order (i.e., patient 1: navigation ring\u2013homepage\u2013navigation ring\u2013homepage;  patient 2: homepage\u2013navigation ring\u2013homepage\u2013navigation  ring). The total intervention time was 3 months, and for each phase patients received a maximum of 5 sessions. Intervention was based on the principles of errorless learning. Both patients were successful at learning how to navigate through both layouts. At the conclusion of the intervention, researchers found that both participants were more consistent and efficient in finding target sentences with the navigation-ring layout(39) \u2013Language demands: How are messages composed? Letters, single words, text plus symbols, phrases, sentences, visual scenes?",
            "Universal design is a relatively new concept with respect to assistive technology, including AAC; the idea of universal design is to create devices that serve the needs of a wide range of individuals, both with and without disabilities. For example, there are many apps available for download on the iPad that allow it to become a high-tech  AAC device for a patient with aphasia, but it can also be used by the patient\u2019s spouse whose language abilities are intact.(40,41) For devices with universal design, no adaptations are necessary.(42) The iPad and other commercially available computer tablets also have the advantage of being highly socially acceptable, which is appealing to many patients who do not want their AAC device to appear awkward or stand out ",
            "There are a limited number of research studies investigating the efficacy of technology-based  AAC interventions in patients with aphasia. Authors of a review of studies involving patients with chronic and severe aphasia summarized the findings in several case studies: \u2013Patients with chronic and severe aphasia are able to use AAC to access, identify, manipulate, and combine computer-based graphic symbols to communicate in simple phrases and sentences in clinical settings(2) \u2013Nouns are identified and produced more accurately than other parts of speech(2) \u2013Individuals with Broca\u2019s and global aphasia perform better on tasks that involve graphic symbols than they do on tasks that involve natural language(2) \u2013Research indicates that patients with severe aphasia are able to use computer-based  AAC devices in clinical settings; however, there are minimal data to support the efficacy of computer-based  AAC devices in functional situations(2,20) \u2013Before recommending the use of an AAC device, the SLP should confirm its effectiveness in substantial clinical observations(2)",
            "Stored information systems/low-tech  interventions: Stored information systems such as a communication board, book, or remnant book allow the patient to independently access items for communication or access items with a partner\u2019s assistance. Pictures or words are personalized to meet the needs of the patient. Words can be divided into categories and placed in a small notebook or single piece of cardboard so that the patient can have easy access to them. A remnant book that contains actual items of a patient\u2019s past experiences (e.g., photographs, tickets) can be used to engage others in conversation.(2) One criticism of such devices is that they lack personalization and contextualization.(20) Common needs, such as items depicting pain, hunger, and food choices, are typically included in a communication device; however, items that convey information to maintain social closeness, transfer new ideas, or express social etiquette are sometimes deemphasized. The use of personalized visual scenes can assist the patient in conversing with a partner on topics of interest \u2013In all cases, patients who use AAC for communication should have a low-tech  component to their AAC system.(44) Because batteries and computers fail, no patient should be trained only in the use of an electronic device to communicate.(44) In addition to technology failures, the clinician must consider that one AAC device or method cannot meet all of a patient\u2019s communication needs for all possible situations and speakers; hence, a low-tech  option (or multiple low-tech options) should always be provided.(2,44) There is no one low-tech  option that works best for all patients; it is important to trial several different speech supplementation methods and determine which type increases speech intelligibility/functional communication the most(45) -Low-tech  options include: -Pen and paper -Iconic gestures(45) -Pointing gestures(47) -Low-tech  eye gaze board (a board with topics, letters, pictures, or symbols spread out into different quadrants so the patient can use eye gaze with a partner to communicate)(44) -Alphabet supplementation board (a board with the alphabet written on it so the speaker can indicate the first letter of the word he or she is trying to say when communication breakdowns occur)(44,45) -Topic/semantic supplementation board (a board with frequently used and personally meaningful conversation topics or pictures on it so the speaker can indicate the topic to the listener, thereby increasing listener comprehension)(45) \u2013In a study conducted in the United States, researchers investigated visual attention patterns in 10 individuals with aphasia to determine the effect of human engagement in pictures. In adults without disabilities, research has documented that persons preferentially attend to and fixate on human figures in pictures. Researchers sought to determine if this same pattern existed for adults with aphasia and if the information could then be used to guide AAC picture selection. Researchers found a clear pattern of fixation on human figures among the adults with aphasia. Additionally, the latency to first fixation on the object of interest was significantly greater when the human in the picture was looking at the camera rather than engaging in the task. For example, if the object of interest was a computer, it took the patients with aphasia significantly longer to fixate on the computer if the person using the computer was looking at the camera rather than looking at and using the computer. Researchers suggested using this information to better tailor pictures used in AAC; patients with aphasia naturally tend to fixate on human figures, so pictures should reflect humans engaged in the target activity or with the target object in pictures used for AAC(36) ",
            "Multiple modes of communication: The patient is trained to use a combination of modes of communication, such as gestures, drawing, or writing, to convey messages(2) \u2013Authors of a systematic review of gesture treatments for a combined total of 134 adults with poststroke aphasia reported that comparative effect sizes support the benefit of combined gesture + verbal treatment for noun and verb production for some persons with aphasia. However, it is not clear if the benefit of gesture+verbal treatment is greater than for verbal treatment alone. Additionally, authors reported that symbolic gestures can be acquired by persons with aphasia, but the communicative effectiveness of these gestures necessitates further study. Overall, authors report that gestural training in aphasia, although generating some positive outcomes, is still relatively understudied and in need of large-scale  research studies(34) \u2013In a study conducted in the Netherlands, researchers compared iconic(visual representations of specific idea; e.g., rapid hand movement up and down might indicate the action of chopping vegetables) and deictic (pointing gestures) co-speech gestures of persons with aphasia and found that gestures degrade in a similar manner to verbal language(28) -Researchers created video clips of 25 participants with aphasia and 17 age-matched  adult participants without aphasia; in the clips all participants were performing portions of an experimental version of the Scenario Test (e.g., role-playing asking a sales clerk for information about a sweater)(28) -In one task, the control participants were told they could speak and gesture freely (verbal control), and in the other they were asked to only gesture (nonverbal control)(28) -Researchers recruited individuals without any expertise in the area of aphasia or gesture to be raters for the video clips. For the first part of the study, each rater was exposed to the clips of the participants with aphasia (moderate or severe) and was randomly assigned to one of three modalities\u2014hearing audio without video, seeing video without audio, and seeing both audio and video simultaneously.(28) In the second part of the experiment, raters watched the verbal control clips, and in the third part, raters watched the nonverbal control clips.(28) Each portion of the study had different raters (15\u201316  per condition described above) -Researchers came to the following conclusions after analyzing all of the study data: -Speakers with moderate aphasia had more informative gestures than those with severe aphasia(28) -Speakers with aphasia and apraxia had the most difficult time producing informative gestures(28) -For speakers with moderate aphasia, rater comprehension was the highest when both gesture and verbal information was available, suggesting that gestures did provide additional information (not simply echoing what was being said)(28) -Speakers with aphasia did not necessarily make use of gestures\u2019 full communicative potential(28) -Speakers with severe aphasia used mostly gestures that outline shapes(28) \u2013In a study conducted in the United Kingdom, researchers analyzed conversation samples from AphasiaBank  (a multimedia database with samples of persons with aphasia and healthy controls, http://aphasia.talkbank.org/ ) from 46 adults with poststroke aphasia and 10 healthy matched controls, all of whom gestured at least once during a story retell task(31) -Researchers coded 12 different types of gestures: -Referential gestures: assigning entity to referents into the space in front of the speaker when a concrete object is absent(31) -Concrete deictic gestures: indicating a concrete referent present in a physical environment(31) -Pointing to self(31) -Iconic observer viewpoint (OVPT) gestures: depicting a concrete action, event, or object as though the person was observing it (e.g., using fingers as though they were the legs of a person running)(31) -Iconic character viewpoint (CVPT) gestures: depicting a concrete action, event, or object as though the person was doing it (e.g., moving arms back and forth as though the person was running)(31) -Pantomime gestures: a series of two or more CVPT gestures(31) -Metaphoric gestures: presenting an abstract concept(31) -Emblems: well-established  gestures for specific purposes (e.g., thumbs up or \u201cok\u201d hand signal)(31) -Time gestures: indicate a point in time(31) -Beats: movements without a discernible meaning that are recognized through prototypical repetitive movement timed with speech(31)  -Letter gestures: using hand/fingers to \u201cwrite\u201d a letter(31) -Number gestures: holding up fingers to indicate numbers(31) -Researchers reported the following findings with respect to gesture production patterns of persons with aphasia: -Persons with Wernicke\u2019s aphasia used the most gestures in conversation overall; additionally, the number of gestures produced in a gesture unit was highest for persons with Wernicke\u2019s aphasia(31) -When speech fluency was calculated, persons with Broca\u2019s, transcortical motor, or conduction aphasia had the highest rates of gesture per 100 words spoken(31) -Despite the high number of gestures produced by persons with Wernicke\u2019s aphasia, the number of gestures with high semantic content was low(31) -Gestures produced by persons with Broca\u2019s or conduction aphasia were more meaningful (e.g., emblems, concrete deictic, iconics)(31) -Because persons with Broca\u2019s, conduction, or transcortical motor aphasia were capable of producing high numbers of meaningful gestures, researchers recommended that SLPs routinely consider gesture training as part of an AAC intervention for these patients(31) \u2013In a study conducted in Australia, researchers analyzed gesture production of a group of 29 participants with aphasia and 29 control participants and found that impaired semantic knowledge in aphasia affects both iconic gestures produced during fluent speech and those produced during word-finding  difficulties(32) -Researchers recorded participants describing a cartoon that they had just watched and tagged/coded all iconic gestures as \u201cmanner\u201d (depicting the way a movement takes place; e.g., using the hands to demonstrate lifting a box), \u201cpath only\u201d(depicting the direction of a movement; e.g., hand points up to show that a cat climbed up a tree), \u201cshape outline\u201d (tracing or molding the hands to show the shape of an object; e.g., cupping hands to show a bowl), or \u201cother.\u201dThe gestures were then separated into either those occurring during fluent speech or those occurring during a moment of word-finding difficulty(32) -Researchers reported the following findings: -Participants with aphasia produced a significantly higher frequency of iconic gestures than did the control participants overall; however, when the non-wording-finding  gestures were removed from the totals, there was no longer a difference(32) -Non-word-finding  gestures of both participants with aphasia and control participants were mostly path only or manner gestures(32) -There was a significant association between proportion of word-finding  moments that contained gestures and semantic knowledge of the participants with aphasia (but not with gestures produced during fluent speech); researchers suggested that this finding indicated that participants with more intact semantic knowledge were better able to produce iconic gestures during a moment of word-finding(32) \u2013In a study conducted in Germany, researchers analyzed the gesture use of 16 participants with varying degrees of aphasia severity as they retold what they had seen in short video clips in verbal and silent conditions (asked to retell the stories by exclusively using gestures)(33) -Researchers reported the following findings: -Some participants were able to spontaneously compensate for verbal language deficits with gesture and convey additional information via gesture(33) -Some of the participants in the study were not fully utilizing the communicative potential of gestures, while others were able to communicate a message via gesture without any verbal input(33) -Researchers could predict communicative efficacy of gestures by how well the participants were able to pantomime tool use (traditionally a test for apraxia)(33) \u2013In a pilot study conducted in the United Kingdom, researchers developed and tested a computerized gesture training (GeST) program for patients with aphasia.(35) In the program, level 1 modeled target gestures, level 2 presented the gestures in a 3D gaming environment, and level 3 demonstrated target gesture use in real-world  scenarios. Nine persons, all of whom had severe aphasia, were recruited for the study, and each completed 6 weekly sessions of GeST. For the first 3 weeks of therapy (phase 1) an SLP was present, and for the second 3 weeks (phase 2) participants completed GeST sessions independently; 15 different gestures were targeted in each of the two phases. At the conclusion of therapy, the gestures that were included in phase 1 (with the SLP support) showed significant improvement; however, those gestures  targeted in the independent sessions did not. There was no generalization to gestures not targeted in one of the two phases(35) \u2013In a case study, a 72-year-old  patient with Broca\u2019s aphasia who had 2 years of direct speech-language  therapy followed by a 3-year  hiatus participated in 6 weeks of therapy (daily interdisciplinary treatment) in which he was taught to use Amer-Ind  Code (manual signs based on Native American Hand Talk) and drawing to assist him in communicating. After treatment, he was able to use 30 gestures functionally and draw basic ADL needs (90% transparency rated by his daughter)(19)",
            "Partner-assisted  communication techniques \u2013Written-choice  communication: Partner-assisted  communication involves a communication partner selecting topics of interest and initiating interaction using written word choices to facilitate responses from the person with aphasia. The person with aphasia is provided with written word choices or graphic rating scales to point to when responding to questions. This method is dependent on adequate reading ability of the patient(2) \u2013Authors of a systematic review of the methodology of communication partner training studies for persons with aphasia found that the methodological quality of these studies is highly varied.(29) Overall, authors reported that communication partner training studies had poor treatment fidelity (i.e., the methods used to examine and enhance the reliability and validity of behavioral interventions tested)(29) \u2013In a study conducted in Finland with 34 adults with aphasia and their communication partners, researchers found that communication skills and efficiency improved after a partner-focused  intervention, Communication Therapy for People with Aphasia and their Partners (APPUTE)(30) -The aim of APPUTE is to practice functional communication strategies in a structured program with individualized guidance from an SLP. Both the person with aphasia and the communication partner are actively involved in therapy. The program involves three different types of communication tasks arranged hierarchically\u2014pictures with objects and activities, detailed situational pictures, and events from the news(30) -In each session and at each level of task, the SLP and person with aphasia start the session alone, at which time the therapist explains the task and shows the person with aphasia the pictures/objects/news stories. When the partner joins the session, the SLP guides both conversation partners in strategy use to increase communication efficacy and accuracy(30) -In this study, the APPUTE program was provided over the course of two 14-day  intensive rehabilitation periods at 6-month  intervals and outcomes were measured 6 months after the end of the second rehabilitation period(30) -Outcomes were measured by the WAB-R,  Communication Effectiveness Index (CETI), Communication Skill Evaluation (CSE), Couple Communication Scale-B,  and APPUTE evaluation questionnaires for both partners(30) -Significant improvements in communication skills were found on the WAB-R  for the persons with aphasia and the CSE for the conversation partners. Communication efficacy of the persons with aphasia as measured by the CETI improved significantly. Communication skills of the couples improved significantly as measured by the CSE. Although the goal of the program was not to improve linguistic skills of the persons with aphasia (it was to improve functional communication between partners), researchers found improvements, especially with respect to verbal naming(30)",
            "Facilitated communication: In the 1990s, an AAC strategy called facilitated communication was widely promoted as method for providing assistance to a nonverbal person to indicate letters, words, phrases, or sentences using a computer, typewriter, or alphabet board. The facilitator uses manual prompting to support the communicator\u2019s hand in selecting the letters or phrases. Multiple research studies have found that there is no scientific evidence that this method is effective or valid; blind studies in which the facilitators are asked different questions than the patient demonstrate that facilitators often unintentionally select the message for the patient rather than assist the patient in creating his or her own messages(21) .
