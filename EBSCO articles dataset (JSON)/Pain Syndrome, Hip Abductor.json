Consider ambulating with cane on unaffected side to reduce irritation of trochanteric bursa _ _ Prescription, application of devices and equipment _ Customized foot orthotics _ _ Physical agents/ mechanical modalities _ Ice pack/ice massage or heat pack for pain management _ _ No evidence to support use of phonophoresis, iontophoresis, or low-intensity pulsed ultrasound _N/A Patient education for pain management (ice pack and heat pack), independent exercise program, and hip protection Reduced ROM and strength at hipNormalize strength and ROM of hipTherapeutic exercises _ Progressive, multidirectional hip strengthening and flexibility program. Place special emphasis on stretching ITB and hip internal and external rotators, as well as on strengthening the hip abductorsManual therapy _ If treating for gluteus mediustendinopathy, manually mobilize gluteus medius tendon and follow with assisted stretching of hip abductorsHip abductor strengthening program with appropriate elastic resistance band.
