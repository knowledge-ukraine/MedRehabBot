            "Glycogen storage disease type V (GSDV) is a rare, autosomal recessive genetic disorder. GSDV causes metabolic myopathy due to the absence of human muscle phosphorylase (myophosphorylase), which is required for the breakdown of glycogen (glycogenolysis)(1)",

            "GSDV restricts oxidative substrate availability for vigorous physical activity by blocking glycogen breakdown(10)",
            "Myophosphorylase is needed to breakdown glycogen (a polymer of glucose) and release glucose",
            "Without glycogenolysis, the lactic acid pathway (anaerobic glycolysis) is largely blocked.(15) GSDV thus especiallyrestricts intense (\u201chard\u201d) physical activity beyond a few minutes",
            "Myophosphorylase deficiency also impairs maximal aerobic work capacity. Patients typically have very low peak oxygenuptake (VO 2 peak) compared to normal controls, averaging only 35% to 50% of normal(4,8)",
            "Moderate aerobic exercise above lactic acid threshold intensity, which occurs at roughly 60% of VO 2 peak, or about 70%of peak HR, in the general population is also limited because some anaerobic metabolism is required to satisfy the totalenergy demand(4)",
            "Low-intensity  (\u201clight\u201d) physical activity is usually well tolerated in GSDV because the energy requirement is providedmainly by mitochondrial oxidation of blood-borne free fatty acids and glucose released from the liver glycogen store(14)",
            "During the first minutes of strenuous exercise there is a period of metabolic shift, from mostly anaerobic to mostlyoxidative energy production, as oxygen delivery increases to active muscle. Patients with GSDV experience this shift as aso-called  second-wind  phenomenon after 8 to 10 minutes of exercise, at which time there is reduced muscle pain/cramping,breathing discomfort, and perceived exertion(14)",
            "Prolonged static contraction (such as a handgrip, toe point, or squat) is poorly tolerated due to muscle ischemia thatrestricts oxygen delivery for aerobic metabolism; performing these exercises without rest breaks and proper precautions canincrease symptoms and risk of rhabdomyolysis(14)",
            "Muscle cramping causes cellular injury and myolysis, as indicated by leakage of muscle enzymes (e.g., creatine kinase,lactic dehydrogenase) and myoglobin. The buildup of myoglobin in blood produces myoglobinuria and might lead to renaltubular damage(7,14)"
