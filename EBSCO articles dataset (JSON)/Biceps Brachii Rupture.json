        "description": [
            "Rupture of the biceps brachii occurs most often proximally in the long head of the biceps tendon (LHBT), either at the bicipital groove or from avulsion at the superior rim of the glenoid labrum. Rupture of the biceps brachii distal tendon involves partial or complete tears of the aponeurosis at the radial tuberosity(1,5)",
            "LHBT rupture is usually nontraumatic and associated with tendinosis and chronic partial tearing (i.e., degenerative changes) due to rotator cuff impingement or shoulder joint instability(1,5)",
            "LHBT rupture is generally characterized by the Popeye deformity. However, in obese individuals, the Popeye deformity may not be obvious (5)",
            "Distal biceps rupture is less common (1.2 cases/100,000 per year) and, in contrast, is usually caused by severe blunt trauma or unexpected eccentric tearing(4)",
            "The brachialis and brachioradialis muscles are primary elbow flexors like the biceps, but the brachialis does not contribute to forearm supination and the brachioradialis is a much weaker supinator than the biceps. Following biceps rupture, strength is thus reduced more in supination than in elbow flexion, especially after complete distal rupture or avulsion from the radial tuberosity(2,5)",
            "The LHBT also assists in stabilizing the humeral head in the glenoid fossa during powerful elbow flexion, forearm supination, and abduction of the shoulder in the scapular plane. (5,6) A significant deficit in these functions after LHBT rupture may impair overhead activities (e.g., lifting, throwing, painting)",
            "The initial management of biceps rupture typically is conservative in middle-aged  and older adults, whereas surgical treatment (i.e., reattachment, tenodesis, autograft) may be chosen for restoring biceps function in young, physically active adults and in cases of complete distal rupture(1,5)"

Instruct the patient in use of cold packs, proper posture, and correct body mechanics(3)  Reduced ROM Improve ROM Physical agents and mechanical modalities _ The use of hot packs prior to treatment may assist in attaining further ROM gains. The efficacy of ultrasound therapy is uncertain _ _ Therapeutic exercises _ Once pain has subsided, ROM and gentle stretching exercises may be prescribed (e.g., wall walking, pulleys, towel stretches). Avoidance of abduction and aggressive overhead exercises may be necessary _ _ Manual therapy _ Resolve restricted scapular, thoracic spine, and/or shoulder joint arthrokinematics with appropriate joint mobilization techniquesTherapeutic exercises _ Progress abduction and overhead exercises, as appropriateHome exercise program of ROM and stretching exercises  Shoulder/scapular and biceps muscle weakness or atrophyIncrease strength of weak musclesTherapeutic exercises _ Strengthening should focus on the scapular stabilizers and the rotator cuff. Begin with isometric strengthening of the middle/lower scapular retractors along with internal and external rotator cuff strengthening exercises, as indicated _ _ Manual therapy _ Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) for improving scapulohumeral rhythm (e.g., therapist manually resists scapular elevation, depression, protraction, and retraction)Therapeutic exercises _ Progress to dynamic scapular stabilizing exercises, anterosuperior rotator cuff strengthening (e.g., scaption or forward flexion with weight),(3) and biceps strengthening (e.g., isometrics, bicep curls, or resisted supination as appropriate)Provide a home exercise program that incorporates strengthening of the scapular stabilizers, rotator cuff, and biceps Poor posture and weak core/trunk strengthCorrect faulty posture and improve core/trunk strengthPatient education _ Educate the patient on proper posture concepts along with posture monitoring techniques _ _ Therapeutic exercises _ Pectoral stretching, deep cervical flexor strengthening, and foam roller exercises. Also incorporate transversus abdominis strengtheningTherapeutic exercises _ Progress to dynamic closed-chain stabilization and ball stabilization exercisesIncorporate postural correction and core/ trunk strengthening exercises in the home exercise program Restrictions in ADLs or sportRestore prior functional capacity in ADLs or sportTherapeutic exercises _ When appropriate, introduce dynamic, multidirectional exercises that begin to resemble activities similar to typical environmentFunctional training _ Slowly reintegrate into to sport-specific trainingGradual return to sport/ activity as appropriate  ."
