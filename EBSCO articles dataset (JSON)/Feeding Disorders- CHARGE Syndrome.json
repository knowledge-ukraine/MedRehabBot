The checklist format allows for caregiver involvement in identifying risks and managing swallowing difficulties(29)In-depth  Clinical SwallowT709064A VFSS is performed when the dysphagia team has concerns about the pharyngeal phase of swallowing and the complete swallowing sequence. A VFSS is completed in collaboration with a radiologist or physiatrist.(12) Most clinical practices follow the protocol originally described by Logemann and adaptations of this protocol for infants and children described by Arvedson and Lefton-Greif.(30,31) The assessment must be age-appropriate  with regard to positioning, presentation, and viscosity of material.(12) The patient eats and drinks a variety of developmentally appropriate liquids and solids mixed with barium while images are recorded with videofluorography. All patients should be examined in the lateral and frontal positions to gain information on movements of the swallow and symmetry of bolus flow and pharyngeal wall contraction. The SLP examines for the presence of aspiration and the effectiveness of presenting different food consistencies or of modifying posture.(12) In contrast to the CSE, a VFSS provides critical information on the pharyngeal phase of the swallow.(32)Given the unnatural surroundings, swallowing function observed during a VFSS is not necessarily identical to that observed at mealtimes.(33) Other variables that may influence swallowing function include anxiety, fatigue, and medications.(34) Due to the potential harmful effects of ionizing radiation on children, a repeat VFSS should be considered only when there are specific questions that require answers from another study; a VFSS should not be used to routinely monitor changes in(34) -Lip closure (ability to contain a liquid bolus) -Lingual elevation (the back of the tongue is slightly elevated) -Tongue-to-palatal  seal -Bolus preparation/mastication -Bolus transport/movement of the tongue (movement of the bolus to the back of the oral cavity) -Initiation of the pharyngeal swallow (swallow should be initiated when the bolus reaches the region of the posterior oral cavity) -Soft palate elevation and retraction -Laryngeal elevation -Anterior hyoid excursion -Laryngeal closure -Pharyngeal contraction -Pharyngoesophageal segment opening -Tongue base retraction -Epiglottic inversion -Esophageal clearanceModified Barium SwallowT709077FEES is performed to evaluate the anatomy and physiology of the pharynx and the larynx, pharyngeal swallow function, and the patient\u2019s ability to manage secretions and swallow foods and liquids.(12) In addition, it can be used to explore a variety of diagnostic interventions, such as varying bolus consistency, varying posture, or making use of visual feedback for reinforcement.(36) After the insertion of the endoscope, the patient can engage in normal feeding behavior during the evaluation. Food must be light in color to enhance visibility (e.g., milk, puddings, yogurt, bread). FEES is preferred over VFSS when patients have safety issues related to radiation exposure or when they need retesting. Due to the invasive nature of the procedure, it might be difficult to obtain accurate representation of a normal swallow in young children.(13) The American Speech-Language-Hearing  Association has published several online documents relevant to the technical aspects of FEES and the qualifications required to perform FEES(37)  -For detailed information on FEES and endoscopic examinations for dysphagia, see  Clinical Review\u2026Dysphagia",

Given the heterogeneity of children with CHARGE syndrome, individualization of treatment is warranted and a range of different approaches for a single child often is necessary"

        "treatment summary": [
            "Oral sensory motor therapy \u2013The objectives of oral motor therapy are to increase coordination of oral motor movements to improve feeding skills and/or to increase normal sensory function during mealtimes. No studies have explored the effects of oral sensory motor therapy in individuals with CHARGE syndrome. Oral sensory motor therapy has been found to increase oral motor function (e.g., chewing, tongue lateralization, lip closure), but research is inconclusive with regard to its effect on oral feeding efficiency, caloric intake, weight gain, pharyngeal motility, and airway protection for children with feeding disorders associated with cerebral palsy (CP)(44,45,46)",
            "Positioning/postural adaptations \u2013Many children with CHARGE and dysphagia have abnormalities in posture, tone, and movement that influence feeding. In these cases, the SLP can collaborate with a PT and/or OT to determine the seating position that is most beneficial for feeding. Positioning has been found to improve oral and pharyngeal swallowing function in other children with hypotonia, including children with CP.(47) Sitting upright for a period after eating might decrease the effects of GER -For detailed information on postural changes as dysphagia treatment, see  Clinical Review\u2026Dysphagia: Swallowing Therapy \u2013Compensatory  ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T709081 ",
            "Adaptive equipment \u2013Adaptive equipment for eating and feeding therapy may include specialized teats, bottles, pacifiers, cups, spoons, and forks. The SLP might collaborate with the OT in selecting adaptive equipment for feeding",
            "Modification of liquids \u2013Liquids can be modified (e.g., thickened) to assist the child in controlling them in the oral and pharyngeal phases of the swallow and to improve the effectiveness and safety of the swallow. Trials of different liquid consistencies should be performed with instrumental assessments (VFSS, FEES). Modification of equipment such as bottles and cups may be necessary to accommodate the thickened liquids, and parents/caregivers should receive training and information regarding thickened liquids. Examples of circumstances in which thickened liquids may assist the child include:(18) -pooling of liquid in the oral cavity -poor lip closure and loss of liquid -poor tongue control, movement, and coordination -delayed initiation of the swallow -coughing/choking/gulping -clinical signs of aspiration -a history of chest infections -presence of GER -For detailed information on modifications to liquids for dysphagia treatment, see  Clinical Review\u2026Dysphagia: Swallowing Therapy \u2013Compensatory , referenced above",
            "Modification of solid foods \u2013Solid foods can be modified to assist the child in chewing and controlling the bolus. In addition, recommendations of food consistency and food type must be aligned with the family\u2019s dietary habits and culture. The following guidelines are indicators of age of nutritional readiness and oral skills for solid foods in normal development; however, the child\u2019s individual oromotor/feeding skills and food allergies must be considered when introducing new textures of foods:(18) -6 to 8 months \u2013 purees -8 to 9 months \u2013 mashed lumpy/mixed textures -Finger food -7 to 8 months and older \u2013 toast/biscuits for beginning eaters -10 to 11 months and older \u2013 soft chopped food -10 to 12 months and older \u2013 firm finger foods -15 months and older \u2013 foods that require sustained biting and chewing -For detailed information on diet modifications for dysphagia treatment, see Clinical Review\u2026Dysphagia: Swallowing Therapy \u2013Compensatory , referenced above",
            "Behavioral treatment techniques \u2013Individuals with CHARGE syndrome might exhibit inappropriate behaviors at mealtimes (e.g., tantrums) and refusal to eat or refusal to eat some food textures or types. Behaviors may initially stem from organic causes (e.g., difficulty swallowing some textures, association of food with GER), but can also be exacerbated or reinforced by environmental factors such as parental response to behaviors (e.g., coaxing, terminating mealtime).(48) Behavioral treatment should be based upon the results of a detailed functional behavior analysis of mealtime behaviors; it may include escape-avoidance extinction, positive reinforcement, and shaping techniques. These techniques have been found to be effective in treating food refusal and inappropriate mealtime behavior in children and toddlers(48,49,50) \u2013Compensatory strategies such as alternating solids and liquids and externally modifying bite and sip size might be effective for reducing aspiration risk in individuals with CHARGE syndrome who overstuff the mouth or pocket food in the cheeks(56)",
            "Feeding tubes (orogastric, nasogastric, gastrostomy, jejunostomy)/enteral feeding \u2013There is a high prevalence of feeding difficulty and of tube feeding in infants with CHARGE syndrome. Children with CHARGE syndrome who shown signs of malnutrition, aspiration associated with respiratory disease, insufficient fluid intake, or excessive stress during meals may be candidates for a feeding tube to provide an alternative nutritional source. Other considerations include the presence of GER and caregiver stress associated with mealtimes. Successful long-term management of enteral feeding depends on coordinated longitudinal care of a dysphagia team. Provision of pleasurable experiences to the mouth and face has been recommended to prevent the child from becoming orally hypersensitive while receiving nutrition by tube feeding(18)  . Problem Goal Intervention Expected Progression Home Program Inadequate oral intake for nutritional needsMeet nutritional needs of the infant or childSupplementation of oral intake _ Children with CHARGE syndrome often require more time to feed orally and thus are unable to receive adequate nutrition without supplementation. In newborns, an oral feeding should be completed within 40 to 45 minutes; by 6 months of age, a feeding should be completed in 30 minutes. An SLP can collaborate with a pediatrician or nutritionist to assist the child in meeting nutritional needs orally by documenting the child\u2019s feeding skills (timing, range of foods, and consistencies) to assist in selecting the correct way to supplement. Modifications include: small, frequent feeds(18) adding calories to feedings by using commercial additives(18) adding vitamins, minerals, and other nutritional supplements(18) using enteral feeding in addition to oral feeding(18)N/A Feeding program should be implemented at home/school  Prolonged feeding times due to disruptive feeding environmentModify feeding environment to meet the feeding needs of the individualModification of feeding environment _ The physical environment in which an individual is eating can have an impact on the duration of a meal. The feeding environment should be a calm setting in which the child can focus on feeding and swallowing. Some children might respond to the introduction of rhythm to assist in the coordination of sucking and chewing. Music or gentle rocking may assist some children in achieving better coordination of these functions(18)N/A Feeding program should be implemented at home/school  Abnormalities in the patient\u2019s posture/ muscle tone that interfere with feedingImprove positioning to attain a more adequate feeding position for the patientModification of the child\u2019s posture _ Many children with CHARGE syndrome and dysphagia have abnormalities in their posture, tone, and movement that may influence feeding.(1) In these cases, the SLP can collaborate with a PT and/or OT in providing a seating position that: is relaxed and comfortable and allows for a sustainable posture/ position(18) provides balance, stability, and mobility(18) is efficient and safe for swallowing(18) inhibits abnormal movement patterns that interfere with swallowing(18) allows for independent feeding if possible(18) provides for optimal oromotor function and control(18) reduces likelihood of fatigue for child and caregiver(18) _ Examples of positioning modifications for newborns include swaddling, specific positions (side lying, prone, more upright), and use of positioning aids.(18) For children who are eating solid foods, positioning techniques may include a pelvic strap to stabilize pelvis and hips, a footplate and/ or additional foot cuffs, a harness to support the trunk, and head/neck support.(18) All positioning equipment must be carefully chosen by the appropriately skilled members of the dysphagia team and individualized for the needs of the patient(18)N/A Feeding program should be implemented at home/school  Feeding difficulties/ dysphagiaIncrease the patient\u2019s feeding abilitiesAdaptive equipment _ Adaptive equipment for feeding includes specialized teats, bottles, pacifiers, cups, spoons, straws, and forks. When selecting special equipment for feeding, the SLP should consider early speech development and ways to facilitate that development through use of special equipment (e.g., training cup to facilitate lip closure). Other variables to consider when selecting equipment include the patient\u2019s:(18) age and size oral anatomy feeding skills medical status cognitive development preferences feeding goals motor development positioning for feeding vision skills hearing ability _ In addition, it is important to consider parent preferences as well as the durability, cost, and accessibility of the equipment.(18) A team approach is recommended for selection and trial of adaptive equipment with the patient(18)N/A Feeding program should be implemented at home/school  Oral or pharyngeal dysphagia with liquidsIncrease swallowing ability for liquidsModification of liquids _ Patients with CHARGE syndrome who experience pooling of liquid in the oral cavity, poor lip closure, poor tongue coordination, delayed initiation of oral and pharyngeal phases of swallow, or coughing/choking/ gulping might benefit from thickened liquids.
