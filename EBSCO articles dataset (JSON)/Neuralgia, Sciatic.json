            "The term sciatica describes the symptoms of sciatic nerve pain radiating down the posterior leg.(16) It has also been used to describe paresthesia from the low back to below the knee or referred to the posterior thigh, calf, and foot. Sciatica is commonly attributed only to lumbosacral radicular pain.(1) However, sciatica implies either radicular or referred lower extremity pain/paresthesia that involves a lesion of sciatic nerve root(s) or anywhere along the sciatic nerve itself",
            "Sciatica is strongly associated with low back pain (LBP), which has multiple causes including spinal pathogenesis.(6) Most commonly affected are the L4-5,  L5-S1,  and L3-4  nerve levels.(16) There is usually nerve root compression below the level of the corresponding disc(16)",
