It is the safest option for the fetus. Examples of countries with these guidelines are the United States, Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom \u2013Researchers in South Africa surveyed 1,047 men and women attending alcohol-serving  establishments and found that pregnant women (n = 53) were less likely to believe that they should not drink alcohol, and also were less likely to believe that alcohol can harm a fetus, when compared to non-pregnant  women (n = 429). Men with pregnant partners had similar findings when compared to men without pregnant partners(48) \u2013Researchers in Western Australia found that among the indigenous population a higher education level was the greatest predictor of safe drinking practices during pregnancy and that having heard of FASD was the greatest predictor of knowledge of outcomes for children with FASD(49)",
