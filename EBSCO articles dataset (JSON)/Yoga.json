            "Yoga is an Indian mind-body  practice that has been in existence for 2,000 years. It is a combination of meditation, mindfulness, self-exploration,  breathing control, and body movement designed to improve flexibility, focus, balance, and strength. There is a misconception that Yoga only provides flexibility training; studies have shown that the various yoga practices (described below) can also improve musculoskeletal strength, endurance, and balance.(52) Yoga is also considered a way of life designed to create a union of mind, body, and spirit while cultivating prana , or life force",
            "The Indian sage Patanjaliis considered the father of classic yoga. He described eight limbs of philosophy required to achieve a moral, meaningful life: yama (moral behavior), niyama (healthy habits), asana  (physical postures), pranayama (breathing exercises), pratyahara  (sense withdrawal), dharana  (concentration), dhyana (contemplation), and samadhi  (higher consciousness). Raja  yoga has strict adherence to all eight limbs(2)",
            "Yoga was introduced to the Western world starting in the 1930s and initially consisted primarily of postures ( asanas ), breathing exercises ( pranayama ), and sometimes meditation(2)",
            "Since that time, yoga has divided into different schools and brands:(35) \u2013Hatha \u2013 A general term for yoga using primarily postures as opposed to breathing or meditation exercises. Considered basic and good for beginners \u2013Vinyasa \u2013 Consists of fluid movement between postures with coordinated breathing; geared for the physically fit \u2013Iyengar \u2013 Known for its emphasis on props to maintain good body alignment. Good for less flexible patients; is accessible to anyone; training for teachers is more formal and rigorous than other disciplines \u2013Ashtanga \u2013 Movement is rapid, smooth, and vigorous; designed for athletes \u2013Bikram \u2013 Known for taking place in a heated room (over 100\u00b0 F/38\u00b0 C) to increase flexibility, it uses the same sequence of postures each time and is best for the physically fit. Also known as \u201chot yoga,\u201d Bikram yoga is more popular in the United States than in other countries \u2013Viniyoga \u2013 Uses breathing and chanting exercises with gentle postures and is considered suitable for the less fit \u2013Kundalini \u2013 A flowing style with emphasis on breathing techniques, it has more of a spiritual aspect \u2013Kripalu \u2013 Considered physically challenging, it combines breathing and postures and incorporates techniques similar to psychotherapy that address spiritual and emotional aspects  \u2013Anusara \u2013 Similar to Iyengar with emphasis on alignment, uses chanting and breathing exercises and is known for being lighthearted \u2013Sivananda \u2013 Lifestyle yoga with moderate poses, breathing, relaxation; emphasizes vegetarian diet and cheerful attitude \u2013Power \u2013 Considered to be an even more vigorous form of Ashtanga yoga \u2013YogaFit \u2013 Athletic form, popular in gyms and exercise clubs, that mixes poses with sit-ups,  push-ups,  and other exercises",
            "A 2012 survey reported that 20.4 million Americans (or 8.7% of adults in the United States) practice yoga, an increase from 15.8 million in 2008(3)",
            "It is important to choose a style of yoga appropriate to one\u2019s fitness level as well as to find an experienced teacher(1,4)",
            "There is a difference between yoga for general well-being  and \u201cyoga therapy,\u201d with the latter being prescribed by a health professional for a particular condition. This Clinical Review  will focus primarily on yoga therapy for rehabilitation, with yoga for general well-being  addressed in the \u201cMaintenance and Prevention\u201d section, below",
            "Researchers in Germany conducting a bibliometric analysis of RCTs of yoga interventions concluded that there has been a marked increase in RCTs in recent years (2011 and 2012), but that available research evidence is still sparse for most conditions(5)"

No improvements were found in the Mini BESTest, single leg stance, postural sway test, or Timed Up and Go",
            "Use with older adults \u2013Considering the possible benefit to older adults, especially in the area of fall prevention, there is a lack of RCTs in this area of research(4) \u2013Researchers in the United States who used a quasi-experimental  pretest/post-test  design concluded that a 12-week, 60-minute,  biweekly modified Kripalu yoga class benefitted postural control and mobility in community-dwelling  older adults(24) -Thirteen older adults (mean age = 72) attended at least 19 of the 24 sessions -Pre- and post-outcome  measures were postural control (using MiniBESTest [MBT]), mobility (Timed Up and Go [TUG] test), and gait speed (normal and fast). All outcomes improved significantly after the intervention -Authors suggest that activities such as yoga that require standing, sitting, and lying on the floor may be effective in improving mobility, postural control, and gait speed in community-dwelling  older adults \u2013Researchers of an RCT in the United States concluded that yoga has the potential to improve psychological health (anger, anxiety, well-being,  general self-efficacy, self-efficacy  in daily living, and overall self-control)  in older adults(34) -Ninety-eight  older adults (mean age = 74) randomly assigned to chair yoga, chair exercise, or control group. Program characteristics were modified to accommodate all participants -Classes met once per week for 45 minutes over a 6-week  period. Chair yoga was Hatha yoga (breathing, postures, mindfulness); chair exercise paralleled yoga physical movements in an attempt to separate meditation and mindfulness from physical activity; control group was assigned to waiting list and was able to choose either chair yoga or chair exercise after experiment was over -Assessment tools were State-Trait  Anger Expression Inventory, State Anxiety Inventory, Geriatric Depression Scale, Lawton\u2019s PGC Morale Scale, the General Self-Efficacy  Scale, Chronic Disease Self-Efficacy  Scale,and Self-Control Schedule -Chair yoga group had significantly better results for all outcome measures when compared to chair exercises only and control group. Authors suggest that yoga is not an alternative form of physical exercise but a preferred form for older adults as it provides both gentle and effective physical exercise as well as teaches emotional and cognitive control",
            "Pediatric \u2013Feasibility studies for both inpatient children receiving intensive chemotherapy and pediatric cancer outpatients have demonstrated that yoga is a feasible treatment for fatigue (inpatient) and health-related  quality of life (outpatient)(25,26) -Further studies are required to determine yoga\u2019s effectiveness \u2013Results from a quasi-experimental  pretest/posttest design study conducted in the United States suggest that yoga can promote self-regulation  among preschool children(27) -Twenty-nine  children (16 intervention, 13 control) were included in year-long  study of two full-day universal kindergarten classrooms. One teacher provided the yoga intervention while the other teacher did not -Intervention was a modified version of the standardized Yoga Kids curriculum incorporated into classroom activities.
