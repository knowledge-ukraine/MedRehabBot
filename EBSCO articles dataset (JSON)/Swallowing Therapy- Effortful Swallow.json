            "Effects of the effortful swallow in adult research subjects with nondisordered swallowing \u2013In a study conducted in New Zealand with 22 healthy adult subjects, researchers found that the effortful swallow maneuver was associated with a significant increase in submental muscle contraction as measured by surface electromyography and increased pharyngeal pressures when compared to a normal swallow (without increased effort)(14)  -The 22 subjects were asked to swallow saliva (dry swallows) first using a normal swallow and next using an effortful swallow while surface electrodes recorded muscle contraction of the submental muscles; a manometric catheter was inserted transnasally to record pharyngeal pressures(14) -The effortful swallow produced significantly more muscle contraction in the submental muscles, with increased pharyngeal pressure and decreased pressure within the UES (which improves UES opening)(14) -In a later study by the same researchers, they found that healthy subjects achieved the best execution of an effortful swallow maneuver when it was emphasized that the subject should increase tongue-to-palate contact when initiating the maneuver(30) \u2013In a study conducted in Japan with 18 adult male subjects with nondisordered swallowing,subjects were asked to perform 4 swallows: noneffortful dry swallow; noneffortful swallow of 5 mL of ice water; effortful dry swallow; and effortful swallow of 5 mL of ice water(15) -During the swallows, the patients had a manometric catheter that was inserted transnasally recording the pharyngeal pressure(15) -Results -Increased pharyngeal pressures during swallowing(15) -Increased UES opening during swallowing(15) -Suspected increase in contractions of the superior and inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscles during swallowing (researchers suspected this based on the increase of above pressures)(15) \u2013In a study conducted in Canada, researchers compared the tongue and submental surface electromyography of healthy younger adult women with nondisordered swallowing to that of healthy older adult women performing the effortful swallow. Researchers found that although there was a trend toward reduced maximum isometric tongue pressure in the older group, there was no significant difference based on age in lingual or submental contraction during an effortful swallow(31) \u2013A study in the United States used surface electromyography (sEMG) to compare the effects of treatment on hyoid displacement and submental muscle activity in 25 healthy adults. Researchers found that both the Mendelsohn swallow maneuver and the effortful swallow maneuver were more effective than expiratory muscle strength training (EMST) in increasing hyoid displacement and increasing submental muscle contraction(13) -EMST is a treatment program that uses a calibrated, one-way,  spring-loaded  valve to mechanically overload the patient\u2019s expiratory and submental muscles(13) \u2013In a study conducted in Canada that used the peak voltage output from a simple neck force transducer, researchers found that in healthy adult subjects the effortful and noneffortful swallows could be differentiated based on the graphs of amplitudes of peak neck force(32) -Implications of this study include using a neck force transducer to create visual biofeedback when teaching patients with dysphagia how to effectively perform an effortful swallow(32) \u2013According to the authors of an evidence-based  systematic review, the instructions on how to perform an effortful swallow varied widely across studies(11,43) -Instructions relating to \u201ctongue to palate\u201d resulted in increased suprahyoid musculature utilization, as measured by surface electrodes, and pharyngeal pressure, as measured by manometry. Instructions emphasizing use of neck or throat musculature showed greater pharyngeal constriction and longer laryngeal vestibule closure(43) -The authors of this review examined the effects of the effortful swallow maneuver on nondisordered swallowing in healthy volunteers(11) -The original goal of the effortful swallow was to maximize base of tongue retraction and improve bolus clearance in the valleculae -The authors found that the physiological effects of the effortful swallow appear to be variable; additionally, they noted the disagreement in results between some of the studies -According to most of the studies with healthy and nondisordered swallowing adults, the effortful swallow appears to increase lingual and pharyngeal pressure and decrease UES relaxation pressure during the act of swallowing -Researchers in one study, however, did not find a significant change in the pressures during the effortful swallow -Analyses of structural displacement during the effortful swallow varied, with some studies measuring increased hyoid movement and others measuring decreased hyoid movement  -The researchers in one study measured submental muscle activation via sEMG during the effortful swallow and found increased activation of these muscles during the maneuver -Further research is indicated to determine the full extent of the effects of the effortful swallow on nondisordered swallowing \u2013In a study in the United States with 40 healthy adults, researchers examined the training effects of the effortful swallow when used as an exercise.(36) Because dysphagia often results from oral and pharyngeal muscle weakness, the goal of many swallowing therapy programs is to increase the strength of these muscles. Regardless of the targeted muscle, one way to increase muscle strength is by taxing the muscle beyond its normal ability (i.e., overloading it). Because the effortful swallow requires a person to use high/extra effort when performing a swallow, this is one way to overload the tongue base, muscles of the floor of the mouth, and the pharyngeal wall muscles.(36) In this study, researchers used the Iowa Oral Performance Instrument (IOPI) to measure orofacial strength and lingual-palatal  pressures for baseline and outcome measures. In the training protocol, researchers randomized the first 33 patients into either an effortful swallow preceded by high-effort  straw sips group or an effortful swallow preceded by tongue elevation group. The last 7 patients were assigned to an effortful swallow in isolation group. All 3 groups of participants were instructed to perform 3 sets/10 repetitions of their assigned exercises daily for 4 weeks. Participants also kept logs of exercise to document compliance. Although exercise adherence was not one of the primary research questions, the authors of the study did note that, overall, compliance was suboptimal and therefore worth documenting. For the changes in muscle strength and lingua-palatal pressures, the researchers reported the following findings: -Anterior lingua-palatal  pressures of swallowing increased significantly in all 3 exercise condition groups. Both normal and effortful swallows were assessed,and the increase in pressures of the effortful swallows was higher than the increase of the typical swallow -The strength of the tongue maximum isometric pressure increased, but not significantly, for all 3 groups after training -There were no significant differences in orofacial strength or lingua-palatal  pressures between the 3 different groups after training (i.e., all 3 conditions were equally beneficial) -Use of the high-effort  straw sips in addition to the effortful swallow did not result in increased strength of interlabial compression maximum isometric pressure",
            "Effect of the effortful swallow in patients with dysphagia \u2013Authors of an evidence-based  systematic review examining the effects of the effortful swallow in patients with head and neck cancer reported that the effortful swallow appeared to increase the pressure between the base of the tongue and the posterior pharyngeal wall during the maneuver of the swallow(12) -For 3 participants of the studies included in the review, the effortful swallow maneuver resulted in pressures between the base of the tongue and posterior pharyngeal wall close to those measured in nondisordered swallows(12) -Authors of the review concluded that the effortful swallow maneuver may be the most helpful for head and neck cancer patients with reduced base of the tongue to pharyngeal wall contact due to the effects of cancer, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and/or surgery(12) \u2013In a study in South Korea with 19 stroke survivors with dysphagia, researchers investigated the use of resistive electrical stimulation in combination with the effortful swallow to improve pharyngeal constriction. There was no control group in this study. Each participant was treated 5 days per week for 4 weeks in 20-minute  sessions using resistive electrical stimulation over the infrahyoid muscles (strap muscles/anterior neck) and instructed to perform effortful swallows. The outcome measure for this study was the pharyngeal constriction ratio (PCR). PCR is calculated by measuring the pharyngeal area (including any bolus residue) that is visible in the lateral view of a VFSS at the point of maximum pharyngeal constriction during the swallow and dividing this by the area of the pharynx while a 1-cc bolus is held in the oral cavity. Researchers found that the PCR was significantly smaller after this training program, indicating that it was effective for improving pharyngeal constriction in these patients with dysphagia. Additional, larger studies with control groups are necessary to confirm this outcome(40) \u2013In a study, investigators explored impacts of sEMG use as biofeedback for training effortful swallow. They compared results of 15 persons post stroke to 85 healthy participants 18\u201385  years old. Both groups produced increased muscle activity for effortful swallow compared to normal swallow. The authors questioned if older patients might produce significant increases in muscle activity compared to younger participants, but found there was no effect of age. They determined that effortful swallow is a beneficial dysphagia exercise to increase muscle activity and that the use of sEMG biofeedback further enhances a patient\u2019s performance. Larger studies are needed to further investigate the findings(42) \u2013Authors of a systematic review compared impact of effortful swallow on post swallow pharyngeal residue in post stroke, head and neck cancer, and Parkinson\u2019s disease patients. They found that clearance of residue was not seen in patients  post stroke nor in head and neck cancer patients, but fewer signs/symptoms of pharyngeal residue were demonstrated in the Parkinson\u2019s patients. A major limitation of the study involving Parkinson\u2019s patients was utilizing a clinical swallow examination to determine outcomes without instrumental assessment. Overall, the review authors concluded that more studies on populations with disordered swallowing is required(43) .
