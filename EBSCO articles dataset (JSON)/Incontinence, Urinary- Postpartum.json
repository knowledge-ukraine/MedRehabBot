            "Urinary incontinence (UI) refers to an involuntary loss or leakage of urine. UI is a common health concern among adult women.(1) The main types are(1) \u2013Stress UI: leakage when coughing, laughing, or with physical exertion \u2013Urge UI: leakage when the ability to control flow is overtaken by an abrupt strong desire to urinate; associated with pelvic floor muscle (PFM) spasm, detrusor instability, and nocturia/enuresis \u2013Mixed UI: leakage during conditions of either or both stress and urge",
            "The prevalence and severity of UI increase with pregnancy and symptoms commonly worsen in some women during pregnancy. (2,3,4,5,42) At least one half of pregnant women experience mildtomoderate pregnancy-related  UI (PRUI), although the leakage is often not considered bothersome.(4,5) Symptoms of PRUI may persist postpartum(2,3,4,5,38)",
            "Authors of a survey (N = 75) in Denmark found that 59% of new mothers noted mild PRUI and most of these had additional leakage on physical activity, coughing, or sneezing consistent with stress UI during the first 3 months postpartum. Half of those with PRUI had bothersome symptoms that sometimes caused embarrassment and interfered with visiting places that lacked easy access to toilets, wearing clothes that might show leakage, sexual relations, and participation in recreational physical activities(6)",
            "PFM dysfunction is a major contributor to PRUI.(39) Moderately strong evidence supports a program of intensive PFM training (PFMT) before, during, or after pregnancy as safe and effective for management of stress, urge, or mixed UI(5,7,8,9)"

            "Pelvic floor tissue damage during stressful vaginal delivery may involve the LAM and pudendal nerve.(14) Because theurethra is embedded in the anterior vaginal wall, overstretching during forceps-assisted  delivery may damage the pudendalnerve and reduce voluntary control of the external urethral sphincter(11)",
            "In animal models that simulate childbirth injury, vaginal distension is associated with denervation of the external urethralsphincter. Both vaginal distension and pudendal nerve crush injury decrease the leak point pressure, a measure of urethralresistance to leakage(15)",
            "The PFMs form a diaphragm to support the pelvic organs and also contribute to closure of the urethra sphincter. Thebladder neck and urethra are supported by the pelvic diaphragm. Poor tone, weakness, or unresponsiveness of the PFMsafter pregnancy may allow increased abdominal pressure to move the bladder neck from the proper urogenital angledownward into the position of urination. This straightening of the urethra may predispose individuals to stress UI. PFMT isbased on the assumption that strengthening and improving motor control of the pelvic floor can reduce PRUI(12,13)"

            "Authors of a study (N = 57) in Canada found that treatment success (less than 2grams leakage in 20-minute  pad test) in a PFMT program for women with postpartum stress UI was associated with having pretreatment PFM weakness, as indicated by reduced passive intravaginal force on dynamometry(27) "

        "other considerations": [
            "Authors of a comprehensive review of the literature found that a PFMT program can be recommended both during pregnancy and in the postnatal period for lessening the severity of P RUI. Specific guidelines for PFMT are not yet established  (50) \u2013V oluntary elevation of the pelvic floor due to PFM contraction is the proposed mechanismfor improving urinary continence. PFMT may promote (50) -higher resting position of the bladder -closure of the levator hiatus -reduced pubovisceral length -build-up  of PFM volume",
            "Authors of an RCT (N = 97 Caucasian healthy nulliparae in uncomplicated pregnancies) found that prenatal high-  and low-impact  aerobic exercises are consistent with improved quality of life related to UI. PFMT is effective in patients with good control of their PFM activity. The safety of high-impact exercises during pregnancy has not been established (51)",
            "Authors of a 2014 systematic review of 22 trials (N = 8,485) found that intensive antenatal (preventive) PFMT is associated with a lower incidence of PRUI for up to 6 months after delivery in women who are continent before pregnancy(5)",
            "Supervised postpartum PFMT for reducing PRUI in the short term is supported by numerous high-quality  RCTs, none of which reported serious adverse outcomes (5,7,8,28,49)",
            "Authors of an RCT(N = 168) in the United Kingdom involving primigravidae with bladder neck hypermobility (Valsalva test) found that PFMT from 20 weeks until delivery was effective in reducing postpartum stress UI(29)",
            "Some postnatal women with pelvic organ prolapse may be eligible for PFMT. Authors of a study (N = 47) in the United Kingdom found that women with symptomatic stage I or II pelvic organ prolapse were significantly more likely to have an improved prolapse stage and were significantly more likely to say their prolapse was better after PFMT(30)",
            "Hands-on  coaching by a continence specialist is often required to isolate contraction of the pelvic floor and to suppress the activation of accessory muscles (lower abdominal, gluteal, and thigh muscles)(5,28)",
            "Accurate manual assessment of PFM function and strength during treatment may require vaginal palpation by a continence specialist(31)",
            "Authors of an RCT (N = 264 women with PRUI) in the Netherlands found that the prevalence of UI was not different between women who received PFMT and those who had usual care.(32) However, as in any physical training program, successful outcomes after PFMT depend on patient compliance with the exercise guidelines. Less than 37% of the intervention group in this study trained at the prescribed intensity",
            "Based on an in-house  2011 systematic review, the Joanna Briggs Institute recommends the following PFMT practice(33) \u2013Confirm that the PFM exercises are performed correctly \u2013Encourage the exercises both during and after pregnancy \u2013Pay particular attention to women with antenatal and/or postnatal UI \u2013Incorporate at least two supervised, individual-instruction  sessions into the program \u2013Design a practical, daily home program \u2013Provide follow-up  contact postpartum, either by telephone, electronic communication, or home visits",
            "Clinicians should confirm that patients receiving PFMT perform the exercises correctly at the intensity, duration, and frequency prescribed in the treatment plan. The lack of individualized correction of faulty PFM contraction may explain  why authors of an RCT (N = 105) in Norway found that PFMT taught in a general fitness class (1 hour, 2 times per week, 12 weeks) did not reduce symptoms of PRUI(34)",
            "Authors of a 2005 systematic review found that the effectiveness of and adherence to PFMT programs after pregnancy may depend on the following variables:(35) \u2013One-to-one  instruction with a healthcare professional (generally a physical therapist) \u2013A number of regularly scheduled instructional sessions \u2013Feedback on the correctness of PFM contractions \u2013Provision of take-home  materials (pamphlets, tapes, and diaries)",
            "Authors of a controlled cohort study (N = 66) in Thailand found that PFMT (supervised exercises for 45 minutes once every 2 weeks for 6 weeks and a handbook with detailed instructions for performing 20 sets of the exercises twice daily) reduced the severity of stress PRUI symptoms and the frequency and volume of urine leakage(36) \u2013On follow-up  after 6 weeks, the PFMT group reported significantly fewer symptoms of stress UI and lower frequency and volume of urine leakage than the controls",
            "Authors of a prospective study (N = 413) in Spain found that stress PRUI persisted in 6.9% of participants at 6 months postpartum and that a program of PFM exercises for 3 months was associated with significantly improved symptoms in these women(40)",
            "Electrical stimulation may be effective to assist non-pregnant  women initiate strong contractions for PFMT.(37) However, more research is warranted",
            "A 2014 clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians recommends PFMT as first-line  treatment for women with stress UI and PFMT with bladder training as first-line  treatment for women with mixed UI prior to pregnancy(41) .
