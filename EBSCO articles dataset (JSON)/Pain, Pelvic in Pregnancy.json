            "Pelvic pain often develops during the first trimester. During this time, relaxin levels are elevated, resulting in ligamentouslaxity, which often leads to instability of the pelvic joints. If this is not compensated for (e.g., by altered neuromotorcontrol), pain in and around the symphysis pubis and the sacroiliac joints might result. In cases of more severe pain, awaddling gait might develop and ambulation and weight-bearing  are poorly tolerated. Prolonged sitting, standing, andtransfers are also antalgic and difficult"

These were mainly prescribed by their general practitioner (40%) or selfprescribed  or purchased overthecounter (OTC) (39%) The authors concluded that the high use of painkillers for managing pregnancy-related  low back and pelvic pain was of concern, given that no medication is considered 100% safe during pregnancy.

Clinician provides manual compression through the knee along the longitudinal axis of the femur.(9) A positive test (pain, unwillingness to perform) indicates posterior pelvic involvement.(10) This test can help differentiate between LBP and pelvic pain(11)With patient supine and with lower extremity extended, patient attempts to raise the leg off the table, maintaining full knee extension. The physical therapist (PT) and patient both rate ease and ability to perform the ASLR. Location of pain can help identify pelvic pain in pregnancy and is correlated with pelvic joint mobility and hip strength(11)Patient supine and hip is flexed, abducted, and externally rotated, with the heel resting on the opposite kneecap.(10) Low back or buttock pain might indicate sacroiliac joint involvement. The PT lowers the test knee towards the plinth; if the knee remains above the opposite leg, hip or SI joint involvement might be present(12)With the patient lying supine, the examiner places the heels of his or her hands on the patient\u2019s inferior pubic rami and then pushes his or her hands together, creating a shearing force. A positive sign for symphysis pubis pathology is the production of pain in the symphysis pubis(12)The patient stands on one leg and flexes the hip and knee to 90\u00b0. Pain in the symphysis is a positive test(1)Patient lies supine, flexes hip/knee and draws it towards the chest by clasping the knee with both hands. The patient is then shifted to the side of the examining table so the opposite leg extends over the edge. The examiner can then place stress on both SI joints simultaneously(1)Palpation of the long dorsal ligament (bilaterally). A positive test is pain upon palpation. A positive test is highly correlated with a positive P4 test result and posterior pelvic pain in pregnancy.(11) Palpation of LDL is performed with patient in prone in postpartum women and with patient in side-lying  in pregnant women(1) -The LDL test was found to have a sensitivity of 76%, which increases to 86% when combined with the ASLR.(9) Recommendations from the investigators of a study that examined the efficacy of 48 different measures included the use of hip adductor strength measurements and the ASLR(13) \u2013Researchers in Sweden found that self-administration  of tests for pelvic girdle pain is possible and might be useful to identify women at risk for persistent pelvic girdle pain after pregnancy(27) -Agreement between self-administered  tests performed at home and tests performed by an examiner was highest for the P4 for posterior pelvic girdle pain -A significantly lower number of positive Trendelenburg tests, ASLR tests, and SLR tests were recorded by the examiner compared to the self-administered  ones \u2013The palpation of 13 landmarks (the coccyx, the lateral part of sacrum at the insertion of the sacrospinous ligament, the middle part of the sacrospinous ligament, the insertion of the sacrospinous ligament at the ischial spine, the ischium inferior to the ilio-ischial  fusion, and the lateral and medial part of the pubic bone) produced greater pain in women with chronic pelvic pain after pregnancy compared with postpartum women without chronic pelvic pain(37)",

Positive results were mostly found whenever exercise therapy and education were utilized for treatment \u2013However, the authors did note that their conclusions were more applicable to patients with lumbopelvic pain than those with pelvic girdle pain due to the lack of differentiating between the two populations in some of the studies. The authors also suggested that uncovering effective physical therapy interventions is more important than differentiating between lumbopelvic pain and pelvic girdle pain",
