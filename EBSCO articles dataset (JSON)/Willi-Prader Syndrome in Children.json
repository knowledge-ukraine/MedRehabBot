            "There is no cure for PWS, which is a lifelong disorder that will affect the child and the primary caregiver/s over their lifespan. Certain symptoms may persist and be of greater concern at different ages and stages of development. Primary caregivers should discuss with the healthcare specialist recommendations and options regarding vocational training, higher education, independent living/group home options, and transitioning to the care of healthcare professionals who treat adults",
            "Early intervention services for gross and fine motor developmental milestone facilitation, therapeutic strengthening, positioning and handling techniques, and parent education is important ",
            "PWS requires long-term  medical management to address obesity and the conditions associated with obesity, muscle weakness, behavior/psychological impairments, and cognitive impairments. Children with PWS have a shortened life expectancy due to complications of morbid obesity(2) \u2013There is an increased risk for developing type II diabetes mellitus, thrombophlebitis, hypertension, right-sided  heart failure, peripheral edema, and elevated cholesterol during adolescence due to morbid obesity, hyperphagia, decreased activity level, and food obsession \u2013These cardiovascular risk factors contribute to increased morbidity and mortality rates compared to those of peers without PWS \u2013Careful weight management by dietary control, exercise, behavioral management, and pharmaceutical therapy is key to reducing cardiovascular risk factors and can increase patients\u2019 life expectancy, enabling many to live well into older adulthood and even into their seventh decade",
            "Puberty is delayed or incomplete, and most individuals with PWS are unable to have children \u2013However, contraception should be considered in those women who may have the potential for fertility (hormone levels, menses)(12)",
            "Behavioral and psychiatric problems interfere the most with quality of life as these children enter adulthood(2)"

Parents may also seek out behavior modification therapy in conjunction with occupational therapy \u2013Speech and language development may also be delayed primarily with articulation (nasal and/or slurred speech)(2) Special education services may be recommended to facilitate optimal learning within the classroom setting due to mild to moderate learning delay as well as any behavior or emotional issues. An IEP may be needed \u2013Academic performance typically is poorer than cognitive ability would suggest. Some evidence suggests that those with uniparental disomy PWS have somewhat higher verbal IQ than those with deletions, although performance scores on IQ tests are similar(2) \u2013Most children will require either placement in a special education classroom or special assistance (aide) in a regular classroom. Both inclusion and self-contained classroom settings have been effective learning environments for children with PWS. The ideal classroom setting will depend on the individual\u2019s level of skills and extent of behavior disorder(2) \u2013Formal social skills training is invaluable since most of these children have difficulty reading social cues and maintaining friendships with peers(2) Registered dietician/nutritionist should be consulted due to the high likelihood of developing hyperphagia, central obesity, and diabetes(2) \u2013In early infancy, primary caregivers should be instructed not to restrict fats due to fear of future obesity because fats are important for neurodevelopment and growth(2) \u2013Recommendations need to be made to the primary caregivers regarding strict dietary control and food restrictions. Most children are placed on very strict diets \u2013Strict mealtime routines are also recommended so the child develops confidence that the next meal will be served on time \u2013Parents are advised to provide a healthy diet for their child with proper proportions. High-sugar,  high-fat, high-sodium, and junk foods should be avoided Refer to orthopedist if therapist suspects scoliosis, kyphosis, or hip dysplasia. In some studies, GH therapy has been linked to the development of scoliosis(2) Refer to neuropsychologist regarding any emotional or behavioral concerns. Behavior modifications and changes in eating habits should be addressed \u2013Psychotic disorders occur in at least 6\u201312%  of individuals with PWS based on several studies; however, in a more recent population-based  study in the United Kingdom, 28% of the adults with PWS presented with a psychotic disorder(2) -Onset is often in young adulthood, and a significant proportion of these individuals present with cycloid psychosis -Individuals who have a 15q deletion have more numerous and more severe behavioral disturbances  \u2013Clinical management of children with PWS should include primary caregiver education regarding the management of any repetitive or rigid behaviors in conjunction with treatment interventions to control hyperphagia and any negative associated behaviors",

            "Physical therapy intervention should be directed toward increasing muscle strength, aerobic endurance, postural control, movement efficiency, developmentally age-appropriate  gross and fine motor skills, bilateral coordination, and balance in order to maximize function, minimize cardiovascular risk factors, reduce the risk of osteoporosis, and manage obesity",
            "As the child ages, physical therapy will remain an important component of the child\u2019s routine. Depending on the child\u2019s needs, direct physical therapy services may wax and wane; however, it is important to educate the primary caregivers on the importance of daily physical activity and developmentally age-appropriate activities that can assist with strengthening, bilateral coordination, balance, and cardiorespiratory endurance. This will help with weight-management  and energy levels",

Activities focus on age-appropriate  and goal-oriented  physical activities including playground games and interactive games such as the Nintendo Wii. Both groups participated in 4 days of physical activity per week for 24 weeks with durations ranging from 25 minutes to 45 minutes per day -Each session included warm-up  exercises, strengthening exercises, and games \u2013Results at the end of 24 weeks show a significant improvement in cardiometabolic markers for insulin resistance, lipids, and inflammatory parameters for the NSO group, but no changes for those with PWS with the exception of improvement in interleukin\u20138  factors",

        "Genetic counseling should be provided to the parents, especially if they are considering having more children",
        "Parents/primary caregivers must adhere to strict dietary controls since evidence indicates that any relaxation of parental control has deleterious effects on the child\u2019s BMI once an eating problem has been identified. It is wise to implement dietary controls prior to observing obesity and eating problems since obesity may develop prior to the increased interest in food(2) Behavior modification techniques are needed to address food stealing within the home and community by children with PWS Parents/primary caregivers need to seek support from the child\u2019s community (teachers, friends, other family members) regarding the necessity to adhere to the child\u2019s strict dietary guidelines Relatives, friends, and teachers must be educated on the child\u2019s dietary program in order to provide the optimal environment for the child when away from the primary caregivers. It is important for family members to understand that the child\u2019s insatiable desire for food may be so intense that he or she will seek it at any cost. Inpatient treatment settings may be required if the family is unable to cope with the child\u2019s behavior Holidays and most celebrations often involve food. Such events may need to be modified and celebrated differently so that food is not the center of the event",
        "In addition to dietary controls/modifications, children with PWS need encouragement to participate in daily physical activity. Family support is key to adherence Parents/primary caregivers need to discourage the use of television and video games and encourage physical activity Family commitment and participation will increase the likelihood of the child\u2019s willingness to participate in physical activity such as going for daily walks, riding a bicycle, and swimming These activities should always include the child\u2019s interests and be compatible with the family\u2019s routine as much as possible An activity log may be of added benefit and motivation for the child to participate and comply",
        "V ocational planning is essential. Most of these individuals require sheltered work or work with a job coach. Optimal work settings involve a physical activity and absence of exposure to available food. Suggestions are landscaping, mail delivery, and working in a florist shop(2)",
        "As these children enter adulthood, despite relatively mild mental impairments the overwhelming majority are unable to live completely independently in their own homes. Group homes specifically designed for individuals with PWS may be the best option because everyone will be on low-calorie  diets, food is inaccessible, and behavior limits are strictly enforced(2)"
