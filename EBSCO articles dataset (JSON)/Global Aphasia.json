In this study, there were two groups of patients, experimental (who received the prescribed-very-early  aphasia rehabilitation as soon as possible after a stroke, mean of 6.1 days poststroke) and a historical control group from a previous study. There were patients in this study in both groups with mild to severe aphasia of varying types. At the conclusion of the study, the researchers controlled the data for initial aphasia and stroke disability and found that those participants who underwent the prescribed-very-early  aphasia rehabilitation achieved 18% greater recovery on the Aphasia Quotient (AQ) and 1.5% higher scores on the Discourse Analysis (DA) than those in the historical control cohort. At 6 months postintervention, the experimental participants maintained a 16% higher score on the AQ and a 0.6% (not statistically significant) higher score on DA scores over the control group(60)",

            "Treatment for communication deficits associated with a variety of types of aphasia \u2013Authors of a systematic, quantitative review of 39 RCTs examined the effectiveness of speech and language therapy for aphasia following a stroke and presented the following results: -There is evidence of the effectiveness of speech and language therapy following stroke for improving receptive and expressive language as well as functional communication abilities(31) -Results favored more intensive treatment over conventional treatment; however, the attrition rate was higher for intensive treatments (e.g., constraint-induced  aphasia treatment)(31) -No conclusions could be made regarding the relative effectiveness of group vs. one-on-one treatment(31) -No specific type of speech therapy intervention was found to be more effective than another(31) \u2013Authors of a meta-analysis  of 55 multiple-subject  studies found that the average effect size for recovery of treated patients with aphasia in the acute period was nearly double that of the recovery of untreated patients (i.e., treated recovery vs. spontaneous recovery).(32) These findings confirmed the results of an earlier, smaller meta-analysis  (N = 21) by the same author(33)  \u2013In a systematic review that included 21 RCTs of aphasia therapy that was initiated more than 6 months poststroke in patients with a range of aphasia types, authors found evidence to support the effectiveness of the following therapies for aphasia in the chronic phase of stroke recovery: computer-based  treatments, constraint-induced aphasia therapy (CIAT), high intensity of aphasia therapy, group language therapy, trained conversational partner community-based  programs, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).(44) Additionally, the authors found good evidence to support adjunct use of piracetam, donepezil, galantamine, and memantine in aphasia therapy for patients in the chronic phase of stroke recovery; bromocriptine was not found to be effective(44) -In a narrative review of 12 studies that examined the use of computer-based  treatment for aphasia, the authors found that overall, participants experienced an improvement in measures of language ability, such as the WAB. Despite the heterogeneity of the studies and severity of deficits of participants, this study suggests that patients may benefit from the intensity of therapy and independence that computer-based  therapy can provide (70) -In a case study with a 58-year-old  female patient with nonfluent aphasia, researchers provided speech-language therapy alone and then in combination with bromocriptine. Outcome measures were performed at the following times: (1) at baseline before the drug was administered; (2) once the drug reached 30 mg dosage; (3) after the combined speech-language  therapy and drug regimen; and (4) after drug and therapy withdrawal. The patient made some measurable improvements on bromocriptine without therapy; however, when she began combined speech-language therapy and bromocriptine,she showed significant improvements on standardized testing and overall behavior/verbal output. Researchers noted that these gains were maintained after the patient stopped taking the drug(53) \u2013In a systematic review including 26 studies that involved treatment of aphasia (of various types) by targeting production of verbs, authors concluded that verb therapy within the context of single words or sentences is effective, irrespective of the specific verbs targeted.(46) With the exception of three participants in individual studies included in the review, all participants improved in outcome measures of language when treated with verb therapy(46) \u2013In a study conducted in Italy with eight patients with moderate to severe chronic aphasia (five of whom were classified as having Broca\u2019s aphasia and three with \u201csevere non-classifiable\u201d  aphasia), researchers found significant improvements on trained sentences as well as generalization to untrained sentence production after participating in an intensive 6\u201310  week therapeutic intervention focused on improvement of syntactic structure(48) -Therapy program was administered in six stages, each involving the training of sentences of increasing complexity with subject, verb, object, and sometimes prepositional phrases(48) -Sessions took place 60 minutes at a time, twice per day, 5 times per week(48) -Outcomes were assessed in the time it took participants to correctly produce 20 clauses in 16 lists in both training battery and untrained battery; outcomes were measured immediately after therapy as well as another time 6\u201312  months post-therapy -The two batteries of training sentences were tested with healthy controls and no differences emerged in the performance on either task battery for these individuals; each list took controls slightly over 33 minutes to produce(48) -Significant improvements in training battery were found immediately after therapy as well as 6\u201312  months after therapy. As a group, the participants with aphasia required an average of 170.01 \u00b1 36.9 minutes to produce the first test battery (which was then trained in therapy). Immediately after therapy, the group of participants produced the lists in an average of 86.74 \u00b1 30.94 minutes. At the follow-up evaluation, the group required 92.76 \u00b1 20.5 minutes to produce all of the trained clauses(48) -Significant improvements were also found on the lists of untrained clauses. At baseline, untrained items were produced in an average of 173.26 \u00b1 44.62 minutes. After therapy, these untrained items were produced by the group in an average of 104.09 \u00b1 34.47 minutes immediately after therapy and 115.57 \u00b1 26.19 minutes 6\u201312  months after the therapy concluded(48) \u2013The primary purpose of aphasia therapy is the improvement of communication, with the goal of increasing participation in daily activities and enhancing quality of life. Intervention should consider patient interests, patient and caregiver goals, and contextual factors(20)",
            "Group therapy:  Group therapy may include pragmatic objectives such as improving ability to convey a message and initiating conversational exchanges. In addition, group therapy may offer support for the individual, provide information about aphasia, and increase the patient\u2019s confidence in communicative situations. The effects of group therapy on persons with chronic aphasia were investigated in an RCT with two groups, immediate treatment and delayed treatment.(34) Group  therapy was provided by an SLP for 5 hours/week (2.5 hour periods/2 days a week) for 4 months. The control group participated in social activities (support, performance, movement groups) to control for the effects of social interaction. The first part of group therapy involved discussions of interest for the patients. Information exchange was facilitated by communicative drawing, role-playing,  natural gestures, maps, pictures, personal notebooks, conversational prompting, and scripting. A break for refreshments included family members. The last part of the group session was spent wrapping up the initial discussion or talking about news events. Dependent measures included standardized tests: WAB AQ, CADL, and Shortened Porch Index of Communicative Ability (SPICA). Results indicated that the immediate treatment group had significantly higher scores on the measures than the group not receiving treatment. Within-group  performance revealed significant increases after 2 months of treatment and after 4 months of treatment. No significant decline occurred 1 month post treatment(34)",
            "Supported conversation \u2013According to the Aphasia Rehabilitation Best Practice Statements 2014, SLPs should train caregivers and family members of patients with aphasia in strategies to be competent and supportive communication partners(69) \u2013Authors of a systematic review of the methodology of communication partner training studies for persons with aphasia found that the methodological quality of these studies is highly varied.(51) Overall, authors reported that communication partner training studies had poor treatment fidelity (i.e., the methods used to examine and enhance the reliability and validity of behavioral interventions tested)(51) \u2013In a Canadian single-blind  RCT, researchers investigated the effects of training of volunteers (N = 40 volunteers) on the conversational interaction of patients with aphasia.(35) Training included a 1-day  workshop and 1.5 hours of hands-on  experience to teach volunteers skills such as keeping talk natural and avoiding being patronizing. They were also taught to ensure comprehension of the patient and use techniques such as gesture, drawing, pictographic resources, and writing key words. Measures were researcher-developed  and designed to improve the skill of the conversational partner in \u201cacknowledging and revealing the competence of adults with aphasia.\u201d Another researcher-developed  measure assessed the level of interaction of the patient. Trained volunteers scored higher than untrained volunteers on ratings of acknowledging competence and revealing competence. Persons with aphasia showed change in social and message exchange skills.(35) Other intervention studies support direct training of family members and other partners to improve communication of both participants(36,37) \u2013In a study conducted in Finland with 34 persons with aphasia and their communication partners, researchers found that communication skills and efficiency improved after a partner-focused  intervention, Communication Therapy for People with Aphasia and their Partners (APPUTE)(52) -The aim of APPUTE is to practice functional communication strategies in a structured program with individualized guidance from an SLP. Both the person with aphasia and the communication partner are actively involved in therapy. The program involves three different types of communication tasks arranged hierarchically: tasks involving pictures with objects and activities, detailed situational pictures, and events from the news(52) -In each session and at each level of task, the SLP and person with aphasia start the session alone, during which time the therapist explains the task and the patient is shown the pictures/objects/news stories. When the partner joins the session, the SLP guides both conversation partners in strategy use to increase communication efficacy and accuracy(52) -In this study, the APPUTE program was provided over the course of two 14-day  intensive rehabilitation periods at 6-month  intervals and outcomes were measured 6 months after the end of the second rehabilitation period(52) -Outcomes were measured by the WAB-R,  Communication Effectiveness Index, Communication Skill Evaluation (CSE), Couple Communication Scale-B,  and APPUTE evaluation questionnaires for both partners(52) -Significant improvements in communication skills were found on the WAB-R  for the persons with aphasia and the CSE for the conversation partners. Communication efficacy of the persons with aphasia as measured by the CETI improved significantly. Communication skills of the dyads improved significantly as measured by the CSE. Although the goal of the program was not to improve linguistic skills of the persons with aphasia (it was to improve functional communication between partners), researchers found improvements, especially with respect to verbal naming(52) \u2013Constraint-induced  language therapy (CILT)/constraint-induced  aphasia therapy (CIAT) : based on the principles of constraint-induced  movement therapy (CIMT) for motor rehabilitation following stroke(61) -Principles of CILT include: -Constraint: not allowing the patient to use compensatory strategies for communication (e.g., drawing, writing, gesturing)(61)  -Forced use: forcing the use of speech during communicative exchanges(61) -Massed practice: participating in therapy in high, concentrated doses (such as 2\u20134 hours per day, 4\u20135 days per week)(61) -In an RCT conducted in Germany with 100 subjects with aphasia (including three with global aphasia), researchers compared the effects of a modified CILT program to standard aphasia therapy (n = 50 in each group). Both groups demonstrated significant improvements in language ability; in fact, the magnitude of improvements was equal for both groups. Additionally, improvements were maintained at a 1-year  follow-up(61) -For detailed information on CILT, see Clinical Review\u2026Aphasia: Constraint-Induced  Language Therapy ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T902529 \u2013Semantic Feature Analysis (SFA)",
            "Treatment studies with participants with global aphasia",
            "Semantic Feature Analysis (SFA) : SFA is a treatment approach that utilizes a target word and focuses on features (e.g., properties, category, location, shape) that contribute to the target word\u2019s meaning. In a single-participant  study of the use of a modified SFA with an individual with global aphasia, researchers found evidence that this treatment approach facilitated auditory comprehension of treatment items as well as generalization to other semanticallyrelated items within the same category (71) \u2013Computer-based  Visual Input Communication (C-VIC):  The C-VIC  sentence production training program is a computer-based  program that involves learning specific iconic vocabulary to produce sentences/phrases for communication. Researchers investigating the use of C-VIC for patients with severe, global aphasia have found that patients may improve their ability to manipulate graphic symbols and produce sentences with C-VIC,  but there is little evidence to indicate that patients are able to use C-VIC  to communicate effectively in everyday interactions(38,39) \u2013Multimodal Communication Program for Aphasia (MCPA) : MCPA is based on a treatment program that was developed for patients with chronic aphasia called Multimodal Communication Training (MCT).(68) MCT focuses on having patients with aphasia utilize multiple communication strategies (e.g., speaking, gesturing, writing, pointing) for single concepts in an effort to connect nonverbal representations to the language system. MCPA is based on the principles of MCT but was modified for use in acute stroke rehabilitation. In a study conducted in the United States with two subjects, one of whom exhibited global aphasia, researchers found that functional communication improved slightly after treatment with MCPA (more so for the patient with Broca\u2019s aphasia than for the patient with global aphasia). Each patient participated in an inpatient acute rehabilitation program that included 3 to 6 hours daily of physical, occupational, and speech therapy in addition to 14 to 16 research intervention sessions. In the MCPA intervention, patients were taught to use speaking, gesturing, writing, pointing to a communication board, and drawing to name pictures and express ideas. At the end of the intervention, the patient with global aphasia continued to make errors in speaking and writing responses for almost all probes; however, the patient was able to complete pointing and drawing tasks with up to 100% accuracy in some probes. Given the short period of intervention and small subject pool, researchers could not make conclusions regarding efficacy; however, they believed that MCPA warranted further research for patients with aphasia of all types(68) \u2013Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC): The authors of an alternating treatment single-subject  study examined the effects of two types of conversation books on patients\u2019 participation in conversation with a nonimpaired conversational partner (an SLP).(3) One book contained pictographic symbols representing topics such as place of origin, family, recent and past events, hobbies, and religion. The other book contained the same topics represented in remnants, actual objects depicting present or past events. Results indicated that patients communicated more with either type of communication book and initiated topics only when communication books were available. In addition, interactions were observed to be more enjoyable and comfortable for the conversational partner -For detailed information on an AAC assessment for with aphasia, see Clinical Review\u2026Augmentative and Alternative Communication: Aphasia , referenced above \u203aAAC considerations",
            "Interventions using AAC often are selected for patients with global aphasia because traditional therapy can be ineffective in achieving functional communication.(3) The following AAC systems have been used with patients with global aphasia: gesture or pantomime, drawing, graphic symbols, and speech-generating  devices.(3) Barriers to using AAC include: \u2013Patient might not understand the meaning of a picture symbol representing an abstract concept \u2013Patient might not have the cognitive ability to initiate the use of symbols without the help of a conversational partner \u2013Patient\u2019s spouse or caregiver might be reluctant to use the AAC  .
