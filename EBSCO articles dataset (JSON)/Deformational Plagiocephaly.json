Before that, repositioning therapy should be used. Use of CRO should be considered at 5 months in cases of moderate DP. In general, CRO is used in mild cases of DP only if the parents pursue this option \u2013If CMT is present, early diagnosis (< 3 months) and treatment is important in the form of stretching and/or PT. It is important that the parents understand that the use of the CRO does not address the problem of CMT Guidelines from the Congress of Neurological Surgeons Plagiocephaly Guideline Task Force recommend the use of CRO only with moderate to severe cases of DP that have not responded to conservative treatment(3)",

            "The aim of physical therapy is to educate caregivers regarding DP and to teach them exercises, positioning, and/handling techniques that will assist with reshaping the head and address any underlying concerns regarding ROM and strength due to torticollis or positional head preference \u2013Authors of a research study suggest use of CRO in patients with cranial asymmetries as early as possible in order to achieve the best results in CV AI and diagonal difference (DD)(12) -Based on a retrospective study in Brazil -Fifty-six  infants were separated into two groups: infants 3\u20136 months of age who received a CRO (n = 28) were compared to infants > 6 months of age who received a CRO (n = 28) -Infants in the younger group had a significantly shorter length of treatment -. Problem Goal Intervention Expected Progression Home Program  Abnormal cranial shape _ _ Facial asymmetriesImprove cranial symmetry _ _ Improve facial symmetryEducation of parents Physical therapy is the preferred mode, positioning also effective(3) _ Positioning _ Parental instruction on the importance of altering the child\u2019s position to reduce the amount of time and pressure on the flattened area. Suggested positions include prone, side- lying, semi-side- lying, and supported sitting depending on the infant\u2019s cranial asymmetry. Having the child spend time, while in supine, with the head positioned so that the pressure is shifted to the nonflattened area of the cranium may initiate natural remodeling _ Prescription, application of devices and equipment _ Referral to a pediatric neurologist and/or pediatric orthotist for consult regarding need for a CRO _ _ Integumentary repair and protection techniques _ If a CRO is being used, a wearing schedule must be established by prescribing orthotist. Child\u2019s tolerance of orthosis must be monitored closely _ _N/A Provide the caregivers with written instruction on proper positioning and education on the benefits of a CRO and its use, and confirm understanding of prescribed wearing schedule  Decreased cervical ROM _ _ Feeding difficultiesNormal cervical ROM _ _ Ability to feed without difficultyManual therapy _ Stretching is indicated when cervical ROM is limited and/or torticollis is present. Stretching should be of low intensity and not elicit any pain in the child _ _ According to the AAP, perform 3 repetitions per neck exercise with each diaper change. These exercises should take ~2 minutes per diaper change. Hold each stretch to end range for 10\u201320 s. However, if the infant is irritable or fussy, recommend that the parent select a time to perform stretches when the infant is more relaxed and compliant _ _ Therapeutic exercise _ Instruct the parent in proper handling and positioning techniques to facilitate the child to actively turn his/her head in the preferred direction and/or maintain cervical midline orientation. Such techniques include caregiver carrying the baby over the desired shoulder and/or hip, using the \u201cfootball\u201d hold to limit head tilting to the undesirable side, counter-positioning on changing table and crib to facilitate cervical rotation to the desired side _ _ Prone positioning to facilitate cervical extension strength and ROM, trunk extension strength and ROM, and shoulder strength _ _ _ Passive, active, and active assisted cervical ROM with the use of play (toys, rattles, visual/auditory stimuli) may be effective in increasing overall cervical ROMParent should be able to bottle-feed child in either of caregiver\u2019s arms and/or from either breast with relative ease. Infant should be able to rotate his/her head fully to both sides as well as maintain cervical midline orientation with ease _ _ Child should be able to maintain his/her head in midline; no head tilt present on a consistent basisProvide the caregiver with written instructions and pictures for the infant\u2019s customized home program. May instruct the caregiver to take photos or videos with camera/smart phone to enhance parent compliance _ _ Caregiver education regarding the importance of daily ROM and the need for proper technique. Caregiver should be able to comply with positioning program in order to facilitate reshaping of the head and improve ROM. Ask caregiver to demonstrate techniques to allow time for feedback and questions  Decreased strength _ _ Developmental delayImprove strength _ _ Attainment of motor milestonesTherapeutic exercise _ In this age group, strengthening and the acquisition of new motor skills are largely accomplished through play. The clinician should engage the child in play in order to gain active participation _ _ Head-righting exercises to stimulate lateral neck flexion through positional carrying and/ or rolling activities _ _ Functional training _ Prone: Facilitate cervical rotation and extension through use of visual and auditory stimuli. If child has a preference for one side, encourage prolonged rotation to opposite side; often parent\u2019s face and mirrors are the best motivators. The prone position can also help facilitate cranial reshaping since there are posterior forces acting on the head while simultaneously strengthening the cervical and thoracic extensors and shoulder stabilizers _ _ Side-lying: Play in this position can help facilitate cervical midline orientation and apply pressure to the lateral aspect of the head that is excessively bossed. This also allows the child to bring hands to mouth or facilitate play with a desired toy. These two benefits may improve tolerance to position _ _ Supine: Encourage full cervical rotation in both directions through use of tracking toys or observation of parents\u2019 faces. If there is a muscle strength imbalance, focus on strengthening the one side more than the other _ _ Supported sit: Encourage full cervical rotation in both directions through use of toys or observation of parents. Also use this position to develop cervical lateral flexion strength by tilting the infant from side to side. If there is a muscle strength imbalance, focus on strengthening the one side more than the otherProgress child as indicated by response to treatment and developmental readiness. By 4 months of age, the infant should be able to maintain the prone position for at least 10 minutes, without distress. The infant should be spending a total of 30\u201360 minutes a day playing in prone _ _ Child should be able to maintain cervical midline when positioned in prone, supine, or supported sit. Child should not rest with a head tilt, due to an imbalance in cervical muscle strengthProvide patient and family/ caregivers with written instructions and illustrations regarding functional activities that can be performed at home. Reinforce the importance of midline positioning when the child is in supported sitting devices such as an infant carrier, bouncy seat, or swing _ _ Ask caregiver to demonstrate proper handling and positioning techniques.
