            "Open-heart  surgery is defined as any surgical procedure that requires the thoracic cavity to be cut open and surgery is performed on the heart muscle, valves, arteries, or other parts of the heart. Procedures typically involve the use of a cardiopulmonary bypass machine (\u201cheart lung machine\u201d) to maintain circulation while the heart is not beating",
            "Cardiac rehabilitation is a medically supervised program designed to optimize the physical, psychological, and social functioning of patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) as well as to stabilize, slow, or reverse the progression of the underlying disease processes, reducing mortality and disability \u2013Cardiac rehabilitation programs are important in order to maximize the patient\u2019s functional outcomes to allow them to return to work, their social roles, and/or their recreational activities. Cardiac rehabilitation starts in the hospital, with a focus on early mobilization, dietary instructions, and medication management(1) -Patients may continue their rehabilitation program in a short-stay  acute care setting if they are considered stable, but are unable to perform their basic household tasks at home. In this setting, patients are recommended a self-directed  walking program -Physical training exercises are given at the end of a patient\u2019s convalescence. Patient undergoes functional exercise testing, then is prescribed training exercises. Exercise prescription should indicate the type of exercises, intensity levels, frequency, and duration of exercises -Aerobic exercise sessions should begin with a warm-up phase of 2\u20135 minutes at low intensity. Patients may begin a strength training or circuit training program with resistance exercises if theyhave good left ventricular function"

            "The American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association cardiac rehabilitation guidelines are as follows:(6) \u2013Education and supervised exercise programs should begin 4 to 8 weeks post-CABG  surgery and should be conducted 3 times a week for 3 months  \u2013Exercise training is an important adjunct to dietary modifications",
            "Exercise guidelines \u2013General recommendations are that adults perform 30 minutes of moderate-intensity  (3-6 METs) activity 5 days/week or 20 minutes of vigorous activity (> 6 METs) 3 days/week or a combination of moderate and vigorous activity(4) -The 30 minutes of moderate-intensity  activity can be continuous or accumulated in smaller bouts of at least 10 minutes each(4) -For older adults (> age 65) or adults ages 50 to 65 with chronic health conditions, the criteria for moderate and vigorous intensity are adjusted to a 10-point  scale, rather than MET level. Zero is sitting and 10 is working as hard as one can. Moderate intensity would be 5\u20136 and vigorous would be 7\u20138(4) \u2013General principles for cardiac rehabilitation programs(4) -Inpatient phase -Occurs in the hospital after the cardiovascular status is stable; generally lasts 3\u20135 days -Includes risk education, self-care  activities, and progress from sitting to standing to minimize deconditioning (days 1\u20133) -Orthostatic challenge to the cardiovascular system is usually introduced on days 3\u20135, by means of supervised ambulation monitored with ECG -Preparation for discharge may include stair climbing and other skills needed for life at home -Outpatient phase -Typically initiated after healing has occurred and a symptom-limited  stress test has been performed -The exercise is predominantly aerobic -The initial intensity of activity may be as low as 40\u201360%  of the maximum HR or 40\u201370%  of the functional capacity defined in METs -Duration may start at 10\u201315  minutes and progress to 30\u201360  minutes as patient\u2019s status improves -Each session should include warm-up  and cool-down  periods -Mode of exercise is usually continuous, using large muscle groups, such as stationary bike or walking -Circuit \u2013 interval exercise may be used -Advantages include that patients may perform more physical work, exercise at a lower rate of perceived exertion, and exercise at a higher intensity so that fitness improves faster -Weight training may be initiated -Resistive exercise should not produce ischemic symptoms associated with an increase in HR or BP -Progression of the workload should occur when there have been three consecutive sessions during which the peak HR is below the target HR -Independent phase -Recreational activities to maintain the levels gained during supervised training should be introduced -Examples include swimming, hiking, jogging (5 miles per hour), cycling (12 miles per hour), vigorous downhill skiing \u2013Encouraging early enrollment in cardiac rehabilitation appears to be safe if careful, individualized assessments and exercise protocols are developed within an established cardiac rehabilitation program(10) -Based on a review of clinical adverse effects within 6 months of discharge of 250 patients who underwent either CABG surgery or heart valve surgery or had an MI (served as control)",
