            "Whiplash is the mechanism (i.e., acceleration-deceleration)  of neck injury that usually results from a vehicle-related  crash. Whiplash-associated  disorder (WAD) is a bony or soft-tissue  whiplash injury characterized by a variety of clinical manifestations. In chronic whiplash (CW) cases, the symptoms have persisted longer than 3 months(1)",
            "The Quebec task force created a classification system of the whiplash injury:(36) -Grade 0: No pain or physical symptoms -Grade 1: Neck pain, stiffness, or tenderness but no physical symptoms -Grade 2: Neck pain and musculoskeletal symptoms (e.g., decreased ROM, point tenderness) -Grade 3: Neck pain and associated neurological symptoms (e.g., sensory deficits, decreased deep tendon reflexes, muscle weakness) -Grade 4: Neck pain with fracture/dislocation",
            "Soft-tissue  neck pain with increased sensitivity to both painful and innocuous stimuli is characteristic of CW. This hypersensitivity also commonly involves the upper trapezius and other shoulder muscles(1,2)",
            "Moderately strong evidence supports neck-specific  therapeutic exercise for pain management and functional rehabilitation to reduce disability in patients with CW symptoms(1,2)",
            "Complications associated with CW pain include stress reactions (e.g., dizziness, tinnitus, vision changes, poor concentration or memory, occipital headaches, sleep disturbances, anxiety, depression, hypochondriasis) of uncertain etiology.(36)Treatments for such persistent neuropsychological whiplash symptoms are not covered in this Clinical Review"

            "Therapeutic exercise \u2013Authors of a 2014 systematic review of 10 RCTs suggest that supervised programs that combine neck strengthening and flexibility exercises are effective for the management of chronic neck pain(22) \u2013In a study, subjects with WAD did not respond differently from subjects with mechanical neck pain to manual therapy and exercise in the short term(30)  -Twenty-two  subjects with mechanical neck pain and 28 with WAD participated in a study in Italy. Each received 6 sessions of specific neck exercises and manual therapy. Both groups had similar improvements in cervical ROM \u2013A large multicenter RCT in Sweden recruited 216 patients with chronic WAD between February2011 and May 2012. This RCT evaluated the effect of three different treatment strategies(2,29,41,44,45) -Main inclusion criteria: Chronic WAD, WAD score of 2 or 3, NDI score of at least 10/50, and a V AS greater than 20/100 for the preceding week. Some studies added inclusion criteria and evaluated that data set separately -Treatment groups (12-week  intervention period) -PT-led  neck-specific  exercise group (NSE):Patients met 2 times per week with the PT to perform neck exercises that began with unresisted isometric cervical flexion, extension, and rotation. These exercises were progressed to low isometric resistance and then to neck-specific  gym exercises. Patients received postural instruction and home exercise programs with resistance bands -PT-led  neck-specific  exercise group with abehavior approach (NSEB): Patients received the same treatment as the NSE group with the addition of pain management education and behavioral activities (e.g., goal setting) -Prescription of physical activity (PPA): Patientsreceived instruction to perform general physical activity of their choice outside the healthcare system. Specific neck exercises were not given. They received one call from a PT for encouragement to continue staying active -Primary study outcomes were published in 2015 and evaluated self-rated  pain (V AS), disability (NDI), and self-efficacy (Self-efficacy  scale). Results favored the NSE and NSEB groups over the PPA group(2) -At 3 months, most patients who had at least a 50% reduction in pain were in one of the two NSE groups (29%\u201348%) compared with the PPA group (5%). At 6 months most patients whocontinued to have at least a 50% reduction in pain were in one of the two NSE groups (39%\u201344%)  compared with the PPA group (28%) -NDI improved more in both the NSE and NSEB groups compared to the PPA group at 3 and 6 months -Self-efficacy  scores improved only in the NSE group -These results showed that neck-specific exercises can improve pain, disability, and self-efficacy.  The benefits of the addition of a behavioral component were inconclusive -In 2016,1-year  and 2-year  follow-up  of randomized subjects continued to favor the NSE and NSEB groups over the PPA group(29) -At 1year, most patients whohad at least a 50% reduction in pain were in one of the two NSE groups (61%) compared with the PPA group (26%). At 2years the difference was not significant -NDI scores improved more in the two NSE groups compared to the PPA group at 1 and 2-years.  The PPA group did not improve over time -Self-efficacy  scores did not show any significant differences between groups at 1- or 2-year  follow-up -In 2018, a secondary analysis of the primary study investigatedthe effect of the three treatments on work ability (measured by the Work Ability Index). Results were in favor of the NSE and NSEB groups over the PPAgroup(41) -Additional inclusion criteriawere those currently employed or employed at the time of the accident (N = 165 of the original 216) -Measures were taken at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months -Work ability improved significantly more in the NSEB group compared to the PPA group at 3-, 6-,and 12-month  time periods. The NSEB group was significantly better than only the NSE group at 12months -Work ability decreasedover time in the PPA group -In 2019, a secondary analysis evaluated the effect of the three treatments on health-related  quality of life (HRQoL). NSE and NSEB groups continued to show favorable results over the PPA group(45) -No additional criteria were needed and all data on the 216 patients was evaluated -Outcome measures included the EQ-5D3L (including the EQ-V AS)  and the SF-36v2 -The NSE and NSEB groups had better outcomes than the PPA on the EQ-V AS  and the SF-36  physical component but did not have a higher overall EQ-5D score -The authors noted the complexity of HRQoL, and other factors may need to be considered -In 2019, a secondary analysis evaluatedthe three treatment groups forheadache severity and frequency. NSE and NSEB showed favorable results over the PPA in this study as well(44) -Additional inclusion criteria were patients who reported a headache in the preceding week or headache at least from time to time (N = 188 out of the original 216)  -Outcome measures were pain measured by V AS of current headache, maximum headache in the preceding week, and headachein the preceding 24\u200ahours -The NSE and NSEB groups had decreased headache both over time and compared to the PPA group. At 12 months 51% of the NSE group and 61% of the NSEB group reported at least a 50% reduction in their headache. The PPA group did not improve over time",
