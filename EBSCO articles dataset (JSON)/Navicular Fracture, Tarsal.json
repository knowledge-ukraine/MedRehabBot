            "Navicular stress fracture (NSF) is an uncommon fracture of the foot. It occurs most often in running and jumping sports(1)",
            "NSF is often missed in the acute stage due to vague clinical presentation as symptoms correlate poorly with early radiographic findings. The delay in diagnosis often results in treatment that is initiated an average of 4\u20137 months after onset of symptoms(2,3)",
            "The severity of NSF ranges from nondisplaced stress reaction (subchondral injury) to displaced, complete fracture(4)",
            "Nondisplaced NSFs usually heal well with conservative treatment.(3,4) However, conservative management requires strict non-weightbearing  (NWB) for a minimum of 6 weeks(5)",
            "Surgical management is indicated for complex NSFs (i.e., displaced, unhealed due to nonunion/malunion, or recurrent)(2)",
            "The three classifications of NSF, according to Saxena and colleagues(24) \u2013Type 1: fracture involves dorsal cortex only \u2013Type 2: fracture extends from dorsum to the navicular body \u2013Type 3: complete bicortical disruption or application of equipment  .

            "The location of the navicular bone during running predisposes it to stress and impingement between the head of the talusand the cuneiforms.(21) The stresses tend to be concentrated in the least vascular area of the bone (central one third)(21)",
            "Vascular insufficiency in the central one third of the tarsal navicular may be a potential causative factor in NSF. Authors ofa cadaveric study of 54 adult feet found that 6 (11.1%) navicular bones had an avascular zone that extended to the dorsalcortex(10)",
            "NSF can begin as a partial (incomplete) break, often in the mid-body  of the navicular(3,6)",
            "In the acute stage, radiographs typically are negative for osseous abnormalities, whereas a technetium-99  (Tc-99)  bonescan may show pathological changes and enable early management to avoid Lisfranc fracture.

At 7-year  follow-up,  6 athletes remained symptom-free(20) Delay in diagnosis can cause long-term  pain and functional loss(21,22) Stress fractures that are untreated can result in displacement, avascular necrosis, malunion and nonunion(23)",
