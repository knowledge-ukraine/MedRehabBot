            "Nintendo Wii Fit (NWF) is a video gaming system that promotes multiple modes of exercise in virtual reality. NWF comes with exercise gaming applications (\u201cexergames\u201d) that challenge static and dynamic balance. The user stands on a balance board/force plate while interacting with a selected exergame and is given visual and auditory feedback(18)",
            "NWF, a type of virtual reality exercise system, can provide sensory feedback (auditory, visual, and proprioceptive sensations) to the individual participating in the exercise training program. The training program\u2019s level of difficulty can be adjusted as the user improves(19)",
            "Interactive video gaming with NWF has potential for promoting therapeutic physical activity in children and adolescents with disabilities(1,2,3)",
            "NWF and other gaming systems are relatively inexpensive and can provide greater patient compliance with the individual\u2019s home exercise program due to increased interest and motivation in the prescribed activities",
            "This Clinical Review describes the use and feasibility of NWF as an adjunct therapeutic intervention for children and adolescents with selected diagnoses",

NWF group played the Nintendo Wii Fit game for 20 minutes/day for 12 weeks and was allowed to play any of the 20 games included, while control group did not participate with any activities -Results indicate that those in the NWF group demonstrated significant improvements in manual dexterity, aiming & catching, balance, and higher scores in the Movement Assessment Battery for Children-2  (mABC-2) \u2013Authors of an RCT found that NWF can improve static balance and lower extremity strength in patients with intellectual disabilities -Based on a 2016 study from Taiwan involving 24 students with intellectual disabilities. Participants were randomized into the NWF group (N = 8), physical education (N = 8), and sedentary activity groups (N = 8). The NWF group participated in two, 40-minute  Wii Fit balance games (study did not report specific games used) per week for 8 weeks. PE group underwent general physical education activities that included jumping rope and jogging, and the sedentary activity group only performed sedentary activities for 8 weeks -Balance was assessed using the TUG, and single limb stance with eyes closed. Strength was assessed using the speed strength index during rapid standing -NWF group and PE group showed improvements in pre-and post-  measurements of single limb stance with eyes closed, however the NWF group showed significant improvements (p < 0.05). There were only slight improvements in strengthamong the NWF group and PE group, but were not significant",
            "NWF exergaming can improve physical, mental, and social functioning in youth with acquired brain injury(15) \u2013Based on pilot study in the United States of 45 participants (mean age 17.1 years who completed 12 weeks of individually tailored NWF \u2013Significant improvements were found in the amount of general physical activity, speed of information processing, attention, response inhibition, and visual-motor coordination \u2013This study lacked a control group",
            "Weight loss \u2013Exergames on the NWF such as Obstacle Course, Hula Hoop, and Free Run are an effective tool to provide acute cardiovascular responses that mimic light exercise, but might not provide moderate levels of intensity(22) \u2013The American College of Sports Medicine 2010 published Guidelines for Exercise Testing and Prescription state the following:(8) -The energy cost of NWF exergaming and other interactive video games is roughly equivalent to moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (e.g., brisk [3 mph] walking)(8) -Exergaming has potential for weight management when following guidelines for the duration and frequency of typical fitness activities(8) -For example, an ongoing exergaming program of 30 minutes per training session at least 3 times per week is recommended for weight loss(8) \u2013Based on a randomized controlled trial in Auckland, New Zealand, active video gaming at home for 24 weeks was associated with small, but definite, reductions in BMI and percentage body fat (% fat) in overweight children(4) -One hundred and sixty boys and girls (aged 10 to 14 years) played exergames for roughly 60 minutes at home on most days -BMI decreased from 25.6 kg/m2 to 24.8 kg/m2 -Percentage of fat decreased from 32.1% to 29.8%  -No significant changes were found in the control group (n = 162) \u2013Compared with traditional, nonactive video games, exergames elicit greater energy expenditure, which was similar in intensity to mild to moderate intensity physical activity. Exergames have the potential to increase free-living physical activity and improve body composition in children -Based on a systematic review of the literature published through December 2008 -Eleven studies focused on the quantification of the energy cost associated with playing active video games -Eight studies focused on the utility of active video games as an intervention to increase physical activity in children -Methodological limitations prevent definitive conclusions \u2013Based on a systematic review and meta-analysis  of the literature examining the efficacy of exergames on increased physical activity and energy expenditure in youth -Nine studies were identified -No games elicited an average energy expenditure above the 6 MET threshold for vigorous activity -A VGs are capable of generating EE in youth to attain PA guidelines -Few studies have assessed sustainability of A VG play, which appears to diminish after a short period of time for most players -Future research with better methodology needs to be conducted in order to fully assess the benefits of exergames on the impact of increasing childhood physical activity levels",
            "NWF can be used as an adjunct to traditional therapy for children with DCD; however, at this time, neuromotor task training (NTT) appears to provide greater benefits to these children(20) \u2013Based on a comparison study conducted in South Africa \u2013Fifty-six  children between the ages of 6 and 10 years who scored at or below the 16th percentile on the MABC-2  were placed in either the NTT or NWF group \u2013Mean motor performance scores of both groups improved; however, there were significant differences between groups, with the NTT group showing greater improvement in motor performance, functional strength, and cardiorespiratory fitness as measured by the MABC-2,  Functional Strength Test, and 20m shuttle run, respectively \u2013NWF group had significant improvement in anaerobic performance as measured by the Muscle Power Sprint Test \u2013Isometric strength measured with hand-held  dynamometry did not improve in either group \u2013Researchers concluded that NTT and NWF training programs can be used as part of therapy for children with DCD; however, NTT should be considered first",
