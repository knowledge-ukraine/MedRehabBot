            "Joubert syndrome (JS) is a rare congenital neurological disorder characterized by abnormalities of the cerebellum.(1) JS is one of a group of genetic conditions and syndromes that share a similar cerebellar malformation, and these are referred to as JS and related disorders (JSRDs).(1) The collection of cerebellar abnormalities associated with JSRDs is referred to as the molar tooth sign (MTS) when it is seen on an MRI scan and is the main diagnostic criterion for JS/JSRD.(1,2) Individuals with JS or a related disorder have some of the same characteristics; however, there is a spectrum of symptoms and a range of abilities in affected individuals",
