The fracture in the bone is bridgedwith a clot that becomes a hematoma; vasodilation, plasma exudation, and migration of inflammatory cells occur; deadbone is reabsorbed by osteoclasts; fibroblasts begin forming a new matrix(4)\u2013Reparative phase: Day 4 post injury to 4\u20136 weeks. This phase, also called ossification, begins as initial phase activitiesdecline. Fibrin in the hematoma provides a framework for fibroblast cell migration; capillary growth; soft callus formsfollowed by hard callus; clinical healing is achieved(4)\u2013Remodeling phase: Months to years following fracture. Lamellar bone forms over fracture; osteoclasts bridge fractureline, followed by osteoblasts; new capillaries form; new Haversian systems develop(4)",
            "Scaphoid fractures that are not treated appropriately can result in nonunion and progress to carpal instability. This can causeincongruity between the carpal bones and result in painful synovitis, arthritis, and carpal collapse within a few years(20)\u2013Three-dimensional  analysis and biomechanical studies of scaphoid nonunions suggest that the degree, progression, andsymptoms of carpal instability depend on the location of the fracture line"
