TLSOs are utilized to treat curves with an apex \u2264 T9. LSOs are utilized to treat lumbar curves(6) The Osaka Medical College (OMC) Brace is a popular TLSO brace used in Japan that was developed in the 1970s. In a 2015 study, researchers found the OMC brace to be effective at changing curve progression if high compliance is maintained(15)The goal of bracing is to prevent curve progressionBrace wearing can be terminated when the child has reached skeletal maturity(1) Researchers in a 2014 study found that high compliance with wearing a brace can alter curve progression and decrease chance of surgery, while overnightonly  bracing and poor compliance are associated with a high rate of curve progression(13) A newer technique of ultrasound-assisted  brace casting has been found to be a radiation-free  way to check pressure level, location, and brace corrections(14) Surgery Surgery can help increase lung volume and overall long-term  prognosis in patients who have decreased preoperative lung volumes(19) Authors of a retrospective study in 2018 found that a surgical procedure of using a surgical procedure of anterior release, instrumentation, and fusion using an autogenous rib graftshow good outcomes for healthrelated  quality of life (HRQoL), pain scores, and functional activities (23)",

            "Structural scoliosis \u2013Bracing -Spinal bracing is generally not utilized in this patient population as it is found to be ineffective and poorly tolerated (29) -Bracing is controversial. The authors of some reports advocate for early bracing to prevent surgery, while other authors report that bracing is not an effective means to prevent surgery. In addition, there is controversy over which type of brace is most effective -A study conducted in Hong Kong showed that bracing affected quality of life negatively(7) -Providing psychosocial support to patients and their families was found to be important to enhance their quality of life as well as their compliance -Good compliance with a conservative treatment program that included bracing and specific exercises was reported to result in significant improvement in curvatures in a study conducted in South Africa(8) -Poor compliance resulted in progression of curvatures and was associated with poor quality of life -Factors affecting compliance need to be identified and may relate to psychosocial coping mechanisms \u2013Therapeutic exercise -Researchers conducting an RCT (N = 47) in Turkey found three-dimensional  Schroth exercises performed in clinic to be superior to a home exercise program at decreasing both Cobb and rotation angles in patients with AIS(20) -Schroth method uses exercises to strengthen and/or lengthen asymmetrical muscles. Exercises consist of posture correction and corrective breathing patterns -Subjects were divided into three groups: Schroth exercise group, home exercise group, and a control group -Subjects in the Schroth exercise group performed exercises 1.5 hours a day 3 times a week. Exercises included spinal elongation, de-rotation,  de-flexion,  stretching, strengthening, and rotational breathing exercises. After 6 weeks the exercises were performed at home -Subjects in the home exercise group received instruction from a physical therapist and were asked to do their exercises at home -The control group received no formal instruction -In a 2014 European study, researchers found that active self-correction,  task-oriented  exercises, and patient education performed until skeletal maturity is reached decreased incidence of spinal deformity and improved quality of life in patients with AIS(16) -Scientific Exercises Approach to Scoliosis (SEAS) consists of exercises that are adapted to each individual patient based on impairments present. These exercises include spinal stabilization, strengthening of anti-gravity  muscles, and balance and coordination activities while maintaining active self-correction  (ASC) (31) -ASC is the basis of SEAS. It may be possible to actively reduce the curve by teaching the patient specific exercises -It is thought that ASC activates a motor neuron reflex corrective response. The patient is taught to autocorrect postures without any external aid",
