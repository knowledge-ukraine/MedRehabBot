        "description": [
            "Considered a form of complementary and alternative medicine, the FM is a movement-education  technique designed to promote physical function and well-being. Developed by Moshe Feldenkrais, a physicist, engineer, and judo practitioner, in response to a knee injury for which surgery was suggested, the core principle is to first improve one\u2019s kinesthetic and proprioceptive self-awareness via guided practice and ultimately to transform unhealthy habits, movements, and postures into movements that are comfortable and easy(1)",
            "The underlying theory is that poor habitual movement patterns result in injury and pain and that multiple repetitions that concern the entire body lay down new neuromuscular patterns(2)",
            "FM is an experiential process or set of processes in which the client or group(3) \u2013is guided through a series of movement and sensation-based explorations \u2013practices sensing the differences between two or more options to achieve a task \u2013discerns and judges which option is more positive (easier, pleasurable, less effort) \u2013is encouraged to find further distinctions and improvements to apply in the learning framework",
            "It is a process in which the client(4) \u2013creates an environment that is comfortable, safe, and conducive to creating the movement \u2013greatly reduces the amount of effort required for that movement by making fine discriminations about the effects of force acting on the system from inside and/or outside \u2013has as a goal to develop a rich understanding of changes throughout the system produced by small perturbations(4)",
            "Two delivery methods are offered to the public \u2013 Awareness Through Movement (ATM) and Functional Integration (FI). They differ in practice but are similar in principle and process \u2013ATM -Group, verbally directed classes(3) -Participants are encouraged to move at their own pace and to experiment(1,5) -Client introduces the experimental forces into his or her own system with the intention of understanding how the body as a whole responds(4) -At no time are the students told how to do a movement; instead, they are allowed to discover how to embody the movement(6)  -Nearly all lessons (around 100 total) involve attention, perception, imagination, and cognition(6) \u2013FI -A hands-on  approach to facilitate movement and awareness(5) -Instructor provides more active assistance with the discovery process by gently and precisely moving the student(1) -The instructor provides the force inputs and the client attends to the changes caused by the perturbations(4) -Much of the learning takes place at the neurological level as the nervous system receives sensory information(6) -There is no strict expectation by the practitioner about what specific movement might emerge(4) -Sessions often take place on firm Feldenkrais table or on floor(6) -This method may include some soft-tissues  work to relieve excessive muscle tension, spasm, or muscle tightness(7) \u2013In practice and if possible, it is common to move back and forth between ATM and FI(4)",
            "The FM places emphasis on relaxation of muscles on stretch and distracting and compressing joints for sensory awareness, which reflect combined proprioceptive techniques to enhance body schema awareness(8) \u2013Taking muscles off stretch slows afferent firing, which decreases overload of the CNS \u2013Compression and distraction of joints enhances specific input from a body part and combines it with facilitating input of lesser intensity from other body segments",
            "ATM can be considered a form of relaxation training as it combines sensory awareness, movements of the limbs and trunk, deep breathing, conscious relaxation procedures, and self-massage  to alter muscle imbalances and abnormal posture in the interest of remediating muscle tension and pain(9)"

Inter-coder  reliability was reported as good \u2013Content analysis revealed the following motor skill acquisition elements and postural control skills: -Motor skill acquisition elements \u2013 internal feedback, repetition, variability of practice using exploratory learning approach -Postural control skills \u2013 intersegmental coordination of ankle/hip/trunk synergies, control of center of mass over base of support \u2013Key findings: -Extensive involvement of trunk flexibility and control in balance activities -Intensive attention to internal feedback which was linked to body awareness training",
            "Applications for older adults \u2013Feldenkrais exercises result in positive changes in balance, mobility, fear of falls, and balance confidence(14) -Based on a stratified RCT conducted in the United States with 47 older adults (mean age 75.6) assigned to either intervention or control group -Intervention was 3 one-hour  Feldenkrais sessions a week for 5 weeks using the ATM technique that were taught by a certified Feldenkrais teacher. The focus of the exercises was improving balance and mobility. The control group was a wait-list  control -Outcome measures were tandem stance for balance, TUG and TUGc (TUG with added cognitive task) for mobility, GAITRite Walkway system for gait parameters, ABC for balance confidence, and Falls Efficacy Scale for fear of falling -Balance and mobility significantly increased while fear of falling decreased in intervention group. Balance confidence and mobility showed significant improvements while performing a cognitive task -Authors suggested further studies with more total treatments to evaluate effectiveness of Feldenkrais exercises long-term.  Studies comparing FM to other interventions that improve balance and prevent falls would be valuable \u2013Both Pilates and the FM are effective in improving balance and decreasing propensity to fall in ambulatory older adults although Pilates was found to be superior in improving quality of life (QoL)(15) -Based on an RCT conducted in India with 60 ambulatory older adults living in nursing homes who were assigned to either Pilates intervention (PI), FM intervention, or control group -Intervention was thrice weekly for 6 weeks: PI was 45\u201360  minutes of exercises, FM was ATM method with 5 lessons (10 repetitions with 2-minute  rest between exercises), and control group walked for a total of 22 minutes -Outcome measures were Functional Reach Test (FRT), TUG, DGI, and RAND-36  Measure of Health-Related Quality of Life, measured at baseline and after 6 weeks of training -PI and FM groups were significantly better than controls in all outcome measures; however, PI was found to be more clinically effective when compared to FM in all outcome scores \u2013In a similar non-randomized  study from Australia, researchers suggested that a FM balance class may improve mobility and balance in older adults(16) -Twenty-six  community-dwelling  older adults who had signed up for FM balance classes (again using the program \u201cGetting Grounded Gracefully\u201d for a total of 20 treatments) as part of a falls-prevention  program were compared to 37 controls who volunteered in response to an advertisement for participants in a balance study  -Baseline measures were similar except that control group had significantly more confidence in their balance as measured by ABC questionnaire -Main outcome measures were ABC questionnaire, Four Square Step Test, and self-selected  gait speed (using GAITRite instrumented gait mat). Compared to control group, FM group made significant improvement in all outcome measures \u2013A series of FM classes, twice a week for 30 weeks, taken by 15 patients with osteoarthritis (average age 67) improved performance on the Four Square Step Test and on some gait parameters (anterior pelvic tilt reduction, increased knee extension at heel contact, and knee flexion at swing). Participants also reported greater ease of movement in this Australian study(17)",
            "Applications for pain disorders \u2013The FM was an effective intervention for 61 patients with chronic neck/scapular pain and visual impairment according to an RCT conducted in Sweden(18) -Patients with visual impairment were chosen because of the hands-on  communication inthe FM which could benefit this population -Intervention was one 2-hour  session a week for 12 weeks held by an experienced licensed FM PT. FM was applied in both forms (ATM and FI) with the aim of increasing awareness of sensory afferents, exploring habitual but unconscious muscular patterns, breaking stereotyped movement patterns, and enabling self-care  for pain -Outcome measures were the V AS (during standardized palpation of the left and right occipital, upper trapezius, and levator scapulae muscles), the self-assessed  degree of pain on the Visual, Musculoskeletal, and Balance Complaints questionnaire, and the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item  Short-Form  Health Survey (SF-36)  bodily pain scale -Patients undergoing FM reported significantly less pain than the controls according to the V AS and Visual, Musculoskeletal, and Balance Complaints questionnaire ratings at post-treatment  follow-up and 1-year  follow-up \u2013Authors of a 2011 systematic review examining the effectiveness of the FM in preventive and symptomatic treatment of LBP in adults concluded that available studies do not prove the effectiveness of the FM(19) -The authors could find only 2 articles that met inclusion criteria \u2013Researchers who conducted a 2017 RCT comparing FT and back school found no difference in outcomes for patients with nonspecific chronic LBP(24) -Based on a study of 53 patients in Italy with chronic LBP -Patients were randomly assigned to either a 3-month back school or a 3-month  FM program -Outcome measures were V AS, McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ), Waddell Disability Index, Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36),  and Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness Questionnaire (MAIA) -The researchers found no differences in outcomes at end of program or at 3-month  follow-up  and suggested that FM could be used as an alternative to back school \u2013Authors of two qualitative studies evaluated the FM in adults with chronic pain and found benefits other than pain relief -Improvements in movement ability and body awareness were themes described in the diaries and interviews conducted with 14 women with non-specific  neck and shoulder pain who attended 10 group sessions over 6\u20137 weeks in a study in Sweden(20) -The authors did note that participants found the exercises difficult to perform utilizing self-training  on a daily basis -Improved self-efficacy  through somatic education and awareness was the theme identified through semi-structured interviews with 11 adults with chronic-episodic  back pain who had been attending ATM lessons in the FM method in Australia(21) -The authors credited individuals\u2019 perception of having control of their back pain by awareness through movement as empowering",
            "Neurological disorders \u2013Findings from an RCT conducted in Brazil on the effects of FM-based  exercise on QoL and depression in older adults with Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) indicated that a program based on the FM can contribute to the QoL of patients with PD and decrease the rate of depression(22) -Thirty patients randomly assigned to intervention and control. Intervention group underwent 50 sessions (twice a week for 25 weeks) of a PT program based on FM with emphasis on chosen ways to breathe, roll, sit, stand, squat, and walk easily and efficiently -The control group received 1 week of educational lectures(fall prevention, medication use, managing ADLs) immediately after baseline assessment  -Both groups assessed at baseline and at conclusion of intervention. Outcome measures were the Parkinson\u2019s Disease Quality of Life (PDQL) questionnaire and the Beck Depression Inventory -Authors suggest that the success of the FM indicates the importance of interventions that work with awareness of movement for the promotion of wellness for patients with PD",
            "COPD \u2013The FM significantly improved functional capacity and lung function among patients with COPD in an 8-week  study conducted in Malaysia(23) -Based on an observational pilot study with 11 patients with COPD attending ATM classes. Activities included relaxation exercises, breathing exercises, floor exercises for trunk and pelvic movements, and upper limb movements -It was not clear from study how many treatments per week but descriptions of the lessons would imply one session per week of about one-hour duration -Outcome measures were 6MWT for functional capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1-s, predicted percent (FEV1 pred %) for lung function, and Health-Related Quality of Life questionnaire",
