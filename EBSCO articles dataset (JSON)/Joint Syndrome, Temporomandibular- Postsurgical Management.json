            "Temporomandibular disorder (TMD) is a term used to describe a number of underlying joint and muscle conditions affecting the temporomandibular joint (TMJ).(2) The TMJ is the synovial articulation between the mandible and the cranium. The articular surfaces are covered by fibrous tissue rather than hyaline cartilage and are divided into two joint spaces by an intra-articular  disc(1)",
            "The American Academy of Orofacial Pain categorizes TMD according to the anatomic origin of pain(2) \u2013Articular disorders of the joint include congenital, inflammatory (synovitis, arthritides, capsulitis), TMJ disk derangement, hyper or hypomobile TMJ, TMJ trauma (condylar fracture, dislocation) \u2013Muscle disorders involving the muscles of mastication include occlusomuscular dysfunction (bruxism), masticatory muscle spasm, myositis, myofibrosis, neoplasm, poorly fitting dentures",
            "Up to one half of the United States population has at least 1 sign or symptom of TMD, but most individuals are not limited by their symptoms and < 25% seek medical or dental treatment(2)",
            "With conservative therapy, 75% of patients report symptoms resolved within 3 months.(2) However, for those individuals whose signs and symptoms are not improving, surgical intervention should be considered",
            "Please see Clinical Review\u2026Temporomandibular Disorders, Topic ID number T708575for information about conservative treatment",
            "Indications for surgical intervention \u2013Immediate surgery is indicated in the cases of trauma and clear structural abnormalities. Surgery for TMD is reserved for those who have failed conservative treatment and continue with intolerable pain with limited function(8,9) \u2013There is no clear timeline identified in the literature as to when conservative treatment has \u201cfailed,\u201d and there are few long-term  randomized controlled studies to assist surgeons in choosing the best surgical procedure; thus, personal experience will often dictate the course of treatment  -Standards to identify persons who would most likely benefit from surgery have not been established. Failure to respond to conservative treatments, for example, does not automatically mean that surgery is necessary \u2013The following tables outline the common surgical procedures performed on the temporomandibular region, the indications for each procedure, potential complications, and therapy contraindications/precautions.
