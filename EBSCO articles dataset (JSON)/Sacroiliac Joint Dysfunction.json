            "The sacroiliac joint (SIJ) has hyaline cartilage lining the sacral side, fibrocartilage lining the iliac side, and a fibrous capsule encompassing the entire joint(1,2,26)",
            "The SIJ is generally C-shaped,  with two lever arms that interlock at the second sacral level, and contains many ridges and depressions, indicating its function for stability more than motion(26)",
            "A large network of ligaments surrounds the SIJ and provides the majority of its stability.(1,26) The deep anterior, posterior, and interosseous ligaments resist the load of the sacrum relative to the ilium; the more superficial ligaments (e.g., the sacrotuberous ligament, long and short sacroiliac ligaments) react to dynamic motions. The long dorsal ligament can become stretched in periods of reduced lumbar lordosis(26)",
            "The SIJ transmits vertical forces between the lower extremities and the spine.(2) SIJ dysfunction may involve a hypermobile or hypomobile condition (e.g., decreased or increased trunk lateral flexion) associated with nonspecific low back pain (LBP) and/or pelvic girdle pain",
            "The prevalence of SIJ dysfunction is estimated to vary between 5% and 30% among patients reporting LBP.(5) A differential diagnosis is usually conducted to rule out other more common causes of LBP before treating SIJ dysfunction, which is mainly a diagnosis of exclusion(5,6)",
            "Conservative treatment for pain linked to SIJ dysfunction includes non-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), modification of physical activities, physical therapy, and use of an SIJ belt in some cases"

The patient is asked to extend the affected hip while holding the contraction for 3-4 seconds, while the therapist provides manual resistance(43) \u2013However, authors of another RCT (N = 30) in India found that the MET group and the conventional physical therapy group had similar reductions in pain and ODI. The MET group also demonstrated a return to near normal for functional leg-length  difference(31) \u2013Authors of a case study in South Korea found that 11 sessions of posterior pelvic tilt Kinesio taping improved pelvic inclination and reduced medial buttock pain in an amateur swimmer with LBP related to SIJ dysfunction and increased sacral horizontal angle(33) \u2013Authors of a retrospective study (N = 677) in South Africa found that physiotherapists who had treated the patients for SIJ dysfunction were most likely to use stretches and mobility exercises in combination with joint mobilizations and soft tissue massage for treatment, although evidence was lacking to support the efficacy of any particular intervention(34) \u2013Evidence is lacking on the effectiveness of ultrasound, neuromuscular electrical stimulation, iontophoresis, TENS, and other electrotherapeutic modalities in SIJ dysfunction \u2013Authors of a randomized controlled trial in Korea concluded that gait training with shoe inserts significantly decreased pain in patients with sacroiliac dysfunction(41)",
