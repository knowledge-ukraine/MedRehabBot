            "Vision is the process whereby the brain identifies, interprets, and responds appropriately to visual data. It is how the appearance of an object (e.g., shape, color, location, and spatial organization) is perceived by an individual(3)",
            "Light rays enter the eye and are transformed into electrical signals in the retina; these signals are transmitted via the optic nerve to the cortex, where they are processed(3)",
            "Visual dysfunction can affect visual acuity, visual fields, color vision, night vision, and/ or ocular motility, as well as visual perception and visual motor integration, and can impact mobility and functional skills and abilities(3)",
            "Categories of visual dysfunction \u2013Low vision \u2013 bilateral vision loss that cannot be resolved with corrective lenses or medical/surgical intervention; includes decreased acuity, visual field loss, or both(2,3) -Visual dysfunction may be age-related  (e.g., cataracts, glaucoma, age-related  macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy),(3) but it can occur at any age -Changes in vision may occur following a neurological event (e.g., traumatic brain injury [TBI] or stroke)(3,34,48) \u2013Ocular motor dysfunction \u2013 the eye mobility functions that allow the eyes to move in a smooth and coordinated manner are impaired. Areas of ocular motor function that can be affected include: -alignment of the eyes (binocular vision) \u2013 if the eyes are not aligned, diplopia (i.e., double vision) may occur.(3) This is the simultaneous perception of two images of a single object, displaced horizontally, vertically, or diagonally in relation to each other -vergence \u2013 ability to focus the eyes on a single point by simultaneous movement of the pupils toward (convergence) or away from (divergence) one another to adjust for different distances between the eyes and the visual target -accommodation(3) \u2013 the ability to change the focus from distant to near or near to distant objects. Involves pupil constriction, vergence, and change in convexity of the lens -scanning(3) \u2013 the ability to see visual data in an organized manner, most commonly from left to right -saccades(3) \u2013 rapid eye movements from one point to another that affect tracking and reading. These high-speed  movements bring new objects into central vision, where images can be seen in more detail \u2013Unilateral visual neglect \u2013 a dysfunction in visual perception and attention to stimuli presented on one side of the body due to a brain lesion (e.g., stroke, tumor); failure to recognize or respond to stimuli on one side. The neglect is contralateral to the side of  the brain lesion and may be seen during activities, for example when a patient eats the food on only one side of his plate(3,48) -Unilateral neglect is more than just a visual condition, and may be referred to as hemispatial inattention. A patient with hemispatial inattention also may not respond to a voice when the person is on the affected side or a tactile stimulus on the affected side and may not be able to recall memories of objects or places that would normally be on that side \u2013Visual field deficits(5) \u2013 blind segments in one or more visual fields -Homonymous hemianopsia \u2013 blind areas in the right visual field of both eyes or left visual field of both eyes(5) -Homonymous quadrantanopia \u2013 blind areas in right or left visual field that affect superior or inferior quadrants of both eyes(5) -Bitemporal hemianopsia \u2013 loss of vision in temporal fields of both eyes(5) \u2013Visual perceptual dysfunction \u2013 impairment in the ability to integrate visual data taken in through the eyes with the sensory system for higher cognitive function(6)"
