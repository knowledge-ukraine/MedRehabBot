More research is needed to prove its effectiveness, but early evidence is promising(52) Medications approved by the U.S. FDA include rivastigmine, galantamine, donepezil, memantine, and memantine combined with donepezil. All except memantine work to increase the level of neurotransmitters in the brain and thereby improve cognition, but the effectiveness varies. Memantine blocks certain receptors in the brain from excess stimulation that can damage nerve cells(32) Antipsychotic drugs can be used to treat the symptoms of hallucinations, aggression, and agitation.
