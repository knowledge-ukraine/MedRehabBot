            "There is a normal degree of lordosis present in the cervical and lumbar spines. Normal curvatures of the spinal column exist to protect the spinal cord and to absorb shock during movement. They are the result of humans becoming bipedal(21)",
            "Lordosis is considered normal. However, the term lordosis can be confusing, as some use the term to indicate pathology, usually when there is hyperlordosis.(22) For clarification, when lordosis becomes atypical, the condition is known as: \u2013hyperlordosis \u2013 exaggerated curve \u2013hypolordosis \u2013 decreased curve",
            "In the lumbar spine there are many different ways to measure lordosis, depending on how many lumbar (or thoracic or sacral) vertebrae are included.Lordosis routinely is measuredradiographically.(22) One common way to measure lumbar lordosis is by the angle between the upper plane of L1 and the upper plane of S1.(23) Lumbar lordosis angles are the following: \u2013Hyperlordosis: > 70\u00b0 \u2013Normal lordosis: 31\u00b0\u201350\u00b0 \u2013Hypolordosis: 11\u00b0\u201330\u00b0 \u2013Lumbar kyphosis: < 10\u00b0",
            "The average cervical lordosis is 20\u02da if measured by the slope of C7 as in typical radiologic methods.(21) In the cervical spine, lordosis is also commonly defined by the angle between the posterior tangents of the vertebral bodies of C2 and C7, measurement of which is known as the Harrison posterior tangent method",
            "The amount of lordosis will vary in different conditions. Children tend to have less cervical lordosis and more lumbar lordosis compared to adolescents and adults.(22) Continuity of positional measurements should be considered with all baseline and follow-up measurements(12)"

            "Based on a study in Turkey, isometric neck extension exercise can improve cervical pain and lordosis(30) \u2013Based on a study of 65 patients with loss of cervical lordosis who were randomly assigned to either a control or intervention group. Both groups received NSAIDs for 10 days. The intervention group was also instructed in a home exercise program of isometric neck extension that they carried out for 3 months \u2013Outcome measures were cervical lordosis angle and neck pain severity at baseline and at 3 months",
            "Authors of a 2019 meta-analysis  concluded that exercise can have a positive effect on kyphosis angle but has no clear effect on lumbar lordotic angle. They also stated that both stretching and strengthening are important for normal lordosis(31) \u2013Ten RCTs were included, with 284 persons with either hypo-  or hyperlordosis and 255 controls. Seven studies examined the kyphosis angle and four studies assessed the lordotic angle ",
            "Based on a study in Korea, manipulation based on passive motion analysis is effective for decreasing forward head posture (FHP) and improving cervical lordosis and cervical ROM(16) \u2013Forty university students with impaired cervical posture and ROM were included in this study \u2013Subjects were randomly assigned to one of two manipulation/mobilization groups. The experimental group received a cervical joint manipulation based on passive motion analysis (MBPMA) and the control group received general mobilization \u2013Each group received treatment 3 times/week for 4 weeks, and effects were assessed via radiography \u2013MBPMA was an effective treatment for increasing cervical lordosis and cervical extension ROM, decreasing forward head posture, and improving cervical ranges of flexion and extension motion \u2013Mobilization (control group) was effective in increasing cervical extension ROM and decreasing forward head posture",
            "Authors of a preliminary study in Chile found that continuous use of a mandibular advancement appliance (MAA) in conjunction with a postural reeducation program significantly increased cervical lordosis, thereby improving cervical alignment in patients with temporomandibular disorders (TMD) and cervical pain with decreased lordosis (< 20\u00b0)(17) \u2013MAAs were made for each of the 22 patients. Patients were fitted and seen the first week followed by every 2 weeks for a total of 6 months \u2013A physical therapist evaluated and treated each patient beginning in the third month. Patients received postural reeducation programs to improve alignment of the head and neck and to restore muscular and joint mobility",
            "Pilates exercises improved performance, decreased lumbar lordosis, and decreased pain in patients with chronic non-specific  LBP(18) \u2013Twenty-seven  women with unexplained chronic LBP and hyperlordosis participated in this study in Iran \u2013Patients were randomly assigned to the experimental or control groups. Patients in the experimental group performed 8 weeks of Pilates exercises. The control group did not perform an exercise program \u2013Pre-test/post-test  measures focused on pain level, performance, and the degree of lumbar lordosis and included the Quebec, Oswestry, and Formetric 4D system \u2013The experimental group had a significant improvement in pain, functional mobility, and lumbar lordosis compared to the control group .
