Due to the complex mechanisms of PGP, it is vital for rehabilitation therapists to determine if the patient\u2019s pain is within their scope of practice or warrants referral back to the physician.(1) Most therapists should limit their treatment to address musculoskeletal causes of PGP; however, clinicians who specialize in women\u2019s health may wish to treat gynecological conditions that may be involved"

            "Therapeutic exercise \u2013Authors of a 2006 systematic review found that specific stabilization exercises produced modest positive improvements in patients with pelvic pain but are more effective than no treatment or education alone(18) -Strengthening exercises (examples of general strengthening and stabilization exercises that may be implemented once pain is effectively managed) -Latissimusdorsi (lat) strengthening: Lat rows and lat pull-downs  may be used using weight machines or cable machines to increase lat strength and core stability. Begin at a weight that is moderately challenging to the patient. Start with 3 sets of 10, progressing to 3 sets of 15\u201325  and increasing weight as tolerated -Gluteus maximus strengthening: Hip extension exercises using ankle weights, weight machines, or cable machines. Begin at a weight that is moderately challenging to the patient. Start with 3 sets of 10, progressing to 3 sets of 15\u201325  and increasing weight as tolerated. In patients who are beginning at a lower level of function, the use of AROM or light resistance bands and/or resistance tubing may be necessary -Hip adductors/abductors: Begin in side-lying  position with ankle cuff weights. (AROM may be necessary if patient is unable to tolerate resistance.) Progress to weight machines or cable machines. Start with 3 sets of 10, progressing to 3 sets of 15\u201325  and increasing weight as tolerated -Abdominal strengthening: Both the transverse and oblique abdominal muscles should be addressed. Consider implementing exercises for the rectus abdominis, although this may not be appropriate for every patient. Sit-ups, crunches (on mat, on yoga ball, straight and oblique, with medicine ball held across chest), and other appropriate abdominal strengthening may be used in progressively increasing difficulty to address abdominal weakness. If the patient is postpartum and has a diastasis rectus abdominis, crunches are contraindicated -PFM strengthening supervised by a trained specialist -Kegel exercises should not be performed if the PFM is shortened or in spasm -Kegel exercises may help increase the strength and activation of the PFM -These exercises are often performed incorrectly, so significant time should be spent in the education of the patient to facilitate appropriate performance. Vaginal palpation, biofeedback, and EMG can be used for patient training and to determine if appropriate contraction of the PFM is occurring -The patient should be instructed to draw up the pelvic floor as though trying to stop the flow of urine. Again, the use of palpation or biofeedback can help in teaching patients how to isolate their PFM -Vaginal cones/balls: Different sized/weighted cones or balls can be used to increase the strength and control of the PFM. Instruct the patient to use the appropriate size, which is the one that she has difficulty holding. The patient should try to hold the cone/ball for up to 20 minutes a day while performing activities such as sitting, standing, and walking. This may be performed one or more times per day, using caution not to fatigue the PFM \u2013Authors of a study (n = 47 women with chronic postpartum PGP) conducted in Norway who investigated the important elements to include in a treatment program for postpartum pelvic pain found that participants emphasized having a structured and systematic program in which they received guidance and support(19) -The women participated in a 20-month  physiotherapy treatment program -Treatment addressed SI joint restriction, posture, motor control exercises, breathing, and cognitive behavioral perspectives -Focus was on education and self-efficacy -Over 80% of women reported satisfaction with treatment and positive treatment effects \u2013Early pelvic floor muscle exercises after vaginal delivery may improve sexual function in postpartum women(20) -Authors of an RCT (N = 75 primiparous women) in Turkey used the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) as the outcome measure. This tool includes pain as one component -Improved PFM function and reduced pain were found at 7 months postpartum in the group assigned to early PFM exercises as compared to controls \u2013Authors of an RCT (N = 88 women with chronic postpartum PGP) in Sweden found that specific stabilizing exercises targeting trunk muscles did not appear to result in better outcomes than the clinically natural course(21) -The majority of women still experienced some pain almost 1 year after pregnancy regardless of whether or not they were treated with specific stabilizing exercises \u2013Authors of a 2013 systematic review found that the effectiveness of physical therapy for postpartum low back pain and/or PGP was unclear(31) -From an initial 105 articles retrieved, only 4 articles met the inclusion criteria -Although the 4 studies included exercises for motor control and lumbopelvic stability, different approaches were used, ranging from direct physical therapy care to videotapes for teaching patients how to perform the exercises -However, an individually guided progressive exercise program may provide greater improvement than protocols with less patient supervision \u2013A lumbopelvic belt with patient education may be more effective for treating PGP in pregnant women compared to exercise with patient education or patient education alone(32) -Authors of a cohort study in Iran assigned participants to one of 3 cohort groups: 1) lumbopelvic belt with patient education, 2) pelvic stabilizing exercises with patient education, and 3) patient education only -Outcome measurements used were V AS, the Oswestry Disability Index, and the Persian version of the WHO Quality of Life Questionnaire (WHOQOL-BREF) -Measurements were taken at baseline, at 3 weeks after initiation of treatment, and 6 weeks after initiation of treatment  -Patients who received a lumbopelvic belt along with patient education had better outcome measures when compared to the two other groups at 3 and 6 weeks. The exercise/patient education group had better outcome measures than the education only (control group) at the 6-week  mark \u2013Authors of a small RCT(N = 20 women with chronic low back pain) in Iran found that adding PFM exercises to routine treatment was not superior to routine treatment for low back pain(22) -Both the PFM exercise group and control group received routine treatment including electrotherapy (TENS, infrared, and ultrasound) and general exercises (back flexor and extensor exercises) -The experimental group also received supervised PFM exercises -Outcome measures of pain intensity (V AS), functional disability (Oswestry Disability Index), and PFM strength and endurance were not significantly different between the groups at 3 months follow-up -This study did not assess PGP",

Techniques included strumming and stroking massage of muscle fibers and application of pressure to tender points \u2013Authors of a small cohort study (N = 6 women with PFM tenderness and dyspareunia) found that transvaginal massage of PFM reduced chronic pelvic pain(24) \u2013Authors of a retrospective chart review (N = 1,106 women with chronic pelvic pain) in the United States found that transvaginal pelvic floor physical therapy was an effective treatment for chronic pelvic pain associated with myofascial pain(36) -Myofascial pain was diagnosed in 13.2% of screened patients -Fifty-one  percent of the patients with myofascial pain were referred for pelvic floor physical therapy -Pain scores significantly improved proportional to the number of physical therapy visits completed",
