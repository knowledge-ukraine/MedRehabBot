            "ASD is a developmental disorder characterized by impairments in development of language, communication, and reciprocal interaction and the presence of repetitive and ritualistic behaviors.(1) Onset is before the age of three years.(2,48) The diagnostic label of ASD now includes several conditions that were previously considered separate disorders: autistic disorder, pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS),  early infantile autism, atypical autism, Kanner\u2019s autism, high-functioning  autism, childhood disintegrative disorder, and Asperger\u2019s syndrome (AS).(48) According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5),  all of the aforementioned conditions are referred to and diagnosed as ASD.(48) Diagnostic criteria for ASD per the DSM-5  are as follows:",
            "Criterion A: Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts, as manifested by the following, currently or by history: \u2013Deficits in social-emotional  reciprocity (e.g., failure to initiate social interactions; inappropriate responses to social situations)(48) \u2013Deficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction (e.g., poor eye contact; lack of facial expression)(48) \u2013Deficits in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships (e.g., difficulty making friends; no interest in one\u2019s peers)(48) \u2013For the diagnosis of ASD, these deficits must be pervasive and sustained(48) \u2013In addition to documenting the presence of the above mentioned deficits, the diagnosing clinician (a specially trained developmental physician or psychologist) must also specify current severity level of social communication impairments when diagnosing ASD.(48) Because the severity of behaviors in ASD is known to fluctuate over time, the severity label is used to refer only to current severity(48)",
            "Criterion B: Restricted, repetitive patterns of behaviors, interests, or activities, as manifested by at least two of the following, currently or by history: \u2013Stereotyped or repetitive motor movements, use of objects, or speech(48) -An example of stereotyped speech is echolalia, described below(48) \u2013Insistence on sameness, inflexible adherence to routines, or ritualized patterns of verbal or nonverbal behavior (e.g., rigid thought patterns; wanting the same sequence of activities in each therapy session)(48)  \u2013Highly restricted, fixated interests that are abnormal in intensity or focus (e.g., a strong preoccupation with comic books to the exclusion of all other activities and interests)(48) \u2013Hyper-  or hyporeactivity to sensory input or unusual interest in sensory aspects of the environment (e.g., inability to tolerate loud noises; apparent indifference to pain or temperature)(48) \u2013In addition to documenting the presence of two or more of the above mentioned deficits, the diagnosing clinician must also specify current severity level of restrictive, repetitive behaviors when diagnosing ASD.(48) Because the severity of behaviors in ASD is known to fluctuate over time, the severity label is used to refer only to current severity(48)",
            "Criterion C: Symptoms must be present in the early developmental period (but may not become fully manifested until social demands exceed limited capacities, or may be masked by learned strategies later in life)(48)",
            "Criterion D: Symptoms cause clinical significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of current functioning(48)",
            "Criterion E: These disturbances are not better explained by intellectual disability or global developmental delay(48) \u2013Intellectual disability does often co-occur  with ASD; in order for both diagnoses to be applicable, social functioning would be impaired more than would be expected given the individual\u2019s developmental level and cognitive functioning(48)",
            "The diagnosing clinician will also specify the following when diagnosing ASD: \u2013With or without accompanying intellectual impairment(48) \u2013With or without accompanying language impairment(48) \u2013Associated with another neurodevelopmental, mental, or behavioral disorder(48) \u2013With catatonia(48)",
            "Severity levels in ASD(48) \u2013Level 3 \u2013 requiring very substantial support \u2013Level 2 \u2013 requiring substantial support \u2013Level 1 \u2013 requiring supports"

A communication assessment should be appropriate to the skills of the individual and assess all modes of communication that are usedSpeech development in individuals with ASD is usually commensurate with mental age. If the individual uses speech for communication and if there are concerns about speech/articulation ability, a standardized test or an informal (nonstandardized) analysis can be used to determine errors that have a high frequency of occurrence, as well as those that are functionally important for the individual. A sound inventory can be completed for those who have severely limited speech. For specific sounds, the number of omissions, substitutions, distortions, and additions can be calculated.

Syntax and semantic abilities usually correspond with mental age, and pragmatic ability is usually the most impaired in individuals with ASD. Informal language measures are(29)Videotaped language samples are useful for examining the individual\u2019s pragmatic skills, such as responsiveness to communication, ability to interpret a conversational partner's intent, ability to retell a narrative or past experience, metalinguistic skills, and ability to maintain topic.(29) Language samples can also assess word use/ vocabulary, presence of echolalia, use of nonverbal communication, and syntactic elements, such as pronoun use. Prompts for a conversational sample include \"Tell me about your family,\" \"Tell me about work,\" and \"Tell me what you do when you're not at work.\" When possible, observe the individual's language in a daily situation, such as the workplaceThere are no comprehensive formal language measures that have been standardized for adults with ASD.

For typical adults, mentalizing happens automatically; when encountering another person, a typical adult will understand that person\u2019s behavior within the context of the person\u2019s thoughts and feelings. For example, if a cashier is abrupt and hurried at the store, a typical adult might look at the clock and realize the store actually closed five minutes early and this cashier would probably like to go home on time. For an adult with ASD, authors of the meta-analysis  reported that despite visual and verbal information, these adults have difficulty mentalizing and processing these cues(65)(23) Ages 16 years to 90 years, 11 months -In a study of adults conducted in the United States with ASD, researchers found that compared to typically developing adults, individuals with high-functioning  ASD had lower scores on all cognitive domains of the WAIS-IV  with the most significant differences in the measures of verbal comprehension and processing speed(24)(25) An assessment of self-sufficiency  across the lifespan, thecommunication skills, daily living skills, socialization skills, and motor skills from birth to age 90 years",

            "Treatment approaches \u2013Applied behavior analysis (ABA): ABA is based on the theory of operant conditioning and is designed to eliminate negative behaviors and increase positive ones. Operant conditioning principles include shaping (reinforcing increasingly accurate versions of desired responses), chaining (reinforcing individual responses in a sequence to form a complex behavior), and discrimination training (teaching the individual to perform a behavior when one antecedent is presented and not when another is presented). Therapy is usually provided in a one-to-one  discrete trial format, and targets can include a variety of communicative functions, including preverbal communication, requesting desired items, social language (e.g., please, thank you), positive interactions with peers, answering wh-questions, and overall increased communication.(40) The administration of ABA requires specific training. For more information, see research and guidelines by Lovaas(42) \u2013Gentle teaching: Gentle teaching incorporates many of the principles of ABA, including extinction, fading, reinforcement, and errorless learning; however, it has been described as emphasizing the nurturing relationship between the therapist and the individual with ASD(41) \u2013Functional communication training (FCT): The method of FCT is to determine the motivation for or purpose of a challenging behavior and then teach a more appropriate replacement behavior. This approach is often used with individuals with ASD who exhibit challenging behaviors (e.g., tantrums, aggression, self-injury).  Most of the research on FCT is limited to single-subject  studies, but there is preliminary evidence that FCT is effective in eliminating negative behaviors and generalization of new language skills to other people and environments(43) \u2013Environmental modifications: The purpose of environmental modifications is to provide the individual with increased opportunities to communicate, as well as promote communication development and/or literacy learning. Environmental modifications may include picture schedules, picture prompts, and elimination of visual distractions  \u2013Video modeling -The purpose of video modeling is to teach an individual with ASD a particular communication skill through observational learning. The video format is intended to decrease the anxiety that might be associated with direct therapy. Video modeling has been found to be helpful for teaching vocational skills to adults with ASD(74) -Steps in the video modeling approach(43) -Videotaped images are made of a target behavior or skill -The individual watches the video clips -After viewing the clips, the individual practices the skills with a therapist -The individual then practices the skill in other settings to provide for generalization -The individual observes the video again as necessary \u2013Social skills interventions: Social skills interventions include social skills training, the use of social stories and cognitive behavioral training: -Social skills training -In social skills training, individuals are taught skills, such as perspective taking, conversational skills, problem solving, emotional awareness, and regulation -Methods used include coaching, modeling, role plays, social scripts, feedback, and written cueing in individual or group therapy -In a study conducted in the United States of four college students with ASD and cognitive difficulties, researchers investigated the effectiveness of a program targeting social skills (primarily perspective taking in social interactions), voice, and speech during an eight-week  intervention program (sessions two times per week).(29) One subtest of the CASL (the Pragmatic Judgment subtest) was administered before and after intervention. V oice and speech goals were targeted in individual sessions but were not specifically described in the study. Social skills were targeted in group sessions in which participants took turns playing themselves and the role of another person. At the end of eight weeks, three of the four students showed significant improvement in the raw score of the Pragmatic Judgment subtest of the CASL -In a quasi-experimental  study conducted in the United States, researchers examined the feasibility and effects of a cognitive behavioral intervention on social-cognitive  functioning in adults with high-functioning  ASD.(44) The intervention group (n = 6) received therapy targeting components of social cognition, including emotion recognition in themselves and others, and social interaction skills; a control group (n = 5) received other interventions, including individual therapy and job skills coaching. Intervention was conducted over an 18-week  period, once a week in 50-minute  sessions. Participants in the intervention group showed significant improvement in theory-of-mind  skills and improvement in social communication skills; the control group did not show these improvements -Authors of a review of the literature on the effects of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for adults with ASD aiming to reduce comorbid psychiatric symptoms and increase social and communication skills found that the results of the studies reviewed were mixed, with no definitive evidence supporting the use of CBT with this population. Review authors reported that there is a need for increased quantitative research regarding the effects of CBT on adults with ASD in order to make more substantial conclusions regarding efficacy(59) -Interventions to improve executive functioning: Picture schedules, video prompting, and personal digital assistants (PDAs) have been used to assist individuals with ASD in initiating and completing tasks -AAC -Many adults with ASD do not develop oral language to meet their daily communication needs and may benefit from augmented language input to increase their language comprehension, as well as from use of AAC to express themselves(33) -Unaided approaches to AAC involve using one\u2019s body to communicate by means of manual signs, gestures, vocalizations, facial expressions, or body movements(45) -Aided communication approaches include \"light\"-technology  devices and high-technology devices. Light-technology AAC refers to nonelectronic external devices such as alphabet boards, symbol-based  topic boards, dry erase boards, and programs such as the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS). High-technology systems are electronic devices, such as speech-generating  devices (SGDs)(46) -In a study conducted in the United States, researchers investigated the effectiveness of a communication and literacy program (CALI) in improving functional communication and literacy skills in five adults (22-35  years) with ASD and cognitive difficulties working in a sheltered workshop.(33) CALI focuses on increasing the  participants' community access, empowerment, and independence. Baseline measures included formal and informal assessment of reading skills, such as phonemic awareness, letter-sound  correspondence, word identification, and text comprehension. Observations of the sheltered workshop setting assessed the extent of communication supports at baseline. Findings revealed that the individuals with ASD worked in isolation for much of the day and had little control over scheduled activities. In addition, they had little opportunity to engage in reciprocal communicative interactions and limited engagement in literacy-related  activities. CALI was delivered in individual sessions two hours a week with communication and literacy activities continuing throughout the day. Three adults participated for two years while the other participants discontinued after a shorter period due to scheduling conflicts. The program contained four major components: 1) modification of the environment to provide communication support (e.g., choice boards, picture displays/schedules) and literacy support in the form of a literacy center in which print materials were made available to participants in their free time; 2) theme-based  intervention to promote functional communication with AAC; 3) literacy skill development (e.g., guided reading, self-selected reading, word study, and writing); and 4) transfer of communication skills to a community setting by use of field trips. The researchers reported measurable gains in communicative competence for all five participants, as well as transfer of gains to the community setting -For detailed information on treatment of individuals with ASD utilizing AAC, see the series of Clinical Reviews on this topic .
