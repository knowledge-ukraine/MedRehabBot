            "Anatomy review(5) \u2013The posterior compartment of the leg contains the superficial and deep compartments. When referring to calf strain, most authors are referring to the muscles of the superficial compartment, also known as the triceps surae: the gastrocnemius (with its medial and lateral heads), plantaris, and soleus",
            "A calf-muscle  strain injury (CMSI) is a muscle injury due to fiber tearing, usually in the mid-section  of the calf. The medial gastrocnemius is most often affected. The lateral gastrocnemius, soleus, plantaris, and flexor hallucis longus muscles (part of the deep posterior compartment) may also be involved(5)",
            "Fibers typically tear in the muscle belly or in the gastrocnemius-soleus  myotendinous complex(5)",
            "Grading the severity of CMSI(6) \u20131st degree: tearing of relatively few fibers -The muscle is stretched, causing micro tears in the muscle fibers. Recovery takes approximately 2 to 4 weeks \u20132nd degree: partial tearing of many muscle fibers; muscle and tendon remain partly intact -Full recovery takes approximately 4 to 8 weeks \u20133rd degree: The most severe CMSI, with a complete tearing or rupture of muscle fibers (See Clinical Review\u2026Achilles Tendon Rupture ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T708413) -Obvious muscle defect/deformity -Surgery is often needed to repair the rupture site -Return to sport may take months",
            "Acute injury is most likely CMSI to gastrocnemius or plantaris and is associated with quick, sharp movement during sprinting or jumping. As it was first observed in lawn tennis players, CMSI is also known as \u201ctennis leg.\u201d Soleus injuries have a more gradual onset, typically within 24 hours of precipitating even, and are associated with fatigue and overtraining(5)",
            "The differential diagnosis should include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) when pain and swelling are near the popliteal fossa(5)",
            "Specific evidence-based  treatment guidelines for CMSI are lacking. Most research onCMSI is in athletes, especially runners  or application of equipment . Desired Outcomes/Outcome Measures"

Limit the period of immobilization to the time needed to restore sufficient strength for safe therapeutic exercise. Restrict physical activity to avoid pain.

            "Some research has looked at the timing of beginning treatment after injury. The following was reported when 50 amateur athletes with severe acute injury of the thigh muscle or calf muscle either started treatment 2 days after injury or 9 days after injury: \u2013All the patients in this Danish RCT completed daily repeated static stretching in week one of the protocol, daily isometric loading with increasing load (weeks 2 to 4), dynamic loading with increasing resistance 3 times per week (weeks 5 to 8), and functional exercises combined with heavy strength training 3 times per week (weeks 9 to 12).There were no differences reported in MRI measurements (measuring tissue inflammation and perfusion) or strength measures between  groups, although there was a trend in the early rehabilitation group toward having less pain and more confidence in their abilities(12) \u2013An earlier RCT by the same group showed that patients who received early rehabilitation were able to return to play significantly sooner than patients who received the later rehabilitation (median of 62.5 days versus 83 days, respectively)(13)"

            "Acute phase: control ROM and restrict specific activities that provoke pain, but prevent unnecessary immobilization. Try gentle seated active plantar flexion and dorsiflexion. Encourage WB as tolerated. Recommend that the patient treat pain and swelling using PRICE using PRICE (protection, rest, icing, compression, elevation) approach 2\u20134 times daily(6)",
            "Physical agents/mechanical modalities: The effectiveness of cryotherapy, ultrasound, or electrostimulation for CMSI rehabilitation has not been investigated in randomized controlled studies. Heat pack or therapeutic ultrasound may help increase tissue elasticity prior to stretching or manual therapy",

            "Stretching exercises: in subacute phase, progress ankle plantar flexion ROM (without increasing pain); long-term therapeutic goal is to match flexibility of the contralateral side",
            "Functional training: progress to dynamic ankle plantar flexion exercises using elastic bands or tubing, one-footed  hops, duck walk, run forward and backward at half speed, jog figure-8s  at half speed(6)",
            "Sports-specific  training: gradually progress running at speeds to near-maximal.  Add agility running, jumping, and drills specific to sport(5)",
