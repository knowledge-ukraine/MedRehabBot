The pharyngeal phase is the initiation of the swallowing reflex, when the food is squeezed down the throat and the airway is closed off to prevent aspiration (food or liquid entering the airway) or choking. In the esophageal phase, the openings at the top and bottom of the esophagus move  the food or liquid to the stomach by relaxing and tightening.(6) Dysphagia symptoms associated with MG include difficulty chewing, drooling, nasal regurgitation of fluids, coughing after swallowing, and choking on foods and secretions(1,3,7) Causes, Pathogenesis, & Risk Factors"

Scales, surveys, and checklists are commonly used in the clinical examination but often do not include normative data, standardization, validation, or guidelines for interpretation. SLP knowledge of normal oral motor development and feeding function are essential when evaluating infants and children(24) -Clinical Feeding Evaluation of Infants (CFEI) scale: Evaluation of an infant\u2019s ability to suck on a bottle and/or breast. Includes assessment of child\u2019s feeding history, oral motor skills, oral tactile responses, suck-swallow-breath coordination, general motor control, and general physical state during feeding and swallowing(25) -Neonatal Oral Motor Assessment Scale (NOMAS): Evaluation of sucking in infants (up to 3 months of age). Aspects of sucking behavior are classified as normal, disorganized, or dysfunctional(26) -Pre-speech  Assessment Scale: Rating scale that examines swallowing and voice in children up to 2 years of age. Ratings include duration of the meal, amount of intake, food consistencies, positioning, sucking from a nipple, sipping from a cup, and coordination of suck-swallow-breath(27) -Oral-Motor/Feeding  Rating Scale: Lip, cheek, tongue, and jaw movements are rated during a typical meal. This scale can be used with children from 1 year of age through adulthood(28) -The Multidisciplinary Feeding Profile: A statistically based protocol for patients who are dependent feeders. Scaled ratings are made for posture, tone, reflexes, general motor control, orofacial structures, orofacial sensory input, orofacial motor control, ventilation, and functional feeding assessment(29) -Assessment Scale of Oral Functions in Feeding: Ratings of lip, jaw, and tongue movement during ingestion of liquids and solid foods. Assessment of sipping from a cup, coughing, gagging, and hypersensitivity associated with feeding and  swallowing. A checklist allows for indication of abnormal oral structures, oral reflexes, positioning, diet, utensils, and feeding(30) -Preschool Motor Speech Evaluation: Assessment of oral motor, oral sensory, and oral motor speech abilities in children aged 18 months to 5 years(31) -Dysphagia Disorder Survey (DDS): Standardized screening survey that can be used with children from 2 years of age through adulthood. Assesses body mass index, restrictions in food textures and viscosity, dependence in feeding, and need for special utensils or positioning. Provides information on the severity of the swallowing disorder and can be used as an outcome measure(32) -In a study conducted in the United States, researchers examined results from the DDS taken from a total of 654 individuals from two residential facilities to assess psychometric properties of the assessment. Individuals included in the study ranged from 2 to over 61 years of age. Researchers concluded that the DDS was factorially stable across the two samples of patients and demonstrated substantial internal consistency reliability. The DDS is a reliable and valid test for dysphagia and related feeding disorders in individuals aged 2+ years(60) -Nutrition and Swallowing Checklist: A tool developed to screen for nutrition and swallowing problems in persons with intellectual disabilities. The checklist format allows for caregiver involvement in identifying risks and managing swallowing difficulties(33) -Dysphagia Outcome and Severity Scale: A tool to assist the clinician in describing the level of severity (seven levels) of the dysphagia and in making recommendations for nutrition, diet, and independence(33)",
                "VFSS/modified barium swallow study (MBSS)/videofluoroscopic examination (VFE): A VFSS is performed when the dysphagia team has concerns about the pharyngeal phase of swallowing and the complete swallowing sequence. A VFSS is completed in collaboration with a physician (radiologist or physiatrist).(11) Most clinical practices follow the protocol originally described by Logemann, and adaptations of this protocol for infants and children are described in Arvedson and Lefton-Greif.(34,35) The assessment must be age-appropriate  with regard to positioning, presentation, and viscosity of material.(1) The patient eats and drinks a variety of developmentally appropriate liquids and solids mixed with barium while images are recorded with videofluorography. All patients should be examined in the lateral and frontal positions to obtain information on movements of the swallow and symmetry of bolus flow and pharyngeal wall contraction. The SLP examines for the presence of aspiration and the effectiveness of presenting different food consistencies or of modifying posture.(11) In contrast to the CSE, the VFSS provides critical information on the pharyngeal phase of the swallow.(21) Given the unnatural surroundings, swallowing function observed during a VFSS is not necessarily identical to that used at mealtimes.(36) Other variables which can influence swallowing function include anxiety, fatigue, and medications.(37) Due to the harmful effects of ionizing radiation on children, a repeat VFSS should only be considered when there are specific questions that require answers from a repeat study; a VFSS should not be used frequently to monitor changes in swallowing.(38) During the VFSS, the following physiologic components might be observed:(37) -Lip closure (ability to contain a liquid bolus) -Lingual elevation (the back of the tongue is slightly elevated) -Tongue-to-palatal  seal -Bolus preparation/mastication -Bolus transport/movement of the tongue (movement of the bolus to the back of the oral cavity) -Initiation of the pharyngeal swallow (swallow should be initiated when the bolus reaches the region of the posterior oral cavity) -Soft palate elevation and retraction -Laryngeal elevation -Anterior hyoid excursion -Laryngeal closure -Pharyngeal contraction -Pharyngoesophageal segment opening -Tongue base retraction -Epiglottic inversion -Esophageal clearance -For detailed information on a VFSS for the pediatric population, see Clinical Review\u2026Dysphagia Assessment: Modified Barium Swallow (Pediatrics) ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T709077 ",
                "Endoscopic assessment of swallowing function/fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES): FEES is performed to evaluate the anatomy and physiology of the pharynx and the larynx, pharyngeal swallow function, and the patient\u2019s ability to manage secretions and swallow foods and liquids.(11) In addition, it can be used to explore a variety of diagnostic interventions, such as varying bolus consistency, varying posture, or making use of visual feedback for reinforcement.(39) After the insertion of the endoscope, the patient can engage in normal feeding behavior during the evaluation. Food must be light in color to enhance visibility (e.g., milk, pudding, yogurt, bread). FEES is preferred over VFSS when patients have safety issues related to radiation exposure or when they need retesting. Due to the invasive nature of the procedure, it might be difficult to obtain accurate representation of a normal swallow in young children.(24) The American Speech-Language-Hearing  Association has published several online documents relevant to the technical aspects of FEES and the qualifications required to perform FEES(40) -For detailed information on assessment of swallowing by FEES, see Clinical Review\u2026Dysphagia Assessment: Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES) ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T709038",
                "Ultrasonography: Infant sucking and oral transit times can be examined by ultrasonography, an instrumental procedure involving transducers that use high-frequency  sound waves to create images. In infants and children, the transducer is placed under the chin as they swallow liquid or food. The ultrasonographic scanner can display images of the nipple, tongue surface, hard and soft palates, and hyoid during infant feeding(11)",
                "Pulse oximetry: Oximetry is used to evaluate hemoglobin oxygen saturation levels before and after feeding. Most infants have an oxygen saturation level of at least 95%. Low saturation levels (below 90%) indicate some degree of hypoxia(41)",
                "Cervical auscultation: Cervical auscultation involves the use of a stethoscope on the lateral side of the thyroid cartilage to listen to sounds associated with breathing and swallowing patterns. Limitations of cervical auscultation include a lack of normative data and clear guidelines for interpretation of the procedure. In addition, many movements associated with swallowing are silent(24) -For detailed information on assessment of swallowing with cervical auscultation for the pediatric population, see Clinical Review\u2026Dysphagia Assessment: Cervical Auscultation (Pediatrics) ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T709101",

                "Esophagram: An esophagram differs from an esophageal screening performed in a VFSS in that it incorporates large bolus swallows of liquids with varying densities. The patient is usually examined swallowing during side lying or erect positions. The esophagram can be used to evaluate peristalsis, gastroesophageal reflux, and transit time if esophageal dysphagia is suspected(42,43)",

Due to its limitations, a CSE should be used as a complement to other instrumental measures, rather than in  isolation. If oral intake is considered relatively safe, the patient might be observed swallowing different consistencies of food during the CSE.(21) Cervical auscultation (the use of a stethoscope to assess swallow sounds and airway sounds) can be used during CSE at the discretion of the evaluating SLP.(21,23) Adapt the CSE to the developmental and cognitive level -A comprehensive case history and review of medical records(11) -Family interview -Assessment of oral structures and motor function. Note the appearance of the oral mucosa (e.g., any inflammation or infection that might affect the oral stage of swallowing) and any pooling of saliva in the oral cavity. An inability to swallow might cause the saliva to pool in the mouth. If applicable, evaluate dentition in terms of the number and appearance of teeth, level of oral hygiene, and general dental care.(11) Examine the facial, labial, and lingual ROM, speed, and strength. Examine velar elevation -Assessment of speech and vocal quality(11) -Assessment of feeding during a regular meal (when possible) to observe the patient\u2019s skills in coordinating of respiration and swallowing in a natural environment.(11) Assess patient\u2019s ability to achieve labial seal and contain bolus. Examine retrieval of different food consistencies from a spoon, cup, and straw -Assessment of the pharyngeal phase by using palpation. To assess tongue-based  function, hyoid motion, and laryngeal motion during a swallow, place one finger under the patient\u2019s chin at the base of the tongue, the next finger on the hyoid bone, the next finger above the larynx, and the next finger below the larynx.

For example, if a patient reports fatigue while chewing, the diet can be changed to mechanical soft texture.(46) Foods that are chewy, spicy, crumbly, sticky, or include mixed textures (cereal and milk) should be avoided.(47) If the patient reports aspiration of liquids or difficulty containing the liquid in the oral cavity, the clinician might investigate the used of thickened liquids; however, it cannot be assumed that all patients benefit from thickened liquids.(48) Clinicians should rule out all other reasons for malnutrition (e.g., socioeconomic status) and explore all possible intervention options before recommending thickened liquids or altered diets. The clinician should also ensure (by observing modifications during VFSS), rather than assume, that aspiration is not occurring with thickened liquids \u2013The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cautions consumers against using commercial gum-based thickeners (e.g., SimplyThick) for infants from birth to 1 year of age, especially when the products are used to thicken breast milk, as they are associated with a risk of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC)(63) \u2013For detailed information on diet modification for dysphagia, see Clinical Review\u2026Dysphagia: Swallowing Therapy \u2013Compensatory ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T903567",
