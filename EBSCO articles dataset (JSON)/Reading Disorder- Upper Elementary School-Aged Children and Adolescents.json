            "A single description of reading disabilities is complicated by the different causes of reading difficulties, the different labels for reading disabilities (e.g., dyslexia, learning disability), and different models for identification (see Diagnostic tests completed , below). In this summary, the term reading disabilities encompasses any difficulty with any of the language-based/linguistic  components of reading that would not be expected for a child's age and/or developmental level. These components include phonological awareness (PA), decoding, sight-word  recognition, reading fluency, spelling, and reading comprehension. Some students with reading disabilities in upper elementary grades and middle school may have not demonstrated reading difficulties in the lower elementary grades. Reading difficulties may surface as texts become more challenging(2)"

            "Several meta-analyses  and reviews have described intervention effects for students in the upper grades: \u2013Researchers in the United States conducted a meta-analysis  of 10 studies with a pretest/posttest control group design with students in grades 5\u20139 obtained from a literature search in peer-reviewed  journals (1960\u20132009).  Findings included:(36) -Effect sizes were low across a variety of interventions and combinations of interventions. There were no significant differences in effects related to the type of reading skill or combination of skills addressed (e.g., comprehension, phonics, fluency) -Older samples of students yielded smaller effect sizes than younger samples of students -Strategies used effectively to improve reading in younger students are not as effective for students in the upper elementary and middle school grades \u2013Authors of a meta-analysis  of reading interventions for struggling readers in grades 4\u201312  (published in 1980\u20132011) analyzed the effects of interventions in 67 published studies.(37) Findings included:  -Reading interventions produce positive results for students in grades 4\u201312,  an average of half a standard deviation across studies -Studies conducted from 1980 through 2004 had larger effects than those conducted from 2005 through 2011. Researchers hypothesized that this difference was due to a variety of factors present in later studies, including greater use of standardized measures, which are associated with lower effect sizes; improvement in the comparison groups\u2019 instruction; an increase in teacher-delivered treatment; differences in participant characteristics (more inclusive of students with lower intellectual abilities); and more rigorous and complex research designs -Reading comprehension instruction was included in nearly all of the multicomponent interventions and reading comprehension interventions were associated with higher effects than fluency interventions. The authors concluded that teaching reading comprehension strategies to struggling readers in grades 4\u201312  is beneficial \u2013A synthesis of extensive (intensive) reading interventions (provided in 75 or more sessions) for students with reading difficulties in grades 4\u201312  published between 1995 and 2011 reported on 19 studies and analyzed 10 studies in a meta-analysis.(38) Findings included the following: -Extensive interventions can have a small but positive effect on student learning across a variety of reading outcomes (e.g., reading comprehension, reading fluency, word reading, word reading fluency, and spelling) -The majority of studies implemented multicomponent interventions -Student outcomes did not differ with respect to number of hours of intervention, group size, or age",
            "Phonics instruction/word study: Phonics instruction, or word study, focuses on teaching letter-sound  correspondences and letter pattern-sound  correspondences and how to use them in spelling and reading.(23) Systematic phonics instruction differs from incidental phonics instruction in that a scope and sequence of phonics elements are taught in a systematic way rather than highlighting phonics elements incidentally as they appear in text(23) \u2013Older students who have decoding problems often can decode single-syllable  words correctly but struggle with multisyllable words. They often have difficulty dividing the word into parts and using word-analysis  strategies to decode unfamiliar words in text(24) \u2013Advanced word study focuses on analyzing morphology (e.g., prefixes, suffixes) and letter patterns. Students are taught to break apart difficult words into smaller, familiar units and then read the words by blending the units together(24)",
            "Fluency: Fluency is the ability to read accurately with speed and proper expression. There are two main approaches that have been used for building fluency, guided repeated oral reading and independent silent reading \u2013Guided repeated oral reading: Students who have poor reading fluency often are asked to repeatedly read passages with guidance from a teacher, clinician, parent, or peer in order to have multiple exposures to the same words and to increase their speed and accuracy during text reading -Results of a review of research on repeated reading with children with LDs (kindergarten through 12th grade) indicated that this practice is lacking a strong evidence base due to the lack of studies meeting methodological criteria for quality research based on standards developed by Horner et al. and Gersten et al.(25,26,27) The authors proposed that even in the absence of firm evidence, teachers and clinicians may continue to implement repeated reading practice because 1) it is aligned with multiple theoretical frameworks that suggest its use for students who need to improve fluency, and 2) effect sizes in meta-analyses  of fluency interventions have indicated that repeated reading is likely to positively affect fluency outcomes for those who need to improve fluency(27)",
            "V ocabulary instruction: V ocabulary instruction has been recognized as an essential part of comprehensive reading intervention for older students who struggle with reading(20,23) \u2013Authors of a best-practice  guide for reading interventions for adolescents with reading difficulties (4th grade through 12th grade) synthesized the results of 15 vocabulary intervention studies and concluded that students should receive explicit vocabulary instruction as part of reading and language arts classes as well as part of content-area classes (e.g., social studies, science). Students should be given explicit instruction on new words with student-friendly  definitions as well as assistance in learning new words independently. The SLP may work with the classroom teacher in identifying words to teach, teaching words, and providing more intensive instruction for students with reading difficulties. Specific recommendations include:(20) -A portion of class time should be dedicated to explicit vocabulary instruction. Strategies for explicit instruction include direct instruction on the word and meaning, matching words and definitions, using semantic maps, and helping students to look up word meanings -Students need repeated exposure to new words in multiple oral and written contexts (e.g., preview the word before reading it, read the word, answer comprehension questions that include the new word)  -Students need multiple opportunities to use new words in discussion, writing, and extended reading -Students should be provided with strategies to make them independent word learners (e.g., tools to help them find meanings of words such as online dictionaries, learn the meaning of prefixes, roots, suffixes)",
            "Text comprehension strategies: Students can be taught specific cognitive strategies or reasoning skills with the goal of improving their comprehension. In the upper grades, comprehension strategies as well as opportunities for extended discussion of text meaning are particularly important in assisting students to understand content-area  texts.(20) Strategies can be applied in all classes, particularly in content-area  classes (e.g., science, social studies, math, reading/language arts). Text comprehension strategies are beneficial but are likely insufficient for older students who have significant difficulties with vocabulary, background knowledge, and/or decoding \u2013Types of strategies/techniques include:(20,23,24) -activation of prior knowledge: Students might not have sufficient background knowledge to fully comprehend content-area  texts. The teacher or SLP teaches the students to preview headings or key concepts and make prediction charts prior to reading the text to activate prior knowledge and to prepare the student for the text. Teachers can also show short video clips and orient students geographically by using a map.(39) The same materials used to preview texts can be used after text reading to assist in reviewing, summarizing, confirming, or refuting predictions -comprehension monitoring: Students are taught to be more aware of their understanding (or lack thereof) (e.g., take notes on confusing words as they read) -cooperative learning: Students work together to use reading strategies -graphic and semantic organizers: Readers make visual or graphic representations of what they read -question answering: The teacher/SLP poses questions before, during, or after reading -question generation: Students are taught to ask themselves questions about what they read -story structure: Students are taught to use story mapping (using a graphic organizer to outline the parts of a story) to help them recall the details and parts of a story -summarization: After reading a text, students are asked to summarize (orally or by writing) the main idea of what they have just read. Students need to be taught explicitly how to find the main idea.(39)Several strategies have been used to help students find the main idea. One established strategy is the three-step  \u201cGet the Gist\u201d strategy, in which students are asked to 1) identify the main \u201cwho\u201d or \u201cwhat,\u201d 2) identify the most important information about the main \u201cwho\u201d or \u201cwhat,\u201d and 3) combine that information in a sentence to talk about the main idea.(40) Sentence stems such as \u201cThe main idea is\u2026\u201d or \u201cThe passage is about\u2026\u201d can be used -peer-mediated  practice: Students can work as partners to practice the strategies above(39) \u2013Authors of a best-practice  guide synthesized the results of 5 RCTs and 1 single subject study that explored the effects of using comprehension strategies. Results indicated that there is strong evidence supporting the teaching of strategies to improve adolescents' reading comprehension ability. Based upon the findings of the synthesized studies, the following recommendations were made:(20) -Select a strategy (see strategies mentioned above) that is appropriate for the type of text (e.g., main-idea  summarizing is appropriate for expository but not narrative text) and show the student how different strategies may be used with different texts -Use texts that are at the student\u2019s reading level. The text should not be too difficult or too easy -Use direct and explicit instruction on how to use the strategy as well as modeling and guided support when teaching new strategies -Help the student understand that the goal of strategy use is to better understand the next -Provide multiple opportunities for practice (e.g., with peers) \u2013Results of a meta-analysis  of 40 reading comprehension intervention studies (kindergarten through 12th grade) published between 1995 and 2006 indicated that effect sizes were high for criterion-referenced  measures (0.69 for treatment effects; 0.75 for generalization effects) and moderate for standardized measures (0.52).(28) The authors concluded that these outcomes were similar to, though slightly lower than, those of previously published meta-analyses.  A wide variety of treatment methods were found to be effective, including text enhancements, questioning, and cognitive strategies. Most of the treatment approaches included strategies to assist students in maintaining attention and thinking more systematically about what they had just read. Examples of strategies include highlighting, outlining, illustrating, using graphic organizers, summarizing the text, predicting outcomes, proving main ideas, analyzing text structure, and providing explanations. The authors concluded that students with reading disabilities did not spontaneously employ such  strategies and that any instruction to help them systematically employ these techniques would improve their ability to construct meaning from text \u2013In a practice guide on adolescent reading interventions, researchers synthesized the results of 5 studies that explored the effects of extended discussion on reading comprehension.(20) The researchers found moderate support for the use of discussions in improving comprehension of text. Discussion questions that have the most impact on student reading comprehension are those that ask students to defend their point of view by reasoning or referring to information in the text",
            "Educational technology: Computer-assisted  instruction (CAI) can include programs that are used for supplemental instruction as well as those that are used as the core reading program(43) \u2013Authors of a synthesis on educational technology applications used to improve reading skills of struggling readers included 20 studies of almost 7,000 students in grades 1\u20136.(43) Reviewers examined 4 types of educational technology applications: 1) traditional supplemental CAI, 2) comprehensive models that include CAI and non-computer  activities as a core reading program, 3) small-group  integrated supplemental programs, and 4) Fast ForWord, a distinct approach emphasizing auditory discrimination. They found that small-group,  integrated applications produced the largest effect sizes (ES = 0.32). The mean effect size for all studies was much lower for upper grades (ES = 0.07) than lower grades (ES = 0.36). Comprehensive models such as READ 180, ReadAbout, and Fast ForWord did not produce meaningful positive effect sizes. Reviewers concluded that more studies are needed to validate effectiveness of all technology applications \u2013Computer-based  intervention/training in rapid auditory processing: Fast ForWord is a computer program designed to improve an individual's detection of rapidly presented and changing speech stimuli. The program is based on the hypothesis that children's reading and language deficits are due to a general auditory processing deficit(35) -The effectiveness of Fast ForWord for improving reading and language abilities for 2nd- and 7th-grade  students at risk for language and reading difficulties was examined in an RCT in 8 schools (274 7th-grade  students were randomly assigned to treatment and control).(35) Participants in the treatment group received supplemental instruction with Fast ForWord (100 min/day, 5 days a week for 4 to 8 weeks). The control group received no additional intervention. The 7th-grade  students used a middle/high school version of the software that had graphics and content tailored to their age and grade levels. The authors concluded that use of Fast ForWord did not improve overall language and reading comprehension scores on a standardized achievement test",
            "Increase student motivation in literacy learning: Authors of a practice guide on adolescent reading interventions synthesized the results of 6 studies and 2 meta-analyses  that investigated the effects of strategies to increase student motivation to read and engage in learning.(20) They found moderately strong evidence indicating that strategies to increase student motivation lead to the growth of literacy skills. External motivators such as grades or external rewards did not lead to improvements in text recall. Methods to increase student motivation and engagement include:(20,24) \u2013assisting students to create performance-related  or content-related  reading goals and helping them monitor their progress \u2013allowing students to make choices regarding topics to write or read about and selection of materials \u2013making literacy experiences relevant to students' lives by tying classroom assignments to real-world  applications \u2013increasing student social interactions related to reading",
            "RTI: The RTI approach is a multi-tier  framework that involves universal screening to identify students at risk for reading difficulties, systematic evidence-based  classroom instruction, ongoing progress monitoring, and implementation of more intensive interventions for students who require more intensive instruction(29) \u2013The first tier of the model involves providing high-quality, evidence-based  instruction in a general education classroom. Teachers in the upper grades should focus on improving vocabulary and comprehension instruction across all content areas with the help of coaching and ongoing professional development.(41) In early grades, all students are screened at the beginning of the school year with a criterion-referenced  or norm-referenced  instrument to determine which students may benefit from additional instruction (e.g., students who fall below the 25th percentile on a screening measure). In contrast to struggling readers in early grades, struggling readers in later grades are likely to be previously identified. One suggestion that has been proposed by researchers is for school personnel to use scores obtained by the state-level reading assessment provided as part of No Child Left Behind to identify students in need of more intensive instruction(41,42) \u2013The second tier of the model consists of small-group instruction and is directed toward students who continue to have difficulties despite the high-quality  classroom instruction. Their responsiveness to more intensive intervention is monitored after a relatively short period of time (e.g., 8 weeks) \u2013The third tier is provided for students who respond minimally to the second-tier  intervention and require specialized, more intensive instruction. When students fail to respond or respond minimally to the most intensive tier, or third tier, of instruction, they receive a comprehensive evaluation to determine their eligibility for special education services  \u2013Multiple research studies on RTI have indicated promising gains for children who receive early, evidence-based intervention(30,31,32) \u2013While there are few studies investigating RTI for upper elementary-school-aged  and adolescent students, authors of several studies have found that intensive intervention is effective for such students.(7,33,41,42) Authors of a best-practice guide for adolescent reading interventions reported strong evidence supporting the use of intensive interventions for adolescents who struggle with reading.(20) This intensive intervention should be explicit and address the student's specific reading difficulties (e.g., word level, reading comprehension). Intensity can be increased by increasing time for instruction or providing small-group  or individual instruction \u2013SLPs might work in collaboration with general and special education teachers within an RTI model in roles such as the following: -Collaborating with school professionals to design interventions to improve the first tier of instruction(34) -Administering progress monitoring measures to determine if students are meeting benchmarks and to identify those who need additional instruction(34) -Administering comprehensive reading assessments to pinpoint specific areas of need(20) -Delivering second-  and third-tier  support for at-risk students(34) -Training paraprofessionals to administer progress-monitoring  measures and to provide intensive reading intervention \u2013For detailed information on RTI, see Clinical Review\u2026Response to Intervention (RTI) ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T709175 .

        "Progress-monitoring  measures determine how the child is performing at certain times of the year (benchmarks). These measures are short and are standardized or criterion-based.  One common system of screening and monitoring literacy skills from kindergarten to the 6th grade is the Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS). DIBELS assess phonological awareness, alphabetic principle skills, reading fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension. Students in the upper grades make slower gains than those in the early grades; therefore, it has been recommended that progress monitoring be administered less frequently.(42) Further description of DIBELS and assessments are available online at https://dibels.uoregon.edu/assessment/dibels Patient/Family Education",
