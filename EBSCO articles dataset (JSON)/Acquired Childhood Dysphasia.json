As the child becomes comfortable with each word, the colors then visual prompts are removed; finally, language skills are expected to improveNone specified  Reduced communication skillsIncrease child\u2019s ability to communicate and express needs and wantsSign language (9,13,23,24) _ When the child is unable to comprehend spoken words or produce words verbally, they might be successful using sign language. Signs can be taken from American Sign Language (ASL), Paget-Gorman Sign System, or other formal signed languages; however, signs developed with the child\u2019s family members might be just as effective for communicating desiresThe child, teachers, and family will use sign language to increase successful communicationSigns should be taught to and used with teachers, family members, and friends, if possible Impaired ability to participate in classroom activitiesImprove child\u2019s reading abilitiesClassroom modifications _ The SLP should work with the child\u2019s parents and teachers to facilitate success in the classroom; develop an individualized education program (IEP) in collaboration with the child\u2019s school and family. Ideas from one case study of a child with LKS include:(9) -Use of computer program with visual and auditory reinforcements to help sustain child\u2019s attention -Training child in phonemic awareness (sound/symbol pairings) with one- on-one instruction, color coding, and sounds -A 1:1 aide might improve academic performanceModifications in the classroom are intended to improve the child\u2019s reading performance and attentionNone specified  Reduced auditory comprehensionIncrease child\u2019s comprehension of the spoken wordAuditory training   (23) -\u201cGo-games\u201d \u2013 child is trained to perform a task, such as putting a ball in a bucket, in response to a sound -Once the child has learned to respond to the presence of sounds, he or she is taught to perform different tasks in response to different sounds; initially sounds (such as banging a drum) are made within the child\u2019s view, then behind a screen so the child must rely on auditory input only -The next stage involves using onomatopoeic sounds (such as a lion\u2019s roar) to match with pictures -Finally, the child is trained to distinguish between word pairsChild will learn to discriminate environmental sounds and slowly progress towards discriminating spoken wordsA tape of the session can be provided for the parent to play back to the child at home for increased stimulation Reduced speech productionImprove child\u2019s expressive language skillsCued articulation   (23) -A visual cue is provided to the child for each consonant sound -Visual cue (made with the therapist\u2019s hand), spoken sound, and written letter are presented together -Child is encouraged to create the sounds themselvesChild\u2019s sound repertoire will increase; sounds are then shaped into syllables, then into wordsNone specified  Reduced participation in activities due to poor language skillsIncrease child\u2019s involvement in school and family activitiesCompensatory strategies -Use a visual daily schedule with pictures at home and school(9,23) -Use of a frequency modulation system to reduce background noise (thereby reducing distraction) and provide a louder and clearer auditory input(9)Use of strategies will increase child\u2019s participation in school and extracurricular activitiesStrategies should be used at home and school ."
