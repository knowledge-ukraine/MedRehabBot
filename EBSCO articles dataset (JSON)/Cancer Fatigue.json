            "Cancer-related  fatigue (CRF) is an idiopathic syndrome characterized by persistent tiredness due to cancer or cancer treatment that compromises physical functioning and is not proportional to recent activity(7) \u2013CRF has been reported to occur in 25\u201399%  of cancer patients.(56) Authors of a meta-analysis  reported a pooled prevalence of 52% (84 studies involving 144,813 subjects)(17)",
            "CRF is defined as a distressing, persistent, sense of physical, emotional, and/or cognitive exhaustion or tiredness related to cancer or cancer-related  treatment that interferes with functioning.(7) It is characterized by the following: \u2013Diminished energy and increased need for rest not proportional to energy exerted \u2013It can include -generalized weakness -diminished mental concentration -insomnia or hypersomnia -sleep is often not restorative -increased emotional reactivity -muscle weakness or heaviness",
            "The fatigue is generally considered to have a sensory dimension (fatigue severity, persistence), a physiological dimension (e.g., leg weakness, reduced mental concentration), and a performance dimension (decreased performance of needed or valued activities)(7)",
            "The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and the National Cancer Institute endorse a multimodal treatment approach that includes medications (e.g., for correction of anemia or depression), physical activity, dietary recommendations, cognitive-behavioral interventions, psychotherapy, and sleep hygiene(2,7) \u2013An example of a multimodal treatment approach used in a 10-week  German study consisted of the following:(15) -The psychoeducation fatigue group: CRF comprehension and management, basics of communication, stress management (8 sessions of 75 minutes each) -Sleep education and sleep diary \u2013 two 75-minute sessions -Eurythmy: uses active, rhythmic exercises often on the basis of verses and poems (45 minutes consisting of 30 minutes of exercise and 15 minutes of rest) -Painting therapy  -Exercise therapy: consisted of 3\u20135 45-minute trainer-led  sessions over 10 weeks with patient instructed to exercise at home for 30 minutes a day, 3\u20135 times per week. Training was at 70\u201380%  maximum heartrate and was in the form of walking/running \u2013See Clinical Review\u2026Cancer-Related  Fatigue and Exercise ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T709184 for a further discussion of exercise therapy for cancer patients"

        "Patients often seek information about CRF from the internet. Results of a study to evaluate websites on CRF indicate that quality and accuracy of content was variable and the easiest websites to navigate were not always those with the best information(9) This study examined 25 websites, three of which were identified as providing the most trustworthy information on CRF: \u2013OncoLink,\u201cCancer-Related  Fatigue,\u201d https://www.oncolink.org/support/side-effects/other-side-effects/fatigue-and-cancer/cancer-related-fatigue \u2013Livestrong Foundation, \u201cFatigue,\u201d https://www.livestrong.org/we-can-help/finishing-treatment/fatigue \u2013Cleveland Clinic, \u201cDiseases and Conditions, Fatigue and Cancer Fatigue,\u201d https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/5230-cancer-fatigue Factors considered included accuracy of information and whether websites consistently disclosed authorship, funding sources, and affiliations with medical or charitable institutions. Site maintenance and review, ease of navigating, presence of ads, and need to provide personal information were also considered. Of note, fewer than half of the websites discussed the possible interaction of biological, psychosocial, and other factors despite this being stressed in the literature.(9) It was also noted that almost one third of the sites failed to clearly communicate nonpharmacological intervention options(9)",
