These selected exercises should provide optimum physical challenge with minimal joint loading _ _ Some common back stabilization/ strengthening exercises are supine knee to chest, prone alternating leg lifts, pelvic tilts, bridging, star drill (single-leg stance dynamic strengthening activity) _ _ May also progress balance exercises from static to dynamic in order to maximize core strength and stability (e.g., single-leg stance on level surface to dynamic surface such as wobble board, Bosu ball, 1/2 foam roll)The intensity and duration of exercises should be gradually progressed as patient increases flexibility and strength _ _ Exercises should be modified to patient\u2019s abilities (e.g., increase number of repetitions and/or sets, increase resistance)Instruct patient with an individualized therapeutic home program. These should be performed as part of daily routine per therapist-specific recommendations _ _ Patient and/or primary caregiver must demonstrate independence when performing home program  Radicular pain and other neurogenic complaints (e.g., tingling, burning, numbness)Resolution of radicular complaintsPhysical agent/ modalities   (4) _ Therapeutic agents (hot or cold packs) and TENS may be utilized as adjuncts to therapeutic exercises; however, evidence of their effectiveness is insufficient _ _ Therapeutic exercises (15) _ Sciatic nerve neurodynamic flossing/ technique for 30-60\u00b0 as instructed and demonstrated to the patient and/or primary caregiver _ _ Sciatic nerve flossing can be performed in sitting or in supine _ _ Sitting in a chair with hips and knees at 90\u00b0, flex the neck and then slowly extend the knee. If there is no pain, gradually plantar flex the ankle while further flexing the neck. Slowly dorsiflex the foot and extend the neck and alternate this motion within a pain- free range _ _ If supine, begin by flexing the hip and knee to 90\u00b0.
