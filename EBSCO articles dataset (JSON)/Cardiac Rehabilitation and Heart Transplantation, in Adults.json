            "Heart transplantation (HTx) is the surgical option for end-stage  heart disease/failure. Life expectancy increases in successful cases",

            "Candidates are commonly classified New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV: symptoms of cardiac insufficiency at rest, unable to carry out any physical activity without discomfort, and very poor cardiorespiratory fitness as measured by peak oxygen uptake (VO 2 peak) on exercise testing(1)",
            "The continuing relatively poor physical capacity after HTx likely results in large part from muscular disuse and aerobic deconditioning associated with prolonged illness and physical inactivity(2)",
            "In addition, autonomic denervation of the donor heart diminishes cardiac reserve because sympathetic neural stimulation is lost. The blunted sympathetic drive impairs chronotropic and ionotropic responses to exercise(2)",
            "Transplant recipients are thus commonly referred to exercise rehabilitation for improving VO 2 peak, as well as for reducing coronary risk factors, either preexisting or related to immunosuppressive drug therapy, which is known to promote hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity",
            "For the first few months after HTx, the heart does not respond normally to sympathetic nervous stimulation. Usually the resting HR is higher than expected and the HR response to exercise is delayed, with the peak HR being lower than expected(2)",
            "Supervised exercise training post HTx reliably increases VO 2 peak, lean tissue mass, and muscle strength, even though ventricular function of the grafted heart usually does not improve(13)",
