            "Osteoporosis (OP) is a skeletal disorder that causes bones to weaken and break. It is characterized by decreased bone mineral density (BMD) and weakened bony microvasculature, causing bone fragility(1,2,3,4)",
            "Incidence/prevalence \u2013It is estimated that by 2022, over 12 million persons older than 50 in the United States will have osteoporosis(5,6,7,8) \u2013Approximately 200 million people worldwide are currently diagnosed with osteoporosis and it is more common in women than men. For postmenopausal women, osteoporosis is usually because of reduced estrogen levels.(5,6,8,9) \u2013Over a million fractures in the United States are attributed to OP annually, and 70% are in women(5)"

            "National guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of OP(15,16) \u2013General recommendations -Patient education regarding exercise, dietary supplements, and avoidance of tobacco, alcohol, and caffeine(14) -Programs that target identified impairments in cardiorespiratory endurance, strength, flexibility, posture, balance, and gait -Cardiovascular exercise should involve higher impact exercise (e.g., jogging) if the patient can tolerate it and cleared by physician(14)  -Patients should progress to a program of cardiovascular exercise 3\u20135 times per week at 75\u201380% of maximum heart rate, as appropriate and tolerated \u2013Strength training should focus on hip extensors and abductors, knee extensors, ankle dorsi/plantar flexors, and upper extremity strength training that loads through the wrist. Apply to a functional context such as in sit-to-stand and TUG test. Strengthening trunk extensors to reduce thoracic kyphosis, as well as improving posture, may prevent vertebral fractures(14) -Patients should progress to a program of strength training 2\u20133 times per week at 70\u201390%  of one repetition maximum (1-RM),  2\u20133 sets of 8\u201310 repetitions, as appropriate and tolerated \u2013Include stretching exercises, especially for tight hip flexor and plantar flexor muscles (14) \u2013Include balance retraining exercises, such as functional activities in standing and walking (e.g., reaching in multiple directions and responding to perturbations; walking with turns, over obstacles, on uneven surfaces, and at varied speeds)(14) \u2013Include gait/ambulatory retraining exercises, such as focusing on foot clearance, use of appropriate assistive devices, and safety; distance walking to develop cardiorespiratory endurance(14) \u2013Padded hip protectors may be indicated in high-risk  cases, such as in long-term  care settings",
            "Exercise programs \u2013Exercise and Sports Science Australia (ESSA) published guidelines in 2017 for safe and effective exercise for bone health(46) -Some important concepts: -Although walking is beneficial, in isolation it is not sufficient to optimize bone health -Exercise prescription for the prevention of osteoporosis should begin in childhood -In order for exercise to improve bone health, it must: -be dynamic, not static -induce relatively high bone strains -be applied rapidly -Relatively few loading cycles are required,short bouts followed by rest are more effective, and diversification of loading is necessary -Recommendation is for a minimum of 2 weekly sessions of progressive resistance training (PRT), 4\u20137 weekly sessions of impact activities, and balance training -An exercise program should take into account an individual\u2019s BMD and functional and clinical risk factors for falls and fracture (e.g., age, history of falls, balance, vision) -Guidelines based on risk of low-trauma  fracture: -Low-risk  individuals (normal BMD and functional status, no clinical risk factors for falls or fracture [e.g., children, adolescents, healthy adults]): the goal is to maximize bone mass and strength.The recommendation includes progressively increasing impact activities including jumps, hops, and multi-directional  weight-bearing activities, recreational sporting activities, high-intensity  PRT, and balance training -Moderate risk individuals (T-score  \u20131.0 to \u20132.5,  and some clinical or functional risk factors for fracture): the goal is to preserve or improve bone mass and strength, and improve muscle strength, power, and balance. The recommendation is similar to that for low-risk  individuals, but for individuals approaching a T-score  of \u20132.5 more moderate impact activities may be appropriate (e.g., running, jumping rope, racket sports). Activities that challenge balance, posture, and mobility should be a greater focus than for low-risk  individuals -High-risk  individuals (T-score  less than \u20132.5, previous fracture and/or multiple risk factors for fracture): Recommendation is for moderate-impact activities within limits of pain and increasing as tolerated, high-intensity  PRT, and balance, posture, coordination, and mobility exercises.
