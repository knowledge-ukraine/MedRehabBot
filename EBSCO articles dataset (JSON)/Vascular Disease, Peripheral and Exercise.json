            "Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a disease in which occlusive atherosclerotic lesions develop in the extremities, and is a manifestation of a systemic atherosclerotic process(19)",
            "Arterial stenosis causes inadequate blood flow in distal limbs and results in the failure to meet metabolic demands during exertion(17)",
            "In the lower extremities (LE), lesions tend to occur in three anatomic segments: the aortoiliac segment, femoral-popliteal segment, and the infrapopliteal or tibial segment of the arterial tree(19)",
            "Patients with PAD should receive a program ofstructured exercise and lifestyle modification, as it reduces cardiovascular ischemic events and improves functional status(16)",
            "Supervised treadmill exercise is recommended as the first line of therapy for walking impairment in PAD(25)",
            "Research has shown that exercise is important in treating PAD because it leads to decreased leg pain and improvement in general physical condition, but itsinfluence onQOL is not as clear,(4) although authors of a 2017 review stated that QOL is improved with exercise(26)",
            "The 2016 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelinesstate that research is needed to identify the best community-or  home-based  exercise programs for patients with PAD to maximize functional status and improve QOL. Also, there a need to investigate the role of such exercise programs before or in addition to revascularization(16)",
            "Relevant definitions \u2013Claudication -Pain in the calf of one or both legs that occurs during walking and is relieved only by rest(4) \u2013Acute arterial occlusion of a limb(16,19) -Rapid or sudden decrease in limb perfusion that threatens tissue viability -Might be due to an embolus or to thrombosis of a diseased atherosclerotic segment -Symptoms include pain, paralysis, pulselessness, mottling, and pallor  -Vascular emergency; immediate revascularization is required within 3 hours; by 6 hours, irreversible tissue damage is guaranteed \u2013Critical limb ischemia(16,19) -Defined by most vascular clinicians as lower extremity chronic ischemic rest pain, ulceration, or gangrene attributable to arterial occlusive disease -Chronic resting perfusion defect leads to the inability to adequately supply blood to sustain viability of the extremity -Bypass grafting is the primary technique of revascularization -Associated with the highest rate of amputation \u2013Intermittent claudication (IC): transient leg pain due to poor circulation",
            "Patients with PAD often report the onset of IC typically in the calf muscles first and during physical activity(19)",
            "Claudication pain promotes sedentary behavior and thus decreases physical functioning in ADLs as well as activity-related QOL(27)",
            "Diagnostic ultrasound measurement of the ankle-brachial  index (ABI) is the most often used clinical tool to assess PAD severity. ABI is assessed by obtaining BP at the ankle (dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arteries) and both brachial arteries while patient is supine and limb is at same position as heart. The higher of the two ankle pressures is then divided by the higher of the two brachial pressures to determine the ABI(17,18)",
            "ABI \u2265 1.40 \u2013 noncompressible calcified vessel \u2013 can try toe-brachial index instead",

            "Leg segmental pressures can also be done to determine where occlusion is \u2013 a drop of 20mm Hg is considered significant",
            "Exercise training has been found to improve cardiorespiratory fitness, pain-free  and total flat-ground  walking distance, and graded treadmill performance in patients with PAD.(25) This Clinical Review  highlights the prominent role of supervised exercise therapy for the medical management of lower-extremity  PAD in patients with IC",
