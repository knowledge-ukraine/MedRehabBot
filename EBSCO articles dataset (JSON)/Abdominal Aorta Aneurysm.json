            "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an abnormal dilation in the arterial wall that arises below the thorax, usually (95% of the time) below branches of the renal arteries(1,2,3)",
            "In general,AAAs are identified on diagnostic ultrasound screening as an infrarenal aortic diameter equal to or greater than 50% of the normal diameter for sex and age. The predominance of AAAs are found in men. AAAs with a diameter 30 to 55 mm are considered small(1,2)",
            "Authors of a consecutive series of 10,403 men and women screened by transthoracic ultrasound in New Zealand, found that the age-related prevalence of AAA increased from about 1% of men and women ages 60-64  years to 9% of men and 5% of women older than age 80(18)",
            "Like other aortic aneurysms, the risk of AAA rupture increases with diameter size. Most AAAs do not produce specific symptoms until impending leakage or sudden rupture(1,2)",
            "Medical management of asymptomatic patients with a small AAA involves periodic surveillance imaging of diameter growth rate and pharmaceutical intervention similar to peripheral artery disease, as indicated. Elective surgical repair is usually recommended when the diameter is considered large; that is, 55 mm in men and 50\u2009mm in women.(3,4)Prevention of rupture is the main indication for either open surgical repair (OSR) or endovascular aneurysm repair (EV AR) of a large AAA",
            "AAA is an asymptomatic condition. However, patients are at risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and do require increased caution for CVD symptoms. The chief concern in patients with a small AAA is to maintain regular activities of daily living (ADLs),promote health-related  physical fitness, and encourage periodic ultrasound surveillance(1,5)",
            "Prophylactic prescribed aerobic exercise for patients awaiting elective AAA surgical repair may favorably reduce post-operative complications and improve survival at 3-years  follow-up(5,6,7,8)",
            "Supervised exercise training may provide clinical benefits without complications in selected patients with a small AAA(9,10)"
