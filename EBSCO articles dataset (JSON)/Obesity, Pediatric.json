During interval training, participants were divided into four groups (based on results of VO2 peak test) to individualize intensity  -The nontrained group were asked to continue with \u201cusual\u201d activity (i.e., no regular physical activity, no drug consumption, no addition of dietary supplementation) -Significant improvements were seen in the trained group in body composition (percentage of fat-free mass, percentage of fat mass, and hip circumference) and measures of lipid peroxidation and/or inflammation",
            "Resistance training \u2013Authors of a 2018 meta-analysis  concluded that an isolated resistance training program may provide positive effects on weight status for young children and adolescents(31) -Based on 7 databases searched between May 2016 and June 2017 -Studies were included that examined the effects of resistance training for school aged children from 5 to 18 years old \u2013Resistance training can improve endothelial function, hemodynamic and metabolic profiles, body composition, and physical fitness in obese adolescents(32) -Based on an RCT involving 44 subjects, of whom 20 were in the non-obese  group (control group) and 24 were in the obese group (experimental group) -Resistance training program consisted of 1 to 3 sets of exercises focusing on the major muscle groups performed in the following order: chest and leg press, low row, leg extension, seated bilateral cable row, leg and arm curls, leg adduction, triceps extension, leg abduction, plantarflexion, and push-ups -A circuit training program was performed without rest interval between sets -Subjects participated in a total of 36 30\u201340-minute sessions in a 12-week  period",
            "Aerobic and resistance training \u2013Twenty-two  weeks of aerobic, resistance, or combined training reduced total body fat (measured by MRI) and waist circumference in obese adolescents, with combined training causing greater decreases than aerobic or resistance training alone in adolescents who were adherent (> 70%) to program(15) -Based on an RCT conducted in Canada involving 304 participants with BMI at or above 95th percentile for age and sex -Four groups (control, aerobic only, resistance only, combined training) were compared, with the exercising groups working out 4 times weekly \u2013The addition of resistance training to an aerobic training program improved bone mineral content, adiponectin concentration (an anti-inflammatory  marker), and lean body mass in adolescents(16) -Based on a study of 42 postpubertal adolescents (14\u201318  years with BMI > 30) that was conducted in Brazil -Participants in the aerobic group did 60 minutes of treadmill running, while the aerobic plus resistance group did 30 minutes of bicycle or treadmill and 30 minutes of strength training. Both groups met 3 times a week for one year",
            "Authors of a 2017 systematic review conducted in Taiwan concluded that participation in a 6-month  lifestyle modification may reduce fasting plasma glucose in overweight/ obese children(21) \u2013Six databases were searched in this study \u20133,923 obese/overweight children from 8 RCTs were included in this study",
            "Authors of a 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis  concluded that participation in group sporting activities is positively correlatedwith improvements in body composition, cardiorespiratory endurance, and hand grip strength in overweight/obese children. However, no improvements in flexibility or neuromotor fitness were seen with participation in group sports(26) .
