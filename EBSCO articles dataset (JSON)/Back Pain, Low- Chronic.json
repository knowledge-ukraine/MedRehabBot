            "Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is characterized by musculoskeletal pain, tenderness, and restricted mobility in the lumbosacral area for more than 3 months. CLBP is a leading cause of disability, work absenteeism, and reduced health-related  quality of life (HRQOL).(18)Psychological factors may also impact disability and HRQOL in patients with CLBP(2)",
            "CLBP may initially be treated conservatively which includes over the counter pain medication; modalities such as rest, ice, and heat. Physical therapy and core strengthening exercises may also be prescribed(18)",
            "Strong evidence from RCTs supports appropriate therapeutic exercise and/or functional activities, patient education to continue ADLs as tolerated, and promotion of active self-management  in adults with CLBP. Programs that use aerobic training, strengthening, stretching/flexibility, trunk stabilization, or specific back exercises (that address normalizing lumbosacral movement) may each help reduce pain and disability in patients with CLBP(3)"
