            "Swallowing/feeding therapy \u2013Positioning/postural adaptations: Individuals with KS who have abnormalities in posture, tone, and/or movement that influence feeding may benefit from changes in position. In these cases, the SLP can collaborate with a PT and/or OT to determine a position that optimizes swallow function -Feeding infants with KS who have GER in an upright position might improve intake(1) -For detailed information on postural changes as dysphagia treatment, see Clinical Review\u2026 Dysphagia: Swallowing Therapy \u2013Compensatory ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T709081 \u2013Adaptive equipment: Adaptive equipment for eating and feeding therapy will depend on the individual\u2019s age and might include specific nipples, bottles, pacifiers, cups, spoons, and forks. The SLP can collaborate with the OT in selecting adaptive equipment for feeding  \u2013Modification of liquids: Liquids can be modified (e.g., thickened) to assist the patient with controlling liquids in the oral and pharyngeal phases of the swallow and improve the effectiveness and safety of the swallow. Trials of different liquid consistencies should be performed with instrumental assessments (e.g., VFSS, FEES) to determine safety. Modification of equipment such as bottles and cups might be necessary in order to accommodate the thickened liquids, and parents/ caregivers should receive training and information regarding thickened liquids. Examples of circumstances in which thickened liquids can assist the patient include: -Pooling of liquid in the oral cavity(19) -Poor lip closure and loss of liquid(19) -Poor tongue control, movement, and coordination(19) -Delayed initiation of the swallow(19) -Coughing/choking/gulping(19) -Clinical signs of aspiration(19) -Presence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)(1,19) -For detailed information on modification of liquids as dysphagia treatment, see  Clinical Review\u2026 Dysphagia: Swallowing Therapy \u2013Compensatory , referenced above \u2013Modification of solid foods: Solid foods can be modified to assist the patient with chewing and forming/controlling the bolus. In addition, recommendations of food consistency and food type must be aligned to the family\u2019s dietary habits and culture. The following guidelines are indicators of age of nutritional readiness and oral skills for solid foods in individuals with typical development; however, for an individual with KS, his or her oromotor/feeding skills and food allergies must be considered when introducing new textures of foods: -6 to 8 months \u2013 purees(19) -8 to 9 months \u2013 mashed lumpy/mixed textures(19) -Finger food -7 to 8 months onwards \u2013 toast/biscuits(19) -10 to 11 months onwards \u2013 soft chopped food(19) -10 to 12 months onwards \u2013 firm finger foods(19) -15 months onwards \u2013 foods that require sustained biting and chewing(19) -For detailed information on modification of solid foods as dysphagia treatment, see Clinical Review\u2026 Dysphagia: Swallowing Therapy \u2013Compensatory , referenced above \u2013Feeding tubes (orogastric, nasogastric, gastronomy, jejunostomy)/enteral feeding: Decisions regarding the use of feeding tubes should be made with input from the SLP, physician, nutritionist, and other rehabilitation professionals who have professional experience and training. Individuals with KS who have shown signs of malnutrition, aspiration, insufficient fluid intake, or excessive stress during mealtimes might be candidates for a feeding tube to provide an alternative nutritional source(1)",
