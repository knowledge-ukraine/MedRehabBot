Long-term  use (> 3 years) can have detrimental vision side effects(31) Tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline)(1) Antihistamines (e.g., hydroxyzine,cimetidine)(1) Patients taking hydroxyzine have demonstrated up to 90% reduction in IC symptoms and patients taking cimetidine up to 57% reduction in IC symptoms(31) Neuroleptics (e.g., gabapentin, topiramate)(1) Antimuscarinics(1) Oral prednisone is prescribed for patients with Hunner\u2019sulcers(1) Intravesical therapy (medication placed directly into the bladder via catheter) is sometimes used as long-term  therapy if oral medications are not effective, for acute flareups,  or before oral medications reach their maximum benefit(1,3)  Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is the only FDA-approved  intravesical treatment for IC; however, other medications are sometimes used (such as heparin)(1,3) Authors of a meta-analysis  that included 3 studies with data from 213 patients total reported that intravesical 2% chondroitin sulphate was an effective therapy for some patients with IC(23) DMSO is associated with side effects such as a garlic-like  odor or taste on the breath or skin that lasts up to 72 hours after a treatment(1) Sildenafil (Viagra, Revatio), a vasodilator, provides relief from urinary urgency and pain(27) Based on a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled  trial in China that included 48 women with IC Authors of a review (81 RCTs and 4674 patients) examined different treatment options for IC. Of 65 differentantidepressants, pentosan polysulfate, and neuromuscular blockade(38) Because the evidence was rated of very low quality, not many conclusions were drawn.
