            "sEMG is utilized in dysphagia rehabilitation to facilitate biofeedback.(1) Biofeedback refers to the use of equipment (usually electronic equipment) to quantify reflexive body functions such as swallowing.(1,2) The measurements obtained using sEMG equipment can then be displayed as a visual representation or heard as an auditory signal that patients learn to manipulate by consciously controlling specific body functions (in this case, swallowing).(1,2) With respect to dysphagia treatment, sEMG biofeedback allows patients to visualize the electrical activity of their swallowing muscles(1)",
            "The rationale for sEMG biofeedback is that if a person can use a visual and/or auditory signal that represents muscle activity, rather than just feel the muscles contract, he or she will be able to contract the muscles more effectively and retrain them more quickly than without the use of the sEMG biofeedback(2) \u2013Swallowing is an involuntary function of which patients are generally unaware; biofeedback converts this function into something concrete that patients can then consciously monitor and alter(3)",

Patients underwent 10 daily sessions of dysphagia therapy with sEMG biofeedback over the course of 2 weeks. In the sessions, the focus was on increasing the precision in muscle contraction during swallowing using visual feedback. The patients each had a submental surface electrode in place that delivered visual feedback onto a computer monitor screen; there was a green square on the screen and the goal was to get the amplitude of the curve within the square. At the conclusion of the intervention period and 2 weeks postintervention, baseline measures were repeated and included the timed water swallow test, Test of Mastication and Swallowing Solids, sEMG of submental muscles, and swallowing-related quality of life questionnaire (SWAL-QOL).Immediately postintervention, the swallowing rate for liquids, the sEMG durational parameters of premotor time, and swallowing-related quality of life improved, but not by a statistically significant amount. Preswallow time significantly improved. These improvements were retained at the 2-week  postintervention follow-up session(28) In a study conducted in the United States, researchers compared performance of 27 subjects with Parkinson disease and 24 age-matched healthy controls on a visuomotor tracking task controlled by sEMG to assess the utility of sEMG for biofeedback in dysphagia therapy. Both groups were asked to produce saliva swallows and complete a visuomotor tracking task utilizing both static and dynamic targets, with surface electrodes recording muscle activity of the anterior neck and submental surface during both tasks. There were no significant differences in visuomotor tracking ability between controls and participants with Parkinson disease. Data analysis of sEMG indicated that the participants with Parkinson disease showed a trend for decreased swallow durations at the anterior neck, but controls showed a trend for increased durations at the anterior neck. Additionally, there was no relationship between tracking ability and swallowing behavior and researchers reported that, based on these data, there was limited promise for sEMG biofeedback for patients with dysphagia as a result of Parkinson disease(29) Authors of a case study in the United States examined use of sEMG biofeedback for dysphagia therapy in a 40-year-old female patient who had a history of recurrent oral and lymphatic carcinoma(3) \u2013Patient had undergone several surgical resections of the neck, tongue, and parts of the face as well as radiation therapy to the face, tongue, and neck(3) -Evaluation of speech and swallowing function revealed severe to profound dysarthria and dysphagia(3) -Aspiration as well as a delay of the pharyngeal swallow response and pooling to the valleculae and pyriform sinuses were observed on a modified MBS study(3) \u2013sEMG biofeedback was utilized as an adjunct to the patient\u2019s dysphagia therapy(3) -The patient was treated for 10 weeks; biofeedback was introduced in week 2 of her program(3) -Electrodes were placed vertically under the patient\u2019s chin to record the collective electrical output from the suprahyoid muscles(3) -Patient was trained to perform the effortful swallow and Mendelsohn maneuvers(3) -Both maneuvers were taught and trained with sEMG biofeedback monitoring in place(3) -Visual signals of the patient\u2019s swallows were displayed on a monitor for her to see and manipulate(3) -The SLP cued patient to adjust her muscle contractions and shape the visual signals to more closely match a target signal(3) \u2013In addition to the effortful swallow and Mendelsohn maneuvers, the SLP also taught the patient vocal fold adduction exercises and chin tuck and performed thermal stimulation as part of her swallow therapy program(3) \u2013In week 2, the patient was also instructed to use the exercises and strategies learned in therapy at home, without sEMG biofeedback(3) \u2013After therapy, an MBS study was repeated, which revealed resolution of the patient\u2019s dysphagia(3) -It was recommended that the patient return to a full oral diet and her supplemental tube feedings were discontinued(3) sEMG can be used to determine if the patient is activating the desired target muscle(s) during laryngeal/pharyngeal strengthening exercises and to what extent they are being contracted. In a nontreatment study conducted in the United States, a researcher used sEMG to compare muscle activation in healthy female subjects without dysphagia in two different swallowing exercises. The two exercises investigated were an isometric jaw opening to resistance chin-to-chest  exercise and an isometric head-lifting  exercise (similar to the Shaker exercise). Subjects had sEMG electrodes placed on their submental skin behind the mandible. The researcher was targeting the hyolaryngeal muscles and compared the amount of  activation elicited from each exercise. sEMG measurements revealed significantly more activation of the submandibular hyolaryngeal muscles during the chin-to-chest  exercise versus the head-lifting exercise(27) See Description, Indications of procedure,  and Guidelines for use of procedure,  above .
