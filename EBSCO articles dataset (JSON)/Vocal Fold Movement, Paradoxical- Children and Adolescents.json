In addition, the laryngeal examination serves to determine the position of the larynx (e.g., high, low) and any other characteristics of the vocal folds, including vocal fold closure and physical aspects of the folds (e.g., swollen, tense). The patient should be referred for a follow-up  biopsy if a growth is identified. Laryngeal examinations involve anyA mirror examination involves placing a mirror in the back of the patient\u2019s throat. V ocal folds can be visualized by reflecting light down to the voice box(11)Rigid endoscopy is performed with a rigid tube placed into the oral or pharyngeal cavity. A rigid laryngoscope provides the clearest view of the larynx; however, the tongue needs to be held by the examiner, and normal speech production cannot be performed during the examination. A flexible laryngoscope uses fiberoptic technology and can be passed through the nose to the back of the throat, allowing for examination of the larynx during voicing. Flexible laryngoscopes might be better tolerated by children and adolescents who have sensitive gag reflexes.(12) When the patient is symptomatic, PVFM typically appears as adduction (closing) of the anterior two thirds of the vocal cords with a slight posterior opening in the form of a diamond shape.(5) Medialization of the ventricular folds might also occur.(1) When the patient is asymptomatic, laryngeal structure and function appear to be normal with laryngoscopy(1)Videostroboscopic examination allows the examiner to see the vocal folds vibrating in slow motion and gives information on any abnormalities present during voice production (e.g., abnormal closure). It is performed with instrumentation used for oral endoscopy or nasendoscopy and is combined with a strobe light correlated to vocal fold vibration(12)Electroglottography is a system to provide information on vocal fold closure by measuring the electrical resistance of two electrodes placed around the neck(12) A handheld tool that can be used to measure respiratory resistance over time; provides an objective measure of changes in inspiratory and expiratory respiratory resistance that result from PVFM(30)The SLP should get information regarding the onset of PVFM, possible triggers of PVFM, nature of the breathing difficulty, any previous respiratory disease or difficulties, patient\u2019s regular vocal activities (e.g., singing, yelling during sports), and recent voice changes. The SLP can informally evaluate the patient\u2019s vocal quality, muscle tension, and breathing patterns during an interview. A family member or parent/caregiver can be included in the interview as needed(13)Identify the voice\u2019s perceptual and acoustic characteristics with perceptual and instrumental measures if the patient exhibits any dysphonia. Observe the patient\u2019s behavior (e.g., evidence of neck strain) during voicing or voicing attempts(10) -Acoustic measures of voice might include signal-to-noise  ratio, jitter (pitch perturbation), and shimmer (amplitude perturbation). Computerized voice analysis programs such as the Multi-Dimension V oice Program (MDVP) allow the clinician to calculate these voice parameters and compare the patient\u2019s results to normative data provided in the programThe patient is asked to take a deep breath and sustain the vowel /a/ for as long as(14)3-11 seconds5-15 seconds5-16 seconds5-20 secondsNumber of syllables or words produced on one expiratory flowThe length of time a patient can produce \u201cS\u201d over the length of time the patient can produce \u201cZ.\u201d A number greater than 1.4 indicates difficulty with movement of the vocal folds. Normal value is 1Low to high and high to low. Listen for pitch breaks, reduced range, tension, and cessation of voicingDuring tasks such as counting and reading passages, the examiner can assess -Are the inhalations stridulous (high-pitched and noisy)? -Is air released prior to phonation? -Does the patient have shortness of breath? -Does the patient\u2019s vocal quality change as the breath diminishes at the end of exhalation? -Is the voice weak or breathy? -Is the patient\u2019s voicing effortful or forced?Observe patient for any muscle tension in the neck, jaw, shoulders, face, or lipsObserve patient's breath support during sustained phonation, at rest, and during conversationThe Consensus Auditory-Perceptual  Evaluation of V oice (CAPE-V)  is available on the//www.asha.org/uploadedFiles/members/divs/ D3CAPEVprocedures.pdf ) and can be used to systematically describe the severity of auditory-perceptual  characteristics of the voice. The results can be considered with those of other instrumental measures to contribute to hypotheses regarding the anatomic and physiological bases of voice problems. The patient is asked to produce sustained vowels, overall severity, roughness, breathiness, strain, pitch, and loudness(15)Research has indicated that voice disorders in children and adolescents can lead to negative attention from peers and/or teachers and reduced participation in school and social activities.(17)Quality of life measures have been found to reflect significant impairment in social-emotional and physical-functional  domains for children and adolescents with voice disorders(18)A 10-item  pediatric voice outcomes instrument(19)A 23-item outcome measure based on the adult VHI(20)A quality of life instrument validated for adults with breathing disorders; authors of a study conducted in the United States with 56 children and adolescents (ages 12 to 18) who had the diagnosis of exercise-induced  PVFM reported that the DI was valid and reliable for assessing quality of life in this population as well(16) ",

In addition, the SLP might be involved in diagnostic input, patient and parent education, supportive counseling, and voice therapy(1) \u2013Therapy for PVFM is called laryngeal control therapy; laryngeal control therapy involves teaching the patient to use diaphragmatic breathing to decrease throat tension and promote passive inspiration.(26) Additionally, the patient is taught to relax the upper body, especially the neck, during speech and at rest and is educated about the use of vocal hygiene measures (e.g., adequate water intake, eliminating of throat clearing and shouting)(26) -Laryngeal control breathing techniques (LCBTs) focus on having the patient use noisy nasal inhalation with lips tightly closed followed by noisy exhalation through pursed lips. These techniques are combined with diaphragmatic breathing to increase efficiency and control(28) -Initial therapy sessions should focus on performing and perfecting LCBTs in isolation and then move on to functional situations that are known to trigger episodes(28) \u2013In a retrospective chart review study conducted in the United States that included104 patients (adolescents and adults) with symptoms of PVFM that were exercise-related  only, researchers found that laryngeal control therapy was effective in managing these symptoms.(26) Sixty-seven  of the patients identified to have exercise-induced  PVFM enrolled in laryngeal control therapy, and of these 48 (72%) exhibited improvement in or complete resolution of symptoms related to exercise-induced PVFM(26)",

In total, there were 420 individuals included in the studies, ranging in age from 8 years to 87 years; 32 of the studies reviewed included children.(21) Authors of this review concluded that, although the evidence for speech therapy for the treatment of PVFM  was promising, additional, well-controlled  studies are needed.

The following are case studies and clinical reports that have described the effects of treatment: \u2013Biofeedback training:  A 16-year-old  girl with PVFM received surface electromyography (EMG) biofeedback training once a week over the course of 10 weeks. During biofeedback sessions, EMG surface electrodes were placed along a parallel axis of the thyrohyoid membrane, using the thyroid cartilage as an anatomical marker.(24) The girl was asked to try to relax and lower her observed muscle tension below a preset criterion. No instructions were given on how to accomplish the relaxation other than \"try to relax the muscle tension near your vocal cords to below the criterion line on the computer screen, using the feedback to guide you.\" A new criterion level was set after the current criterion was met in three consecutive sessions. Baseline muscle tension levels decreased over 60%, with reductions in episodes of respiratory distress and chest pain. The girl and girl's family reported overall improvement in school attendance and adaptive functioning(24)  \u2013Instruction in deep breathing: The authors of a clinical report described a 15-year-old  female competitive swimmer who had a 3-week  history of shortness of breath and a wheezy, irregular breathing pattern while swimming. The patient also described a \"blockage\" in the throat.(3) During a flexible fiberoptic examination of the larynx, signs of irritation due to LPR were observed. These included swollen, red arytenoids and swelling of the lower edges of the vocal folds. The patient was asked to reproduce the blockage and wheezy feeling during inhalation. With the endoscope in place, the patient was asked to perform breathing exercises to maintain vocal fold abduction. She could then visualize how a deep nasal sniff during inspiration could abduct the vocal folds. She learned to coordinate this deep breathing in the pool by slowing her pace, and she also practiced this technique at home. Additionally, she was given behavioral techniques to reduce LPR. Complete resolution of her symptoms occurred after 2 weeks . Problem Goal Intervention Expected Progression Home Program PVFM The patient and patient's family will better understand the nature of PVFM and respirationPatient and family education about respiration _ The SLP might briefly educate the child and family about respiratory and laryngeal structures, the process of respiration, and the function of the larynx(1)The child and child's family will better understand PVFM and respiratory and laryngeal functionN/A PVFM The child and family might identify emotional triggers and reactions to PVFMSupportive counseling _ The SLP should discuss and acknowledge the patient\u2019s and family's fears regarding respiratory symptoms during a PVFM attack. The SLP might also discuss emotional issues and possible triggers of PVFM with the patient and family.(1) Refer to a psychologist if there are serious underlying issues that need to be addressed more fully(3)The patient and patient's family will identify emotional reactions that trigger and follow PVFM attacks so that the patient can use therapy techniques during optimal timesN/A  PVFM The patient will identify and control excess muscle tension in the larynx, face, and respiratory musculatureInstruction in tension identification and control _ The SLP guides the patient in tightening relevant muscles, noticing the feeling of tightness and then the feeling of relaxation when letting go of muscles(1)The patient learns to tighten and relax muscles in groups: eye and brow area, jaw area, lips, tongue, shoulders, inhalatory muscles, and abdominal areaN/A PVFM The patient will learn relaxed throat breathing to reduce laryngeal muscle tension during PVFM attachesInstruction in relaxed throat breathing _",
            "Instruct the patient to breathe in through the nose with the tongue resting on floor of mouth and the lips gently held together. Have the patient inhale while feeling the expansion of the lower ribcage and abdominal area (e.g., patient places hands on either side of lower ribcage with thumbs pointing backwards)",
            "Instruct the patient to let the air out slowly and gently with a hissing sound or prolonged \"s.\" The SLP can count out loud to facilitate the exhaling to lung volume around resting exhalatory level(1)The patient should first practice throat breathing in relaxed situations and gradually progress to more challenging situations that might trigger PVFM (e.g., increase the level of physical activity before the exercise)The patient should practice relaxed throat breathing at home once it is mastered in the therapy setting  PVFM triggered by laryngopharyngeal reflux caused by GERDPatient will control reflux and reduce reflux symptomsBehavioral methods for controlling GERD _",
