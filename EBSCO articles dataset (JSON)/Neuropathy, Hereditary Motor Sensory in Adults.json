See Pathogenesis , below-It is characterized by distal weakness, decreased nerve conduction velocities, and decreased deep tendon reflexes(9)-Type I is classified as a demyelinating form of CMT disease, caused by a myelin defect(8)-Many subtypes of Type I exist (i.e., CMT disease Type IA, IB, IC, ID, IF, and IX)(7)-Type IA is the most common form, accounting for 36% of all cases of CMT disease and 55% of genetically definedcases(29)-CMT disease Type IX is the second most common form of CMT disease and involves a gene mutation on the Xchromosome. It affects males more severely than females, and accounts for at least 10% of all patients with CMTdisease(29)\u2013CMT disease Type II-Type II is a mild form, with less weakness and nerve involvement, and is a primary axonopathy; it is the axonal form ofCMT disease(3,9)-Accounts for 20% of all cases of CMT disease(29)-Researchers who conducted a genetic study in Germany of 73 individuals with CMT disease Type II reported that 6 ofthe individuals tested had mutations in the mitofusin 2 ( MFN2 ) gene(10)-Many subtypes exist (i.e., CMT disease Type IIA, IIB, IIC, IID, IIE, IIF, IIG, and IIL)(7,11)\u2013CMT disease Type III-Also known as Dejerine-Sottas  syndrome or Dejerine-Sottas  phenotype, this is a rare demyelinating form of CMTdisease in which symptoms begin during infancy(1,7,28)-Characterized by severe \u201chypertrophic\u201d demyelination(3)\u2013CMT disease Type IV(7,30)-A rare demyelinating form of CMT disease that is autosomal recessive.

The difference between thetwo types is that HNPP involves a deletion on the gene site rather than a duplication error as in Type I-Patients with this type of CMT disease have only transient episodes of neurologic impairments that can last from hoursto years.

Inaddition, each parent has only a 25% chance of passing the mutated gene to offspring-CMT disease develops only in individuals with both copies of the recessive genes, so parents with only one copy of thedefective gene will have no symptoms-All CMT disease type IVs are autosomal recessive and are the least common forms of CMT disease\u2013X-linked  inheritance-This inheritance pattern involves a gene mutation responsible for CMT disease that is carried on the female sexchromosome.
