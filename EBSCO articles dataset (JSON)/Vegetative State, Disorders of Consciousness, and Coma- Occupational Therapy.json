            "Unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) \u2013Typically follows coma(2) \u2013The three main clinical features are:(29) -cycles of eye opening -complete lack of awareness of self or environment -complete or partial preservation of hypothalamic and brainstem autonomic functions \u2013As with a coma, a patient in a UWS does not show evidence of purposeful movement in response to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli(15) \u2013Previously this state was referred to as a vegetative state. However, in 2010 Laureys et al. proposed a change in the terminology to unresponsive wakefulness syndrome because vegetative state was considered pejorative. The European Task Force on Disorders of Consciousness then passed a proposal to implement the change. Most literature published since then uses the term UWS(17)",
            "Minimally conscious state (MCS) \u2013A significantly altered state of consciousness distinct from coma and UWS due to presence of episodes of consciousness in which eye contact or goal-directed  behavior occurs(2) \u2013Individuals in an MCS demonstrate inconsistent periods of consciousness with some degree of functional recovery and responsive behavior(1) \u2013Behavioral responses of individuals in an MCS indicate some level of self-awareness(41) \u2013Emergence from MCS is marked by recovery of interactive communication or functional object use(16) ",

The evidence reviewed indicated some positive outcomes for multisensory stimulation, music therapy, contingent stimulation, and assistive technology; however, the quality of the evidence was not high enough to establish treatment efficacy(20)",
            "Authors of a systematic review of studies conducted between 2003 and 2013 on the effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions for persons with disordered consciousness identified 12 interventions (including nutrition, tracheostomy care, mobility management, and multimodal sensory stimulation) and found insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of multimodal sensory stimulation(24)",

The evidence supported the use of early, frequent, multimodal sensory stimulation that is individually tailored to each patient for improving alertness and arousal in patients with coma and UWS(23) \u2013Authors of a study examined whether preferred music has effects on functional connectivity within resting state networks related to consciousness. Thirteen patients with UWS were compared to 18 healthy controls(37) -Functional connectivity was analyzed following exposure of the patients to three auditory stimuli (scanner noise, preferred music, and aversive auditory stimulation) -Functional connectivity did not vary in the three conditions in healthy controls, but was impaired in all three conditions in patients with UWS -Preferred music and aversive stimulation increased the functional connectivity of the auditory network -The authors concluded that sensory stimulation programs should consider the need for strong stimuli (preferred music and/or aversive auditory stimuli) to elicit cerebral responses \u2013Researchers in South Korea compared the effects of direct vs non-direct  auditory stimulation on arousal in coma patients with severe TBI(28) -A crossover intervention study design with 9 participants was used -Direct auditory stimulation involves stimuli such as voices of family members, orientation by a nurse, and familiar music, and it requires a higher level of interpersonal interaction between the patient and the stimuli. Non-direct  auditory stimuli were more general, less familiar, less interactive, and not lively, such as general music and TV sounds -Participants received both direct and non-direct auditory stimulation in randomized order for 15 minutes -Outcome measures were the GCS and the SSAM -Both direct and non-direct  auditory stimulation resulted in significantly increased GCS and SSAM scores over baseline. The improvement in SSAM scores after direct auditory stimulation was significantly greater than that after non-direct auditory stimulation, but there was no statistically significant difference in GCS scores -The authors concluded that direct and non-direct auditory stimulation may be beneficial for increasing the arousal of comatose patients and that the SSAM is more useful for detecting subtle changes from stimulation intervention than the GCS  \u2013Authors of an RCT (N = 50) evaluated the effectiveness of a tilt table therapy with or without an integrated stepping device on the level of consciousness in patients with UWS or MCS. Both groups received 10 1-hour  verticalization treatments over the course of 3 weeks(39) -Both groups improved significantly on the CRS-R score during the intervention phase and maintained this gain during the follow-up  period -When comparing the changes in the CRS-R  score in the first three weeks and at six weeks, the group receiving therapy on a tilt table without an integrated stepping device group was statistically superior to the group receiving therapy on a tilt table therapy with an integrated stepping device -The group receiving therapy on a tilt table therapy with an integrated stepping device did not have any additional benefit for patients with disorders of consciousness.
