            "It is widely believed that plicae arise from mesenchyme (embryonic connective tissue) during embryologic developmentof the knee at 3\u20134 months of fetal life.(4)The mesenchyme forms the membranes that eventually divide the differentcompartments of the knee. Plicae are composed of excess tissue from these membranes that failed to be reabsorbed andeventually become inward folds of the synovial lining(4,5)",
            "Plicae commonly are asymptomatic and have been reported to be present in 50% of the population. Unfortunately, theirpresence can also lead to an inflammatory state or hypertrophic fibrosis if trauma or repetitive activity is introduced,respectively",
            "Repetitive plica inflammation probably leads to the hypertrophic fibrosis, with proliferation of nerves and blood vessels.This progression results in an enlarged medial plica that is less elastic and can either become impinged between the medialfemoral condyle and the medial facet of the patella during knee flexion or create a shearing force over the medial femoralcondyle(5)",
            "Close proximity of the plica under the VMO muscle may cause pain and associated patellar tracking disorders. Fibroticchanges of the plica can lead to degeneration and softening of the patellofemoral joint cartilage(5)",
            "The progression has even been postulated to be a cause for medial compartment degeneration, or knee osteoarthritis, asarticular cartilage is sloughed off by the medial plica(5)"
