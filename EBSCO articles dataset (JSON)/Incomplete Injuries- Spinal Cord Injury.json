            "A spinal cord injury (SCI) is any injury to the spinal cord due to trauma or disease, including neoplasm, infection, degeneration, or vascular conditions. The neurological level of the lesion is defined as the most caudalsegment of the spinal cord with normal sensory and motor function(1)",
            "Patients with incomplete SCI have preservation of some sensory and/or motor function below the neurological level, including in the lowest sacral segment(2) \u2013A lack of any sensory or motor function in the lowest sacral segment, including anal sensation or voluntary contraction of the sphincter, is by definition a complete SCI",
            "Tetraplegia is more common than paraplegia and accounts for 52% to 59% of SCIs(1)",
            "Nontraumatic SCIs are generally less severe and almost always incomplete injuries(1)",
            "The incidence of traumatic SCI is approximately 54 cases per million population in the United States (i.e., 17,700 annually), 53 cases per million in Canada, 19 to 24 cases per million in France and Spain, and between 12 to 14 cases per million in the Netherlands, Qatar, Ireland, Finland, and Australia(1)",
            "Based on the degree of motor and sensory loss, the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) classifies SCI into one of 5 categories of severity using the ASIA Impairment Scale (AIS) as follows: \u2013A \u2013 Absence of any sensory or motor function in the sacral segments S4-S5 \u2013B \u2013 Sensation is preserved in S4-S5,  but there is no motor function caudal to the lesion (specifically, caudal to 3 segments below the neurological level) \u2013C \u2013 Sensation is preserved in S4-S5,  but more than half of the key muscles below the lesion have a muscle grade less than 3/5 \u2013D \u2013 Sensation is preserved in S4-S5,  and more than half of the key muscles below the lesion have a muscle grade greater than or equal to 3/5 \u2013E \u2013 Sensory and motor function are normal \u2013A designates a complete lesion. B, C, D, and E designate incomplete lesions  -ASIA E implies that an individual can have a SCI without having any motor or sensory deficits that are detectable on standard neurological examination. Patients categorized as ASIA E may have subtle weakness, spasticity, pain, and/or certain forms of dysesthesia"
