            "Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), is \u201ca serious, chronic, complex, systemic disease that can often profoundly affect the lives of patients\u201d(1)",
            "Marked by profound fatigue, cognitive impairment, sleeping difficulties, autonomic symptoms, and pain which are made worse with any type of exertion(1)",
            "The Institute of Medicine (IOM) released an expert committee report of the evidence base for ME/CFS, the following key facts were identified:(1) \u2013ME/CFS affects 836,000 to 2.5 million Americans -This is likely a very low estimate of prevalence, as it is estimated that in 84\u201391%  of persons with the condition ME/CFS has not been diagnosed \u2013There are five main symptoms of ME/CFS. See \u201cPresentation/signs and symptoms\u201d section for details \u2013The economic burden resulting from loss of productivity in patients with ME/CFS and high medical costs is $17 billion to $24 billion annually in the United States \u2013At least one quarter of ME/CFS patients are bed- or house-bound  at some point during their illness \u2013The IOM recommended that the name \u201csystemic exertion intolerance disease\u201d (SEID) replace both ME/CFS and CFS, as this name reflects the central characteristic of the disease: exertion intolerance with systemic effects -The term chronic fatigue syndrome has been found to negatively affect patients\u2019, as well as others\u2019 (medical personnel, family members, colleagues), perceptions of the illness. It is also felt to trivialize the seriousness of the disease and promote misunderstanding -Myalgic encephalomyelitis is not an appropriate name, as the evidence is lacking to prove that brain inflammation (encephalomyelitis) is part of the disease and also because myalgia is a minor symptom -For the purpose of this Clinical Review, CFS will be referred to as ME/CFS (SEID) \u2013The IOM suggests that many healthcare providers are skeptical about ME/CFS (SEID) and think it is solely a mental health condition. They stress that it is a serious illness that requires timely diagnosis and appropriate care",
            "Prior to the IOM report, the following description of ME/CFS (SEID) was utilized by the CDC:(2,3)  \u2013\u201cA condition characterized by profound mental and physical exhaustion, with at least 6 months\u2019 presence of multiple systemic and neuropsychiatric symptoms, and at least 4 of 8 associated conditions are required: -Impaired memory -Sore throat -Tender lymph nodes -Persistent muscle or joint pain -New headaches -Non-refreshing  sleep -Post-exertional  malaise > 24 hours\u201d",
            "ME/CFS (SEID) occurs mainly in adults,but the CDC reports that 0.2\u20132.3%  of children and adolescents have ME/CFS (SEID)with the prevalence higher in adolescents(4,27)",
            "Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and graded exercise therapy together are the cornerstone of treatment(2,3,5) \u2013CBT should be individualized and focus on challenging fatigue-related  cognitions and planning social and occupational rehabilitation \u2013Graded exercise involves determining what the patient can do without exacerbating symptoms and gradually increasing intensity and duration -Fear of movement and avoidance of physical activity is common in ME/CFS (SEID)",
            "Occupational therapy interventions in the treatment of ME/CFS (SEID) include the following:(6) \u2013CBT \u2013 provided by health professionals (usually either psychologists or occupational therapists [OTs]) who have received training in CBT \u2013Energy conservation techniques \u2013 either focused on the individual or on adapting the task and/or environment. These can also include assistive and adaptive equipment as well as time management, pacing skills, and prioritizing occupations \u2013Consultation -Working with patients to identify alternative and potentially new occupations -Providing referrals to community resources -Education for patient and family on ME/CFS (SEID), as well as strategies for how to self-advocate  given occupational changes"

            "Authors of a Cochrane review examining the effectiveness and acceptability of CBT for ME/CFS (SEID) concluded that CBT was better than usual care and might be better than other psychological therapies. However, there was a lack of evidence when comparing CBT alone or in combination with other treatments(15) \u2013Based on 15 studies involving 1,043 patients with ME/CFS (SEID) \u2013Authors concluded that future studies are required for the development of effective treatment programs",
            "Authors of a Cochrane review examining the effectiveness of GET compared to other interventions for patients with ME/ CFS (SEID) concluded that patients feel less fatigued after exercise therapy. There also appear to be benefits for sleep, physical function, and self-perceived  general health, but no conclusions could be made about pain, quality of life, anxiety, depression, or drop-out rate(16) \u2013Based on eight RCTs involving 1,518 patients \u2013The authors also concluded that GET appeared more effective than pacing but had similar results as CBT \u2013Further RCTs are required to investigate the most beneficial type, duration, and intensity of exercise intervention",
            "In an exploratory pilot study conducted in Germany, researchers compared the effects of heart-rate  variability biofeedback to GET on fatigue severity in 28 women with ME/CFS (SEID). Each woman in the group was randomly assigned to participate in eight sessions of either heart-rate  variability biofeedback or GET. With heart-rate variability biofeedback, patients learn techniques such as breathing and positive thinking to control the wave form that represents their heart rate. Fatigue severity significantly improved for both groups. In the heart-rate  variability biofeedback group, cognitive aspects of fatigue (depression and mental quality of life) improved significantly, while physical aspects of fatigue (physical quality of life) improved significantly for the GET group(26)",

Both groups received individual therapy sessions of 60\u201390  min/week for 3 consecutive weeks \u2013The APSM intervention was based on a stabilization phase and a grading phase -During the stabilization phase, patients were coached on how to perform ADLs within limits of their actual capacity. Activity duration was 20\u201350%  lower than reported self-capacity  to account for overestimation by patients and each activity block was interspersed with breaks. Once clients could control ADLs without excessive feelings of fatigue, they entered the grading phase -During the grading phase, activity and exercise were increased gradually, based on relevant and achievable personal goals  \u2013The relaxation group included education about the role of stress in ME/CFS (SEID), an evidence-based  information booklet, instruction in various stress reduction skills (Jacobson relaxation, Schultz relaxation, visualization, etc.), and completion of a stress reaction diary, which was discussed with the therapist \u2013Outcome measures were the COPM (for performance of and satisfaction with desired ADLs) and CIS (to measure fatigue). COPM improved significantly in both groups, but only the APSM group had significant differences in satisfaction scores and in CIS",
