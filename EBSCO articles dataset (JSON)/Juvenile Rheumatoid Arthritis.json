Young children will often regress in their developmental skills to compensate for their discomfort(4) \u2013Joint impairments, ligamentous laxity, and muscle imbalances within the hands and/or wrists can significantly impact the child\u2019s ability to perform age-appropriate  activities of daily living (ADLs) and school performance(54) \u2013Children with JIA will often position their joint(s) in flexion, as this position maximizes the joint volume and places the swollen synovium in a comfortable position. This is problematic and leads to the development of flexion contractures and extensor muscle weakness(57) \u2013The onset of JIA is before 16 years of age; most commonly, onset is at 1-3 years of age.
