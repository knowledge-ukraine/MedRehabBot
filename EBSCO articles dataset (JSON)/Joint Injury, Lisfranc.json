            "\u201cLisfranc injury\u201d is a general term for tarsometatarsal injuries that involve the Lisfranc ligament complex and range from an undisplaced mild sprain to severe fracture and dislocation. The severity of displacement is often underestimated on the initial clinical exam soon after injury",
            "General classification of Lisfranc sprains and injuries(1) \u2013Grade 1: Tenderness at the joint complex, but minimal swelling and no instability \u2013Grade 2: Tenderness and swelling, mild laxity but no instability \u2013Grade 3: Complete osteo-ligamentous  disruption, possibly including fracture dislocation, with 2 mm or more joint diastasis",
            "Displacement (often dorsally) of the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bases greater than 2 mm on x-ray  indicates ligamentous instability and the need for surgical fixation to reduce the dislocation",
            "Restoration and maintenance of the anatomic alignment of the Lisfranc joint is the key to appropriate management(9)",
            "A severe Lisfranc dislocation has a high potential for chronic disability, even with surgical correction, and for athletes can be a season-  or career-ending  injury"
