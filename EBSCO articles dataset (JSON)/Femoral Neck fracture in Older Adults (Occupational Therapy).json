            "A hip fracture, more specifically a fracture of the most proximal portion of the femur in the hip joint region, is one of the most common musculoskeletal problems in the older adult population.(1) Hip fractures in older adults often result in disability due to loss of independence and mobility, with patients frequently requiring long-term nursing care or permanent institutionalization(1)",
