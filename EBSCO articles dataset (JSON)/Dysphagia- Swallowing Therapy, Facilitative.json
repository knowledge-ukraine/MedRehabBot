            "Dysphagia therapy can be conceptualized in two ways  direct vs. indirect therapy or compensatory vs. facilitative therapy.(1) Direct dysphagia therapy comprises interventions that involve the presentation of food or liquid, requiring a patient to swallow; indirect dysphagia therapy comprises exercises that indirectly improve the swallow (i.e., the patient is NOT given food or liquid to swallow during the therapy sessions).(1) Compensatory dysphagia therapy comprises interventions that alter the external factors related to swallowing but do not address the underlying dysphagia itself, while facilitative dysphagia therapy comprises interventions that are designed specifically to improve the swallow function.(1) This Clinical Review focuses on facilitative dysphagia therapy. In order to be successful with facilitative dysphagia therapy, the patient will need to be able to follow both simple and complex directions(1)",

Most of the literature addresses oral motor exercises in healthy adults and outcome measures do not include swallow function(1,21) \u2013Authors of a systematic review that included 16 studies that examined the effects of oral-motor  exercises on swallowing in children with dysphagia concluded that there was insufficient evidence that the exercises result in functional improvement of the swallowing mechanism in these children(22) -The most positive treatment effect was found following the 12-month  use of a stimulating oral plate for children with cerebral palsy to improve chewing(22)  \u2013Authors of another systematic review including 12 studies that examined the effects of oral motor interventions for preterm infants with feeding and swallowing difficulties (including nonnutritive sucking, oral/perioral stimulation, and nonnutritive sucking plus perioral stimulation) found that methodological quality varied significantly(23) -Nonnutritive sucking appeared to have the most promise for clinical use; however, given the methodological limitations it was impossible for the authors of the review to draw firm conclusions regarding the clinical application and efficacy of any of these interventions(23) \u2013Can include exercises to improve ROM, strength, and/or coordination of the lips, jaw, and oral tongue(1,24) -Authors of a systematic review on isometric lingual strength-training  programs for dysphagia published in 2017 that included 10 studies reported that the evidence was promising, but the studies were too heterogenous to draw firm conclusions. Authors recommended further research with well-defined subject populations as well as randomized, controlled study designs(49) -In a study conducted in Canada with 6 adults with chronic dysphagia related to an acquired brain injury, researchers used a tongue-pressure resistance training protocol with the goal of increasing strength and accuracy of tongue movements in swallowing(36) -Tongue-pressure  resistance training tasks all involved the use of the Iowa Oral Performance Instrument (IOPI), a handheld manometer with an air-filled  pressure bulb; exercises targeted sustained, isometric pressure with the tongue as well as functional saliva swallows -Each subject completed 24 sessions of tongue-pressure  resistance training over the course of 11\u201312  weeks -At the conclusion of therapy, follow-up measures indicated increases in anterior and/or posterior tongue strength for all 6 participants; 5 of the 6 patients demonstrated a functional improvement in protecting against aspiration. However, bolus clearance and vallecular and pyriform sinus residue clearance did not improve, with deterioration of these skills present in 5 of the 6 patients posttreatment \u2013In a randomized trial conducted South Korea with 35 stroke survivors with dysphagia, an experimental group was treated with a tongue-to-palate  resistance training (TPRT) program and conventional dysphagia therapy including thermal-tactile stimulation, massage, and compensatory strategies. The control group received conventional therapy only(48) -Each participant completed 5 sessions per week over the course of 4 weeks -In the experimental group, TPRT exercises were performed for 30 repetitions each and were performed for both the anterior and posterior sections of the tongue -Baseline/outcome measures were anterior tongue strength and posterior tongue strength, which were both measured with an IOPI, as well as swallow function as measured by a VFSS using the videofluoroscopic dysphagia scale (VDS) and the penetration-aspiration  scale (PAS) -At the conclusion of the study both the experimental and control groups exhibited significant increases in anterior tongue strength, posterior tongue strength, and swallow function as measured by the VDS and PAS. Although tongue strength increased significantly for both groups, the average increase was much greater for the TPRT group (28% increase for anterior, 39% for posterior for the TPRT group and 10% and 18%, respectively, for the control group)",
            "Base-of-tongue  exercise \u2013Effortful swallow -The patient is instructed to exert increased pressure during the swallow; sometimes patient is cued to visualize himself or herself swallowing a larger or \u201charder\u201d bolus, such as a rock(1,24) -The effortful swallow is used as an exercise to increase base of tongue retraction as well as a method to improve tongue base retraction during food and liquid trials in therapy sessions(24) -The effortful swallow is used to increase clearance of the bolus from the pharyngeal or vallecular cavities; the additional effort used in the effortful swallowing increases posterior tongue base retraction, eliminating residual bolus material(24) -Authors of a systematic review of 23 studies on the effortful swallow for both healthy and dysphagic adults concluded that the effortful swallow does result in included increased pressures in the oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal cavities. Insufficient evidence exists for use of the effortful swallow as a rehabilitative exercise for patients with dysphagia(24)",
            "Laryngeal/pharyngeal strengthening exercises \u2013Shaker exercise (an exercise intended to improve pharyngeal dysphagia secondary to abnormal upper esophageal opening) -To perform the Shaker exercise, the patient is instructed to lie flat (or as flat as possible; do not use a pillow), lift the head by trying to look at the toes, keeping the shoulders down, and bringing the chin to the chest, and hold the head in  this position for 60 seconds. The patient performs this portion of the exercise 3 times with 3 breaks of 60 seconds each between repetitions. As the final part of the exercise, the patient is instructed to perform 30 consecutive head lifts in the same manner as above without holding the head up for an extended period of time(43) -In a systematic review published in 2012 that included 9 studies on the effects of the Shaker exercise, authors reported the following: increases in the anterior excursion of the larynx, increases in the anteroposterior diameter of the upper esophageal sphincter (UES) opening, and elimination of dysphagia symptoms. Although the results of the systematic review were promising, researchers were cautious in their interpretation of the outcomes because of the high degree of variability in methodology used in the studies reviewed(44) -In a nontreatment study conducted in the United States, a researcher used surface electromyography (sEMG) to compare muscle activation in healthy female subjects without dysphagia in two different swallowing exercises. The two exercises investigated were an isometric jaw opening to resistance chin-to-chest  exercise and an isometric head-lifting exercise (similar to the Shaker exercise). Subjects had sEMG electrodes placed on their submental skin behind the mandible. The researcher was targeting the hyolaryngeal muscles and compared the amount of activation elicited from each exercise. sEMG measurements revealed significantly more activation of the submandibular hyolaryngeal muscles during the chin-to-chest  exercise versus the head-lifting (Shaker) exercise.(45) These results suggest that the Shaker exercise would not be appropriate for patients in need of an exercise to target/strengthen the hyolaryngeal muscles \u2013Chin tuck against resistance (CTAR): an exercise with muscle engagement similar to that of the Shaker in which patients use a chin-tucking  maneuver to squeeze an inflatable rubber ball as much as possible. This maneuver is repeated 30 times and then the squeeze is held for 30\u201360  seconds(43) -In a study conducted in China, researchers compared effectiveness of the CTAR and Shaker exercises for improvement of both swallowing function and depression. Researchers found similar positive effects on swallowing for both maneuvers; however, more significant improvement in symptoms of depression was noted for the CTAR group(43) \u2013Masako maneuver (tongue-holding  maneuver): an exercise intended to increase posterior pharyngeal wall contraction, resulting in improved contact between pharyngeal wall and base of tongue during the swallow(25) -This maneuver is accomplished by having the patient maximally protrude the tongue and asking him or her to hold the tongue between the teeth (central incisors) while swallowing(25) -The retraction of the base of tongue is restricted, causing increased bulging and stretching of the posterior pharyngeal wall during swallowing(25) -In a study conducted in South Korea, the author found that swallowing improved after treatment with the Masako maneuver 20 minutes per day, 5 days a week for 4 weeks in patients with dysphagia resulting from stroke. Swallowing improvement was measured by Functional Dysphagia Scale (FDS) with VFSSs(25) \u2013Mendelsohn maneuver: intended to increase the amount of time that the larynx is elevated and pulled forward during a swallow, thereby allowing for increased clearance of the pharyngeal cavity and UES(1,26) -Can be done with or without food/liquid boluses -The patient is instructed to begin to swallow and \u201chold\u201d his or her swallow halfway through at the point of maximal laryngeal elevation -In a study conducted in South Korea, researchers investigated the effects of combined Mendelsohn and effortful swallow in patients with dysphagia resulting from stroke. Patients participated in 20 sessions; however, the frequency and number of repetitions was not specified. Aspiration was significantly reduced following intervention as measured by the PAS on VFSSs(26)",
            "NMES therapy: NMES therapy is designed to deliver electrical stimulation to key muscles involved in swallowing for the purpose of retraining and strengthening these muscles, thereby improving swallow function(28) \u2013The electrical stimulation depolarizes the nerve at the neuromuscular junction, resulting in muscle contraction and increased blood flow to the muscles being stimulated(28) \u2013Authors of a meta-analysis  of research studies that compared NMES to traditional dysphagia therapy concluded that NMES was more effective for swallowing rehabilitation in adults with dysphagia of variable etiologies (e.g., head and neck cancer, Parkinson disease); however, for the subgroup of patients with poststroke dysphagia, effects of NMES and traditional therapy were comparable.(34) Studies included in the meta-analysis  were 2 RCTs, 1 multicenter RCT, and 4 controlled clinical trials (CCTs)(34)  \u2013Authors of a systematic review and meta-analysis  published in 2016 that included 8 studies comparing dysphagia therapy with and without NMES found that there was significantly more improvement when NMES was utilized in therapy. Subjects included in these studies all had dysphagia following stroke. Studies included in this systematic review and meta-analysis  assessed only short-term  outcomes; no long-term  data were available(28) \u2013In a study conducted in the United States with 92 patients, researchers compared the efficacy of NMES combined with traditional dysphagia therapy (TDT) and progressive resistance training (PRT) with that of TDT/PRT alone(32) -Treatment took place while the patients were in an inpatient rehabilitation unit after having an acute stroke; all patients were feeding-tube  dependent at the start of the study (FOIS scores of 3 or lower) -65 of the patients in the study received NMES with TDT/PRT and 27 patients (the case-control  group) received only TDT/PRT -Prior to the start of the study, the patients in the NMES group were found to have significantly worse initial FOIS scores as a group -Sessions took place daily and lasted for 1 hour; patients received an average of 18 sessions (\u00b1 3) while in the inpatient rehabilitation unit -Researchers found that there was a significant improvement in swallowing performance for the NMES group compared with the TDT/PRT group. The mean gain in FOIS score for the NMES group was 4.4 points and for the case-control group 2.4 points. Additionally, within the NMES group, 46% of the patients finished treatment with minimal or no swallowing restrictions (FOIS score of 5\u20137),  while only 26% of patients in the case-control  group ended with FOIS scores of 5\u20137",
            "Thermal-tactile  stimulation \u2013In a study conducted in South Korea, researchers compared thermal-tactile  stimulation (TTS) to NMES for treatment of dysphagia in subjects with subacute stroke. The TTS involved rubbing up and down on the anterior faucial arch with an ice stick to facilitate a dry swallow for 30-minute  sessions, 5 days per week for 3 weeks. The FDS was used in pre- and post-therapy  VFSSs to measure outcomes. FDS scores improved for subjects in both therapeutic groups, with no significant difference between the two therapeutic interventions(27) \u2013In a study conducted in Ireland, researchers examined the effects of TTS on pharyngeal transit time in 15 patients with idiopathic Parkinson disease(29) -Swallows took place under videofluoroscopy; 5-mL liquid barium and barium paste delivered via a syringe were used as the boluses -Participants swallowed two separate volumes of liquid barium prior to administration of TTS to allow for a \u201cwarm-up\u201d effect -After the second swallow of liquid barium, the participant received TTS 5 times on each faucial arch and then immediately (no more than 6 seconds later) swallowed another bolus of liquid barium -Entire procedure repeated for barium paste -Statistical analysis demonstrated that TTS significantly reduced pharyngeal transit time, pharyngeal delay, and total transit time with the liquid barium -Median reduction for both pharyngeal transit time and pharyngeal delay was 0.2 second -Median reduction for total transit time was 0.48 second -Statistical analysis demonstrated that TTS significantly reduced pharyngeal transit time and total transit time with the barium paste -Median reduction for pharyngeal transit time was 0.3 second -Median reduction for total transit time was 0.52 second",
            "Intraoral stimulation(47) \u2013In a prospective study conducted in Sweden, researchers investigated the efficacy of an intraoral stimulation program in patients who had poststroke dysphagia. The subject pool comprised 31 patients who were referred to a speech and swallowing center because of self-report  of dysphagia following a stroke. Baseline and outcome measures were a facial activity test (FAT), swallowing capacity test (SCT), and lip force test (LF). At baseline, all 31 subjects exhibited facial dysfunction on the FAT in the lower quadrant of the face, contralateral to the side of the stroke; 93% of the subjects exhibited facial dysfunction in at least one of the other three quadrants of the face. At baseline, only 7% of the subjects had a normal score on the SCT. Subjects were divided into two groups: group 1 began treatment within 5 weeks of their stroke and group 2 began treatment at some time 5 weeks after their stroke. Intraoral stimulation therapy involved 3 months of self-administered therapy using an oral screen or a palatal plate. With the oral screen, the patient was instructed to hold the screen behind closed lips against a pulling force for at least 5 seconds and 3 repetitions. The palatal plate was  inserted in the upper jaw and the patient was trained to perform 9 different exercises with it over the course of 10 to 30 minutes. Both types of intraoral stimulation therapy were to be completed 3 times daily. Immediately following treatment, normal contralateral lower quadrant of the face function was observed in 31% of the patients and normal swallowing function was observed in 42%. Group FAT, SCT, and LF scores significantly improved immediately after the intervention period and remained improved at a 1-year  follow-up.  Both groups 1 and 2 showed significant improvement. Researchers concluded that intraoral stimulation was effective for improving facial and swallowing function in survivors of stroke(47)",
            "Expiratory muscle strength training (EMST): a treatment program using a calibrated one-way,  spring-loaded  valve to mechanically overload the patient\u2019s expiratory and submental muscles(30) \u2013In a randomized, blinded, sham-controlled  trial conducted in the United States with 60 participants with dysphagia as a result of Parkinson disease, researchers found that EMST was an effective facilitative swallowing treatment that resulted in significantly increased hyolaryngeal elevation for those patients in the intervention group(30) -Trial consisted of patients using either an actual EMST handheld device or a sham, uncalibrated device for 4 weeks, 5 days per week, 20 minutes per session -Primary outcome measure was the penetration-aspiration  (PA) score; 33% of patients in the intervention group had improved PA scores; 5% improved PA scores in the control/sham group",
            "Video-assisted  swallowing therapy (V AST) \u2013Researchers in Israel conducted a study with 42 patients with Parkinson disease (all of whom were cognitively intact) to assess the effectiveness of V AST(31) -Study subjects were randomly divided into a control (traditional swallowing therapy) group and V AST group -Baseline/outcome measures included the swallowing disturbance questionnaire (SDQ) (a questionnaire that was originally designed and validated for detecting swallowing problems among patients with Parkinson disease, but is also used in other patient populations as well), a BSE, and a FEES -Both the control group and the V AST group had 5 sessions of therapy over the course of 2 weeks in which patients practiced using compensatory strategies -During the initial FEES, researchers recorded two episodes: the patients\u2019 swallowing process in a natural, pathological way and then with the appropriate use of a given compensatory strategy. The videos were later used during all of the V AST sessions to provide the patients with visual feedback on the effectiveness of the swallowing compensatory strategy -Significant improvement in swallowing functions was observed in both groups comparing pre- to post-therapy  FEESs, BSEs, and SDQ results. On the FEESs, researchers found a significantly greater reduction in pharyngeal residue in the participants who were in the V AST group versus the traditional, control group. In the BSEs, researchers found that V AST group participants exhibited significantly less oral residue and improved timing of the swallowing reflex. There was significantly greater improvement with respect to quality of life as measured by the SDQ in the V AST group as well",
            "Combination therapy: In a small RCT conducted in China, researchers found that the combination of traditional exercise therapy, NMES, and balloon dilatation (a procedure in which the physician inserts a ballooning endoscope into the throat to stretch a narrowed esophagus) resulted in superior outcomes compared to traditional exercise therapy alone.(35) Sixty patients who were treated for nasopharyngeal cancer with radiation therapy and in whom radiation-induced  dysphagia was diagnosed were included in the study. All patients were treated with lingual, pharyngeal, and laryngeal exercises performed 15 times each 3 times per day. In the treatment group, patients were also treated with NMES and balloon dilatation according to individual treatment protocols based on individual needs and swallowing abilities. After 4 months of therapy, the patients\u2019 swallowing function was reassessed by a therapist who did not take part in the rehabilitation of these patients. The water swallow test (patient is required to drink water in increasingly larger amounts) and a VFSS were used as baseline and outcome measures. Outcome measures indicated that the total efficacy rate in the treatment group was significantly higher than in the control group (83.9% vs. 62.1%). However, there were 2 individuals in the treatment group whose swallowing deteriorated after treatment, and none in the control group who experienced this. Additionally, because this was a very small study and the head and neck cancer population is diverse, findings should be interpreted with caution. In order to more definitively determine the efficacy of this type of treatment, larger RCTs should be conducted(35)",
            "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)(33) \u2013tDCS involves constant, low-intensity  current being passed through two electrodes placed on the head. There are two types of stimulation with tDCS: anodal and cathodal stimulation. Anodal stimulation is used to excite neuronal activity and cathodal stimulation inhibits or reduces neuronal activity(33)  \u2013In a prospective, single-center,  single-blind  trial conducted in Japan, researchers used anodal tDCS in combination with conventional swallowing therapy to treat patients with poststroke dysphagia. Researchers found that Dysphagia Outcome and Severity Scale (DOSS) scores improved significantly more for the tDCS group than for a group of patients who received sham tDCS and conventional swallowing therapy(33) \u2013At this time tDCS is used only in research and is not available for clinical use; however, the promising findings in research studies warrant further research into clinical applicability(33) .
