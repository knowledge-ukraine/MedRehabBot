Note complaints of pain associated with ambulation \u2013Use Dynamic Gait Index (DGI) to assess for safety with ambulation \u2013Characteristic rigid gait is common late in the disease with flexion contractures at the hip and knee joints. Patients often ambulate with wide base of support(2) \u2022Muscle strength: Assess trunk and bilateral extremity strength with manual muscle testing of muscle groups found weak on quadrant screening tests \u2022Palpation:  Assess spinal and bilateral extremity joints for tenderness/pain using a V AS and mobility with the Paris Stoddard Scale. Joints and soft tissue structures commonly affected by AS are the SI, costosternal junctions, spinous processes, iliac crests, greater trochanters, ischial tuberosities, and tibial tubercles. Achilles tendon insertion and plantar fascia attachment to the calcaneus are common sites of pain \u2013SI joint mobility should be formally assessed. The SI joint is involved nearly 100% of the time, followed by the intervertebral joints (75%). Patients may have pain and tenderness that mimics SI joint dysfunction and instability(5) \u2022Posture: Assess spinal alignment for loss of cervical lordosis and increased thoracic kyphosis. Assess for leg-length discrepancy using the supine to sit test. Assess patient\u2019s posture in standing and sitting    \u2022Range of motion \u2013Assess active and passive ROM of the spine, upper extremities, and lower extremities. It is common to find limited flexibility in spinal flexion-extension  as well as lateral flexion \u2013Assess flexibility of lower extremity and upper extremity musculature. Hamstring, tensor fascia latae, iliopsoas, and gastrocsoleus muscle are most often affected by AS \u2013Shoulder joint mobility and knee joint mobility are impaired in 30% and 20%, respectively, of individuals with AS(5) \u2022Reflex testing: Assess bilateral deep tendon reflexes; they should be intact and equal bilaterally \u2022Self-care/ADL  performance : Assess patient\u2019s ability to perform self-care  activities and ADLs; use one of the functional impairment special tests to provide additional insight on the impact of AS on the patient\u2019s life. Formal occupational therapy evaluation may be recommended \u2022Special tests specific to diagnosis \u2013Functional impairment can be measured using the BASFI, a self-reported  questionnaire with ten V AS questions (eight AS-specific  questions and two on coping and daily life)(1) \u2013The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) is the most widely used clinical measure of disease activity(1) \u2013The Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) recently replaced the BASDAI. The ASDAS includes elements of the BASDAI, a patient global assessment of disease activity, and CRP or ESR assessments(1) \u2013Gaenslen\u2019s test: Patient in supine with legs extended. Leg of side being tested is passively brought into hip flexion while the other leg stays extended. Overpressure is applied to leg being tested. Test positive for SI pathology if pain is elicited in SI joints(6) \u2013Health Survey Short Form-36  (SF-36)  provides a measure of health-related  quality of life (HRQoL) \u2013Special tests of spinal mobility: Use a measuring tape or inclinometer \u2013Modified Schober trunk flexion test: Patient in standing position with heels together. Mark points on the patient\u2019s spine at the level of the posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS)and also at 10 cm above the PSIS line. Measure the distance between the two points with the patient in maximal active forward trunk flexion. Test positive for restricted lumbar flexion (lumbar lordosis does not reverse) if the distance between marks increases by less than 4 cm. (Note: With the patient in maximal forward flexion, the distance from fingertips to floor can also be measured for assessment of trunk flexion) \u2013Lumbar lateral flexion test: Patient performs maximal trunk lateral flexion (without rotation) in standing position while reaching to floor as examiner measures distance from tip of middle finger to floor. Distance serves as reference measure on follow-up \u2013Occiput to wall test: Patient stands with heels and buttocks against a wall. Examiner measures the distance between occiput and wall as a reference for cervical kyphosis \u2013Chest expansion test: Measure chest expansion at level of 4th intercostal space (males) or just below breasts (females). Less than 5 cm increase with maximal inspiration after maximal expiration suggests a restrictive condition \u2013Segmental mobility testing involves applying posteroanterior force to each spinal level to determine if each level is hypomobile, hypermobile, or normal.(6) Hypomobility helps to support a diagnosis of AS Assessment/Plan of Care",

All interventions were performed over an 8-week  period \u2013Conventional exercises were performed once a week in a group session and five days per week in a home program for 40 minutes per session. Group sessions were led by a physical therapist -Conventional exercises included the following: ROM and flexibility of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine; stretching of the hamstrings, erector spinae, and shoulders; abdominal and diaphragmatic breathing exercises and chest expansion exercises. Participants were instructed to rate exertion on the Borg RPE Scale (6\u201320),  with a goal of achieving 12\u201314  RPE -Inspiratory muscle training was performed three times per week for eight weeks. Exercises started with six loaded inspirations with a 60-second  rest between each.
