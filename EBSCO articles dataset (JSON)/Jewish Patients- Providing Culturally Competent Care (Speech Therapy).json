            "The intent of this Clinical Review is to provide a general profile of Jewish patients across a wide range of dimensions and to help guide speech-language  and/or swallowing evaluation and treatment sessions for Jewish patients",
            "Being Jewish means belonging to a culture and a religion, but not a specific race(1)",
            "Judaism is the religion of Jewish people(1) \u2013Regardless of their country of origin, many Jews around the world consider the State of Israel to be a second homeland, especially because The Law of Return entitles every Jew the right to immigrate to Israel -Israel is a small, Westernized country in the Middle East. It is situated along the eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea and is bordered by Lebanon to the north, Syria to the northeast, Jordan and the West Bank to the east, and Egypt and the Gaza Strip to the south(2) -The State of Israel was established in 1948 following the arrival of hundreds of thousands of Jews, many of whom had fled post-revolutionary  Russia or escaped Nazi rule in Europe. Near-extermination  of the European Jewish population by the Nazis during World War II prompted international support for the formation of the Israeli state and for the 1947 United Nations (UN) Partition Plan for Palestine that would have divided Palestine into separate Arab and Jewish states with Jerusalem under UN control(2,3) \u2013Hebrew is the official language of the State of Israel and is used for all Jewish prayers; however, outside of Israel, Hebrew is not typically the first language of Jews(1)",
            "There are several different branches of Judaism, each with its own set of expectations, practices, and customs(1) \u2013Orthodox: traditional; members attempt to adhere to most of the religious laws of Judaism(1) -Ultra-Orthodox  branches such as the Haredi Judaism and Hasidic Judaism practice the most conservative form of Orthodox Judaism(1) -Members of ultra-Orthodox  branches of Judaism often live in separate communities to preserve their way of life, which can lead to isolation; as a result, children in these communities have fewer opportunities for play and communication interactions and might be delayed in developmental milestones(4) -In a study conducted in Israel, researchers assessed 203 children from ultra-Orthodox low-socioeconomic  communities were at increased risk for gross motor and verbal delays(4) -Fine motor skills and nonverbal cognitive development tested within the average range(4) \u2013Conservative: less strict in Jewish tradition, making concessions for modern culture and society; Conservative Jews might keep a kosher home but not follow these dietary restrictions outside the home(1)  \u2013Reform: the liberal and progressive movement; members of this movement might not engage in any special daily practices but still typically observe holidays, religious rites, and dietary or cultural customs(1) \u2013Reconstructionist: a relatively new movement in Judaism that views the religion as evolving; various views and traditions from Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform are embraced(1) \u2013There are many Jews who consider themselves Jewish but do not actively practice Judaism (or any other religion) and consider themselves secular",
            "There are three broad groupings of Jews based on geographic/regional origins: \u2013Ashkenazi Jews are those individuals who are descendants of European, Eastern European, and Russian Jews(1,2,5) -Ashkenazi Jews make up 82% of the world\u2019s Jewish population(1) \u2013Sephardic Jews have origins in Europe, the Mediterranean, and North Africa(1,2,5) \u2013Eastern or Oriental Jews are those descended from ancient communities in Middle Eastern lands (e.g., the Falasha, who are Black Jews from Ethiopia; Iraqi Jews; and Persian Jews from Iran)(1,2,5) \u2013A \u201csabra\u201d is a Jewish person who was born in Israel(1,2) \u2013Jekkes is a term for a group of German Jews who escaped Nazi Germany and immigrated to Israel between 1933 and 1945; these individuals will be 80 years of age or older(6)",
            "Continued learning and education, both religious and nonreligious, throughout the lifespan is extremely important in the Jewish community(1) \u2013Formal education is highly respected and valued, and many Jewish patients will be highly educated(1) \u2013In the United States, school-aged  Jewish children often attend Hebrew school in addition to public or private school(1)",
            "There is an increased risk of certain genetic disorders among individuals of Jewish descent, especially those who are Ashkenazi(1) \u2013In most cases, these disorders are autosomal recessive, which means that both parents would have to be carriers of the affected gene in order to pass the disorder on to their child(1) \u2013These disorders include Tay-Sachs  disease, Gaucher\u2019s disease, Canavan\u2019s disease, familial dysautonomia, torsion dystonia, Niemann-Pick  disease, Bloom syndrome, Fanconi\u2019s anemia, and mucolipidosis(1,5,7) \u2013Other conditions that occur with increased incidence among Jewish individuals include: -Inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., ulcerative colitis, Crohn\u2019s disease)(1) -Colorectal cancer(4) -Mutations of the BRCA1  and BRCA2  genes, which are associated with breast cancer(1,5)"
