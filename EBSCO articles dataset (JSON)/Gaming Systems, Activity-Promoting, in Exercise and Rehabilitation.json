            "Commercial video gaming systems offer games that focus on exercise through goal-directed  movements of the game player. Numerous exergames have been shown to be feasible for promotion of health and fitness",
            "The intensity of video-based  exergames (VBE) was originally thought to approximate only light-to-moderate  exercise. VBE might thus improve or maintain fitness, particularly in middle-aged  and older sedentary persons, if played regularly and according to established exercise guidelines(1) \u2013However, results from a 2019 randomized crossover trial involving healthy young adults indicated that VBE involving the whole body replicated or even surpassed the physical demands of walking on a treadmill(11) -Based on a United Kingdom study of 25 healthy young adults (average age 22.9 years) -Ten minutes on the Xbox game River Rush was used as the total body workout. Ten minutes of treadmill walking was at self-selected  brisk pace with 1% incline -Outcome measures were peak heart rate, oxygen consumption, metabolic equivalents, and vertical and medial ground reaction forces -The authors also tested reproducibility with a subgroup of 11 participants, with no differences in outcome measures noted",
            "In concept, VBE might also serve as stand-alone  or adjunct exercise therapy to address impairments in strength, endurance, balance, or coordination. Most notably, VBE has been associated with favorable functional outcomes in stroke rehabilitation research,(2)children and adolescents, older adults, and Parkinson\u2019s disease",
            "Although there is overlap between virtual reality (VR) and gaming systems, there are significant differences between them. Unlike in video games, users of VR are immersed in and able to interact with 3-  dimensional worlds. As such, VR has the potential to be individualized to a patient\u2019s interests; however, it is not as convenient for use as it is not as readily available",

Participants could opt for more difficult levels of each game as appropriate -Outcome measures included fall risk via the Physiological Profile Assessment (PPA) and a 12-month  fall-incident  report -Wii Fit training was found to be statistically more effective than conventional balance training for decreasing fall risk in older nursing home residents with a history of falls",
            "Based on a 2016 systematic review, VBE supports cognitive function and dual-task  function in older adults, although it is unclear if it has any superior benefit to traditional physical exercise alone(9) -Evidence included 5 RCTs and 2 uncontrolled studies",
            "Evidence regarding VBE and stroke \u2013Wii Fit games in conjunction with cognitive tasks was more effective in improving cognitive performance during dual-task  reactive conditions and motor performance during dual-task  volitional conditions when compared to conventional training (customized, progressive balance training) in persons with chronic stroke(19) -Based on an RCT conducted in the United States involving 24 patients with chronic stroke -Both groups underwent 6 weeks of training -Outcomes were dual-task  conditions on limits of stability (volitional) and slip-perturbation (reactive) tests and letter-number  sequencing (cognition) \u2013Based on a single-blind  RCT in Israel, VBE and traditional therapy both improve physical activity in patients with chronic stroke(8) -Forty-seven  community-dwelling  participants were randomly assigned to receive VBE or traditional therapy. Participants had to have had a single stroke at least 6 months prior to the study -Both groups received interventions for 1hour, 2 times per week for 3 months. In both groups, sessions were led by 3 to 4 occupational therapists and included groups of 6 to 8 participants -VBE included multiple stations and game consoles (i.e., Microsoft Xbox Kinect, Sony PlayStation 2 EyeToy, Sony PlayStation 3 MOVE, Nintendo Wii Fit, and the SeeMe VR system), which participants rotated through. Games and consoles were selected by the supervising occupational therapists based on their clinical knowledge and knowledge of the games. All game sessions were active and performed standing -Traditional therapy included combinations of UE and LE movement, stretching, marching, walking, and functional tasks (e.g., picking up objects and transferring them to the other side of the room) -Outcome measures were performed at baseline, at the 3-month  conclusion of intervention, and at 3months post intervention -Both groups demonstrated significant within-subject improvements for gait speed at pre- and post- intervention; neither group maintained benefit at 3-month  follow-up -Both groups demonstrated significant improvement of bilateral grip strength pre- to post-test  which was maintained at the 3-month  follow-up -No significant changes were found in daily steps or UE functional mobility \u2013VBE might improve arm function and ADLs in patients after stroke(2) -Based on a 2015 Cochrane systematic review of 37 trials with 1,019 participants. Most participants were more than 1-year  post stroke  -UE function improved significantly in 12 studies (n = 397) -ADLs improved significantly in 8 studies (n = 253) -No significant effects were found for handgrip strength, gait speed, or global motor function -Only a few mild adverse events (e.g., dizziness, headache) were reported across studies",
            "Evidence regarding VBE and Parkinson\u2019s disease \u2013Authors of a 2018 systematic review concluded that the Nintendo Wii seemed effective to improve functional outcomes, especially with respect to balance, and health in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease but indicated that 4 of the 7 included studies were of bad methodological quality(20) -The authors called for better methodological quality and standardization of games, intensity, and frequency suitable for patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease \u2013Authors of a 2019 systematic review concluded that VBE is safe, feasible and has at least similar outcomes to other interventions for Parkinson\u2019s disease. They also called for standardization, better methodological trials, and further insight into new sensors and different \u201ccognitive stadiums\u201d of Parkinson\u2019s disease (such as Parkinson\u2019s disease with mild cognitive impairment)(21)",
            "The following studies provide mixed examples of the intervention benefit: \u2013Authors of Spanish RCT concluded that VBE are effective in improving the physical fitness of women with fibromyalgia under single-  or dual-task  conditions(22) -Based on a study of 50 women with fibromyalgia in which the intervention group completed 24 weeks of supervised and group-based  exergames, performed twice a week for 60 minutes. Control group did not participate -Results with single-task  condition: intervention group significantly better in arm curl test, sit and reach test, and TUG -Results with dual-task  condition: intervention group significantly better in all physical fitness tests (all listed single-task conditions plus back-scratch test) \u2013Authors of a 2018 systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that there was not enough evidence to determine if VBE improve musculoskeletal pain(23) -Based on 7 articles for the systematic review and 6 articles for the meta-analysis -Four of the 7 articles reported significant effects but the zero point was included in the overall effect size, indicating that the overall effect size was not significant \u2013Authors of an RCT in Switzerland compared the effect of Wii Fit exercise training, conventional physical therapy, and no treatment for individuals with lateral ankle sprains(7) -Ninety participants with grade I or grade II lateral ankle sprains were randomized into three groups. Sprains were assessed at baseline and 6-week follow-up -The Wii Fit group performed 4 balance games \u2013 Ski Slalom, Penguin Slide, Table Tilt, and Balance Bubble. Patients were initially instructed by a PT on the equipment and exercises. After initial training, the patients performed the exercises at home 2 times per week, 30 minutes per session for 6 weeks -The conventional physical therapy group was treated by a physical therapist. Interventions included modalities, joint mobilization, muscle strengthening and proprioceptive exercises. Patients in this group received 9 sessions, 30 minutes each for 6 weeks -The no-treatment  group served as the control and received no intervention -All groups had statistically significant improvement evidenced by Foot and Ankle Ability Measure questionnaire and V AS for pain. There were no between-group  differences found -Although the Wii Fit group had significant improvement, it was no more effective than conventional physical therapy or no therapy at all \u2013Wii Fit Plus training improves functional ankle instability(10) -Based on a study in South Korea that included 20 patients in their 20s who had functional ankle instability -Participants were randomized into 2 groups \u2013 a balance training group or a strength training group; each group performed a total of 30 minutes of activity, 3 times per week for 4 weeks. All interventions were performed on the Wii Fit Plus -Strengthening activities included lunges, single-leg extension, lateral leg lifts, single-leg  twists, and rowing squats -The balance training group performed activities such as tightrope walking, soccer heading, tilting, and slalom skiing -The strength training group demonstrated significant improvement in plantar flexion and dorsiflexion strength. No significant improvement was noted in ankle inversion and eversion strength  -The balance training group demonstrated significant improvement in plantar flexion, dorsiflexion, and ankle eversion and inversion .
