            "Hemophilia is an X-linked  group of bleeding disorders with a recessive pattern of inheritance. Hemophilia is due to a mutation of the factor VIII ( F8) gene (hemophilia A) or factor IX ( F9)gene (hemophilia B), which results in a coagulant deficiency. Hemophilia A and hemophilia B are clinically indistinguishable but can be differentiated by factor assay testing. Hemophilia is classified by the severity of the disorder and by the factor that is deficient, based on the results of the factor VIII/IX assay",

        "It is important for a child\u2019s general health and joint status to be monitored on a regular basis. Recommendations are for a full physical assessment every 3\u20136 months the first year and then at least once a year, to include a thorough musculoskeletal evaluation by a physical therapist, an inhibitor screen, liver tests, and test for antibodies to hepatitis viruses and HIV(1)",
        "Parents are advised to vaccinate all children who require or may require blood products against hepatitis A and B. Consider immunization with inactivated hepatitis A vaccine because contaminated clotting factor concentrates have been identified(1,5)",
        "Primary caregivers should be taught to perform venipuncture and how to administer factor treatment to children over 2 to 3 years of age. The child can learn the procedure for self-administration  between the ages of 8 and 12 years(8)",
        "Children should be taught to take responsibility for their disease at an early age. In this way they can learn early their limitations, preventive measures, and self-administration  of the factor replacement(8) The HEMO-milestones  tool may be a useful assessment to evaluate self-management  competence for patients with hemophilia who are transitioning from pediatric to adult care(14) Children with hemophilia learn self-management  skills (i.e., bleed recognition, self-infusion,  self-medicine  management, pain and risk management, and preventive therapy) at a relatively young age and primarily through experiential learning and individualized education rather than formal patient programs(15) Authors of a study of 108 Iranian adolescents with hemophilia aged 12 to 19 years concluded that the participants did not engage in practices to prevent complications(13) \u2013A convenience sample was used to distribute a questionnaire regarding lifestyle and disease management habits \u201332.1% of participants controlled active bleeding within the first hour \u201339.0% used analgesics to control pain associated with bleeding. 19.8% used nonpharmacologic methods to control pain \u201365.4% did not participate in sports activities. Of those who participated in sports, 70.5% allocated < 5 hours per week to sports \u2013Overall trends indicated that dental care, exercise patterns, and dietary habits were not favorable for disease and complication management",
        "Recommendations to prevent oral bleeding when performing daily dental hygiene are using a water irrigation device, softening the bristles with warm water prior to brushing, using a sponge-tipped  disposable toothbrush, and using a small, soft-bristle  toothbrush(8)",
