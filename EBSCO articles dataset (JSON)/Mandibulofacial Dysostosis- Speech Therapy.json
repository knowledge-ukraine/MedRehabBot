These errors might be related to malocclusion, velopharyngeal problems, hearing loss, or other causes. There is usually more than one factor contributing to an articulation disorder.(5) Phonemes most affected tend to be /s, z, t, d, n, p, b, m/. Patients tend to lateralize sibilants and direct airstream through lateral spaces in the teeth. Malocclusion can make lip closure for bilabial sounds difficult to achieve for patients with TCS. Those patients with cleft palate (up to 35% of patients with TCS) typically present with compensatory misarticulation errors (CMAs) or sound substitutions such as glottal stop, pharyngeal fricative, and mid-dorsum  palatal stop.(5) Check for presence of any compensatory articulation errors (learned articulation errors that a child with cleft palate or VPI may use to achieve appropriate pressure-valving  needed for speech). Examples of CMAs are glottal stop, pharyngeal stop, pharyngeal fricative, pharyngeal affricate, posterior nasal fricative, nasal fricative, and mid-dorsum  palatal stop.(12) Note the context in which these sound errors occur (e.g., at the sound level, word level, sentence level). Assess speech-sound  perception and discrimination abilities using a minimal-pair  identification task. Due to increased risk of hearing impairment, it is important to assess discrimination abilities. Screening and articulation -Goldman-Fristoe  Test of Articulation-3rd edition (GFTA-3)\u2013  Used to assess articulation of consonant sounds in individuals 2\u201321  years of age. This test assesses single-word  production in imitation, spontaneous use, and in connected speech  -Assessment of Phonological Processes (Revised) \u2013 Can be used to evaluate the use of phonological processes in children who are highly unintelligible -Khan-Lewis  Phonological Analysis (KLPA) \u2013 This test can be used to assess the use of 15 phonological processes in children aged 2\u20135 years. The KLPA is often used in conjunction with the Goldman-Fristoe Test of Articulation-3 -Great Ormond Street Speech Assessment (GOS.SP.ASS) \u2013Can be used to assess cleft palate speech and articulation errors in patients of all ages(12)Assess direction of nasal airflow and intraoral air pressure -Nasometry can be used to analyze acoustic energy passing through the oral and nasal cavities. Nasometry yields a nasalance score (normal nasalance is 25\u201333%).(13)Nasalance scores above 33% indicate some degree of hypernasality -Oral manometry can be used on patients of all ages to measure intraoral air pressure. Mean oral air pressure below 3 cm H2O is considered abnormal and may indicate VPI and velopharyngeal openings during oral speech. If the VP port is not sufficiently closed during oral speech, reduced oral air pressure will result, affecting high-pressure  sounds such as / p, b, t, d, k, g/(12) T708864Perform a screening of the patient\u2019s receptive and expressive language skills.

Determine presence of resonance disorder. Examples -Perceptual evaluation is a subjective measure that is used to make a clinical diagnosis of VPI and to determine if it is appropriate to treat the client for a resonance disorder(14)Ensure the nose is clear of any mucous prior to the evaluation, listen for stridency during nose breathing, place a mirror beneath the nostrils to view fogging patterns, and have the patient repeat words to listen for nasal emission. Assess for hypernasality by asking the patient to repeat 10 single-syllable  words beginning with a /b/ and ending with a /t/ (beet, bit, bait, bet, etc.). Patients with VPI will usually exhibit greater nasality on the words with high vowels (/u/ and /i/) and less nasality on words with low (/a/) vowels(14)Patient should be asked to repeat words and phrases containing high-pressure  consonants (i.e., \u201cPass the pepper please,\u201d \u201cTerry took the top hat,\u201d \u201cChoosy kids choose Jif\u201d).(14) Patients with TCS sometimes exhibit significant hypernasality or nasal air emission on the consonants in the sentencesAsk the patient to count from 60 to 80, which is especially difficult for patients with VPI. Listen for hypernasality and nasal air emission(14) -Cleft Audit Protocol for Speech\u2013Augmented  (CAPS-A)  is a speech tool that can be used to analyze speech articulation and nasality in children over the age of 5 years. Percentage of consonants correct is calculated. In addition, hyponasality is rated on a 3-point  scale (absent to marked hyponasality). Patient hypernasality is rated on a 5-point scale indicating \u201cabsent\u201dhypernasality to \u201csevere\u201dhypernasality(13) -Instrumental measures -Nasendoscopy allows the clinician to visualize the velopharynx during phonation. The degree and pattern/type (coronal, sagittal, circular, circular with Passavant\u2019s ridge) of velopharyngeal closure can then be observed.

            "General protocol management based on a review of care of 50 patients with diagnosed TCS is outlined below. Many of the issues delineated below are addressed by physicians, craniofacial surgeons, and other health professionals rather than SLPs. They are included below if they pertain to the ability of the patient to successfully breathe, eat, swallow, and speak:(17) \u2013Airway and feeding issues are of primary concern in children with TCS from birth to age 2 years -Tracheostomy might be required to allow safe breathing in children with airway obstruction. This is necessary in up to 25% of patients with TCS(5) -Tracheostomy is required in up to 86% of patients with TCS with cleft palate(5) -Complications of the tracheostomy are common (e.g., accidental obstruction); management can be lifelong in cases of permanent tracheostomy(5) -Surgical mandibular lengthening can reduce risk of airway obstruction. Mandibular lengthening allows the tongue base to be placed in a more forward position and might reduce or eliminate need for tracheostomy(5) -Feeding difficulties sometimes result from airway obstruction and difficulty coordinating swallowing and breathing. Swallowing can also be impaired as a result of hypoplasia of the oral and pharyngeal structures. Cleft palate can reduce intraoral pressure required for sucking in infants. Abnormal feeding patterns can develop in infants and children who are fed using nasopharyngeal or gastrostomy feeding tubes. Dental malocclusion can impair mastication and affect overall feeding and nutrition.(5)For detailed information on dysphagia in infants and children, see Clinical Review\u2026Dysphagia in Childhood , referenced above \u2013Cleft palate repair typically is addressed early in life; in a retrospective study conducted in the United States that included 50 patients with TCS, 11 patients (22%) presented with cleft palate that required repair early in life(17) \u2013Reconstruction of the upper face using bone grafts or flaps is also undertaken at a young age (2\u201312  years)(17)  \u2013Orthognathic surgery is often performed on teenagers to correct cranioskeletal anomalies(17) \u2013A speaking valve might allow for improved communication in patients with long-term  tracheostomies.(5) For detailed information on the use of speaking valves, please see Clinical Review\u2026Passy-Muir  Tracheostomy & Ventilator Swallowing and Speaking Valve , referenced above \u2013Yearly evaluations by the following professionals are recommended: otolaryngologist; dentist; ophthalmologist; orthodontist; SLP (yearly until age 4.5, assessment at age 8 and 12 years); craniofacial surgeon(17)",
            "Feeding/oral motor \u2013In cases of cleft palate, the SLP should work together with the craniofacial team to assess safety of swallowing and plan treatment goals or make feeding modifications when appropriate. For detailed information on feeding therapy for children with cleft palate, please see Clinical Review\u2026Feeding Disorders: Infants with Cleft Palate ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T708978",

The SLP may try using standard articulation therapy methods in remediating sound errors, substitutions, and sound distortions. The SLP should consider physical limitations of the patient (e.g., malocclusion, open bite, cleft palate, VPI) when preparing therapy goals and making a prognosis. For detailed information on speech therapy for patients with cleft palate, see Clinical Review\u2026 Cleft Lip and Palate , referenced above",
