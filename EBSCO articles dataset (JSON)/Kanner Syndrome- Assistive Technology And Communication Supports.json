            "ASD is a newly defined disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM -5) published in 2013 that encompasses 4 diagnoses that in the DSM-IV  and ICD-10  were included under the term pervasive developmental disorder (PDD)(51) \u2013This reflects scientific consensus that the 4 previously separate diagnoses are a single condition with different levels of symptom severity",
            "ASD encompasses the following previously separate diagnoses: \u2013Autism(51) \u2013Asperger\u2019s disorder(51) \u2013Childhood disintegrative disorder(51) \u2013Pervasive developmental disorder\u2013not  otherwise specified (PDD-NOS)(51)",
            "Individuals with a well-established  DSM-IV  diagnosis of autism/autistic disorder, Asperger\u2019s disorder, PDD-NOS,  or childhood disintegrative disorder should now be given the diagnosis of ASD(1)",
            "ASD is characterized by(1) \u2013deficits in social communication and social interaction \u2013restricted repetitive behaviors, interests, and activities (RRBs)",
            "Both components are required for a diagnosis of ASD(51)",
            "Severity of ASD is defined based on amount of support required as follows:(51) \u2013Level 1: Requires support -Social communication -Without supports in place, the deficits in social communication cause noticeable impairments -Difficulty initiating social interactions and precise examples of atypical or unsuccessful responses to social overtures of others -Might appear to have decreased interest in social interactions -RRBs -Inflexible behavior causes significant interference with functioning in one or more contexts  -Difficulty switching between activities -Organizational and planning difficulties impair age-appropriate  independence \u2013Level 2: Requires substantial support -Social communication -Marked deficits in verbal and nonverbal social communication skills -Social impairments apparent even with supports in place -Limited initiation of social interactions -Reduced or abnormal responses to social cues from others -RRBs -Inflexible behavior, difficulty coping with change, or other RRBs that appear frequently enough to be obvious to the casual observer and interfere with functioning in a variety of contexts -Distress and/or difficulty changing focus or action \u2013Level 3: Requires very substantial support -Social communication -Severe deficits in verbal and nonverbal social communication skills causing severe impairments in functioning -Very limited initiation of social interactions -Minimal response to social cues from others -RRBs -Inflexible behavior, extreme difficulty coping with change, or other RRBs markedly interfering with functioning in all realms -Great distress/difficulty changing focus or activity",
            "Rationale for the new diagnostic definitions and criteria: \u2013A perceived lack of precision with the former diagnostic categories; different clinicians would diagnose different disorders in the same person(52) \u2013A belief that there is a common set of behaviors that can be characterized according to severity(52) \u2013There is a spectrum of manifestations that vary greatly depending on the severity level, developmental level, and chronological age(51)",
            "Assistive technology and communication supports for persons with ASD can be used to enhance, expand, and develop communication skills(53) \u2013Children with ASD often have difficulty with spoken and written language expression, understanding spoken language, and understanding gestures, body language, and tone of voice used to convey differences in meaning. Motor planning problems can interfere with ability to coordinate the muscles needed for speaking, writing, or using sign language(53) \u2013Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) approaches include unaided approaches (signs, gestures), \u201clow-tech\u201d picture-based  systems (e.g., Picture Exchange Communication System [PECS]), communication books and boards, speech-generating  devices (SGDs), and portable word processors (e.g., iPads)(53) \u2013Specialized communication-related  applications for devices such as tablets and smartphones are becoming more widely available(58)",

            "Before obtaining any assistive technology for a child with ASD, it is necessary to have the child evaluated by an expert who can assess the child\u2019s specific needs and guide the use of the technology. This typically involves conducting a feature-matching  analysis that matches technology features to the needs of the child \u2013An assistive technology evaluation may be obtained through a child\u2019s school, or privately through specialized centers. Schools often contract out the evaluations to assistive technology experts or independent evaluators",

Examples include Easter Seals, the National Autism Association (United States), the Adam Scott Foundation Autism Grants Program (Australia), Apps for Children With Special Needs (A4cwsn), iHelp for Special Needs, and the iTaalk Autism Foundation. State-run assistive technology programs may also provide funding. The Autism Society maintains a resource database at http://www.autismsource.org/",

The reasons appear to be multifactorial and include the following: heightened public awareness; improved screening and evaluative tools; the change in diagnostic criteria and categories in the DSM  since autism was first included in the DSM-III  in 1980; passage of the IDEA in 1990, which provided services in the school system to children in whom ASD was newly diagnosed as well as children in whom the condition was diagnosed under a different educational label such as \u201cmental retardation,\u201d speech impairment, or learning disabilities.(57) ASD is commonly diagnosed around age 4 years; however, parental concerns about their child\u2019s behavior generally begin around 12\u201318  months of age(3)",

A sound inventory can be completed for children who have severely limited speech. For specific sounds, the number of omissions, substitutions, distortions, and additions can be calculated. In addition to errors at the segment level, the SLP should note other aspects that affect speech intelligibility, such as low volume, rapid delivery, or repetition of words.(65) For detailed information on assessment of speech sound disorders, see the series of Clinical Reviews on this topicChildren with severe to profound ASD and ID may be in the early stages of communication. The impact of any motor difficulties should be considered when evaluating the child\u2019s ability to respond to and initiate communication. Early communication can be assessed informally by means of a language sample and observation that document forms (i.e., gesture, vocalizations) and functions of communication (i.e., requests, comments)The CSBS-DP  can be used to assess expressive language, social communication abilities, and symbolic abilities by means of a parent report and directthe Infant-Toddler Checklist, the Caregiver Questionnaire, and a 30-minute behavior sample of the child.

The assessment covers communication skills that would typically occur from birth to 24 months of age. It can be used for individuals of all ages who are at the earliest stages of communication(68)Assessment of receptive and expressive language should include a combination of formal and informal measures (language samples). Assessment of language comprehension (i.e., receptive language) is necessary to 1) determine how well the child understands spoken language input, 2) determine if augmentation of spoken language is beneficial to the child (i.e., visuals), 3) identify if there are discrepancies between the child\u2019s comprehension and expression, and 4) determine the optimal way to teach AAC symbols.(65) Assessment of expressive language should provide information on the child\u2019s functional communication skills, including the frequency of communicative functions,Informal language measures are useful to examine the child\u2019s comprehension of language in different situations, the child\u2019s responsiveness to communication, mean utterance length (MLU), word use/ vocabulary, echolalia, pronoun use, and pragmatics.(65) Informal measures can include observations of the child during home and school instructional and play situations as well as observation during specific elicitation activities. Elicitation measures can be used to encourage the child to communicate. The following are some techniques to elicit specific -Keep toys away from the child but within sight so that the child is required to request them(69) -Eat a snack in front of the child without offering the food to the child (to elicit requests)(69) -Provide a mystery box or opaque container with objects. When the child withdraws an object, he or she may comment on the object(69) -Engage in social routines (i.e., blowing bubbles) and provide an interruption so that the child may request continuation(69) -Elicit requests of parts of toys or puzzles by offering some but not all of the parts(69) -Pretend to misunderstand or not hear when the child speaks to elicit a conversational repair(69)  -Provoke a comment by doing something silly (e.g., wear funny hat) or by pointing to a noteworthy object (e.g., bandage on a finger)(69)Comprehensive test batteries for language can be used with children who are able to respond to test questions.

The frequency of independent and prompted mands was used as a dependent variable for this study. The interventional mand training was performed in sessions with 15 trials each. In the mand training sessions, a researcher would present the participant with three preferred items and ask the participant to select one. When the participant reached for an item it was then placed out of the child\u2019s reach, but within view, and the PECS or iPad with the picture of the item was placed in front of the child. If the child did not use the AAC to request the item within 5 seconds, the researcher modeled how to do so. Once the child had the preferred item, he was allowed to play with it for 30 seconds and then it was taken back for the next trial. At the conclusion of the study, researchers found that the overall rate of independent manding across training and maintenance intervals was higher for 4 of the 5 participants using the iPad-based  SGD.
