Further studies are warranted \u2013A course of up to 10 sessions of acupuncture over 5\u20138 weeks for the prophylactic treatment of CTTH is recommended in clinical guidelines published by the United Kingdom\u2019s National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE)(10) \u2013MSN treatment uses a medical instrument similar to the acupuncture needle. The needle is inserted into tender points and moved up and down to relieve pain and then withdrawn when the strong needling sensation is decreased. Authors of a systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the clinical efficacy and safety of MSN treatment(36) -Seven RCTs were evaluated.

Patients in the treatment group trained for 10 weeks using elastic resistance bands. Patients in the control group performed ergonomic and posture correction exercises(40) -There was no significant difference in efficacy between the two groups.Although both groups showed a decrease in frequency and duration of TTH, neither group met the predefined threshold for clinical significance of a 30% decrease -Frequency of TTH in the strength training group decreased by 11% and duration decreased by 10%, while the ergonomic and posture correction group showed a reduction in frequency of 24% and a decrease in duration of 27% -A combined treatment of ergonomics and posture and strength training neck/shoulder muscles may be effective for CTTH patients",
            "Manual therapy/massage therapy \u2013Authors of a critical review of manual therapy for all types of headache disorders found that manual therapy was the most common non-medical  treatment used. The self-reported effectiveness of manual therapy varied depending on the provider and ranged from 17% to 82%(41) \u2013The results of several systematic reviews investigating the effectiveness of spinal manipulation in the management of TTH are all inconclusive.(23) At this time, evidence-based  guidelines recommend spinal manipulation for the management of migraines and cervicogenic headaches but not TTH(24)  \u2013Manual therapy and manipulative therapy may both be effective treatments for pain perception and neck mobility in patients with TTH(19) -84 adults with TTH were randomly assigned to receive manual therapy, manipulative therapy, or a combination of manual and manipulative therapy -Both treatments, administered separately or together, resulted in decreased pain perception -Cervical ROM improvement was greater in groups receiving separately administered treatments \u2013Researchers who conducted a double-blind  RCT in the United States concluded that a combination of soft tissue and neural mobilization techniques in the treatment of frequent ETTH and CTTH was superior in increasing pressure pain threshold and reducing frequency and maximal intensity of symptoms than performing either alone(27) \u2013Authors of a review of the literature concluded that massage therapy should be considered as an adjunct treatment for ETTH and can be combined with medications for management of CTTH. Although there is not extensive support in the literature for massage therapy, it does not have any adverse side effects and may have some positive impact on central sensitization. They reviewed one methodologically sound RCT that found that trigger point release massage therapy in patients with TTH decreased headache intensity and improved pain pressure thresholds in all treated muscles(39) \u2013Authors of a case series of four female patients with CTTH found that massage therapy interventions including neuromuscular therapy, myofascial trigger point release, and consideration of central sensitization mechanisms may help address the symptoms of CTTH. All four patients received a total of 6 45-minute  interventions over 3 weeks(42) -All four patients had decreased headache frequency \u2013Thai traditional massage (TTM) has been shown to be effective at increasing pressure pain threshold in patients with CTTH and migraine headaches(22) -Based on a 2014 RCT conducted in Thailand including 72 subjects who had a headache diagnosis for at least 3 months prior to the study, headache intensity score of 4 or greater on a V AS, and had headaches present for 15 days per month at a frequency of at least 2 times per week -Subjects in the TTM group received TTM for 25 minutes and stretching for 5 minutes according to the pattern of the royal Thai massage. Massage points included in this method are the three lines on the head, upper neck, and upper back covering the temporalis, upper trapezius, posterior neck extensors, and levator scapulae. Experienced massage therapists applied thumb pressure until the participant started to experience some discomfort (subpain threshold) and that pressure point was then held for 5 to 10 seconds. This sequence was repeated 3 to 5 times for each meridian line -Subjects in the control group received a sham ultrasound application -Both groups received nine 30-minute  sessions over a 3-week  period -Outcome measures were taken after the treatment and at 3 and 9weeks following completion of the study -Subjects in the TTM group had a significant increase in pressure pain threshold compared with the control group at the 3- and 9-week  follow-ups -In both groups, headache intensity decreased significantly at every end point of the outcome measures. There was no difference between groups for headache intensity",
            "Positional release \u2013Authors of an RCT (N = 26) investigated whether positional release technique (PRT) affects central sensitization in patients with TTH and MTrPs. The primary outcome measure was a brain metabolic profile. Secondary outcome measures included headache frequency and intensity, McGill score, and pressure pain threshold(30) -Patients were assigned either to the control or intervention group. The intervention group received 2 individual sessions of PRT for each active MTrP for 5 weeks. Each session lasted 1\u20131.5  hours -The expected changes in the metabolite concentrations did not occur, indicating that PRT did not affect the CNS -Secondary measures including headache frequency, headache intensity, McGill score, and local pressure pain threshold changed significantly after PRT -Although the study did not prove that PRT can affect central sensitization it is a potential treatment option for decreasing symptoms",
            "Dry needling and friction massage \u2013Authors of an RCT (N = 44) compared dry needling and friction massage to treat patients with TTH. The patients received either dry needling or friction massage treatments for 3 sessions over the course of 1 week. They were reevaluated 48 hours after the last treatment(28) -Dry needling and friction massage were equally effective in decreasing the frequency of headaches, the intensity of headaches, and in increasing cervical ROM. The PPT increased significantly more after dry needling ",
            "TENS \u2013There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of TENS for TTH, based on systematic reviews(17) \u2013Supraorbital transcutaneous electrical stimulator (SOES) is a new medical device approved by the U.S. FDA designed to manage all types of headache. The electrodes are placed over the trigeminal nerve in the supraorbital region to excite the peripheral sensory nerves. Authors of an RCT (N = 45) investigated the effects of SOES treatment in patients with CTTH(43) -Patients were randomly assigned to one of three groups: Standardized physiotherapy program 3 times/week for 8 weeks, standardized physiotherapy program 3 times/week for 8 weeks plus SOES for 20 minutes/daily for 8 weeks, or a control group that received only analgesic medications (aspirin and/or ibuprofen) -Outcome measures included the Headache Impact Test (HIT), headache frequency, and V AS -Both groups receiving the physiotherapy program alone and physiotherapy program plus SOES improved significantly in all 3 outcome measures, but the physiotherapy program plus SOES improved more. The control group showed no significant improvements in any measure",
            "Cryotherapy \u2013Low compliance due to cold intolerance hinders compliance with cold pack therapy. Authors of an RCT (N = 53) compared two types of cryotherapy in patients with TTH: a newly devised cold pack that targeted the upper normal therapeutic range versus an ice pack(38) -Patients were instructed to place the cooling modality over the forehead for \u2264 30 minutes each session for 4 weeks. They were asked to keep a log of how many times per day they applied the modality. There was no limit -The patients who used the newly devised cold pack reported lower cold intolerance, used the modality more frequently, and took fewer analgesics than those patients using the ice pack -A tolerable cold therapy that targets skin temperatures low enough to achieve a therapeutic effect but is high enough to lower discomfort levels could improve the QOL of patients with TTH .
