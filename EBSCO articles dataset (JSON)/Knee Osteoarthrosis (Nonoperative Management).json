            "Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is characterized by slow degeneration of intraarticular cartilage that progresses to involve subchondral synovium and bone. The development of chronic pain and joint stiffness interfere with ADLs and reduce health-related  quality of life (HRQoL)(8)",
            "Many patients and healthcare providers accept the pain and disability of knee OA as inevitable consequences of a progressive disease that eventually will require joint replacement. However, knee joint injury associated with obesity and impaired muscle function is amenable to secondary prevention strategies and rehabilitation.(15) In clinical guidelines, the most strongly recommended nondrug, nonoperative interventions for knee or hip OA are exercise and weight loss(16)",
            "Authors of a 2015 Cochrane review found high-quality  evidence from 44 trials (N = 3,537 participants with knee OA) that land-based exercise training reduced pain significantly and improved physical function to a moderate degree(17)",
