            "Calcific tendinitis of the shoulder (CT) is a condition associated with crystal calcium hydroxyapatite deposition in one or more of the rotator cuff tendons.(1) The calcifications likely disturb normal shoulder joint mobility. Physical functioning of the affected shoulder is typically limited by activity-related  pain(29)",
            "Patients may present in acute, subacute, or chronic stages of CT. Most acute cases resolve spontaneously. In chronic stages, the supraspinatus tendon is usually involved, and late-developing  sequelae often include subacromial impingement(2)",
            "Uhthoff's classification includes a pre-calcific  stage in which tenocytes undergo metaplasia to chondrocytes, followed by a calcific stage, and post-calcific  phase. The calcific phase is further delineated into formative, resting, and resorptive phases(35). Pain is reported worst during the resorptive phase",
            "The initial management approach is usually conservative, which involves therapeutic modalities for pain management and exercises for restoring deficits in shoulder flexibility and strength,(2,3,4,5) as well as shoulder mechanics and scapular stability. Oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory  drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly prescribed",
            "Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) and ultrasound-guided  needling (UGN) are other management options. Arthroscopic debridement or decompression surgery may be necessary when the calcifications are large or pain persists after conservative treatment(3,29,30,38)"

            "The pathogenic mechanism of CT is unclear. One theory proposesthat localized hypovascularitymay trigger calcification(9)",
            "Incomplete endochondral calcification creates a fibrocartilage-like  tendon; this is followed by an infiltration ofphagocytosing cells, formation of new vascular channels, and calcium resorption that self-limits  the condition(9,10)",
            "The calcific material producesa vigorous inflammatory response, as indicated by increased accumulation of mast cellsand macrophages. This phase is followed by neovascularization and neoinnervation in the lesions that are associated withincreased pain during the resorptive phase(36)",
            "Pain and restriction of movement are worst in the resorptive phase because the calcium crystals extravasate into thesubacromial bursa(11)",
            "A current theory is that weakening of the muscle-tendon  complex leads tothe formation of tenocytes. These new tenocytesdifferentiate into hypertrophic chondrocyte-like  cells that produce tissue-nonspecific  alkaline phosphatase, which promotesthe calcium deposits(37)",

            "In acute or subacute cases, treatment should focus on alleviating pain and pain-related  shoulder disabilities. The American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (ACOEM) practice guidelines recommend ROM exercises and strengthening exercises for shoulder pain, but not general aerobic exercises(27)",
            "Conservative management includes therapeutic modalities for pain, scapulothoracic and glenohumeral ROM exercises, NSAIDs, corticosteroid injections, therapeutic ultrasound (US), ESWT, and shoulder strengthening exercises(1,2,14,30)",
            "Non-thermal  therapeutic USmay also be effective for short-term  pain management and restoration of function, particularly in the resorptive phase of CT \u2013Based on a double-blind  randomized trial in Austria(22) \u2013Participants included 63 individuals (70 shoulders), of whom 54 individuals (61 shoulders) finished the trial \u2013Thirty-two  shoulders in the ultrasound-treatment  group and 29 in the sham-treatment  group  \u2013US treatment parameters were: -frequency: 0.89 MHz -intensity: 2.5 W/cm2 -mode: pulsed 1:4 -duration: 15 minutes -24 total treatments \u2013Significantly reduced calcium deposits and pain were found in the shoulders receiving ultrasound treatment (42% resolved, 23% improved) compared to the sham treatment (8% resolved, 12% improved) at 9-months  follow-up \u2013It should be noted that the above parameters differ from the general recommendations published in a popular reference text are(17) -frequency: 1 or 3 MHz -intensity: 1 to 2 W/cm2 -mode: continuous -duration: 10minutes",
            "UGN studies: \u2013Authors of a quasi-experimental  (no control group) trial of 106 patients with CT in Italy found that one treatment of UGN followed by one month of shoulder rehabilitation (vaguely described in article) and multidisciplinary pain management (also not well described) was considered effective for reducing pain and improving function(23) \u2013Authors of a randomized controlled trial(RCT; N = 48 patients with CT) in the Netherlands compared US-guided corticosteroid injection in the subacromial bursa versus UGN treatments. At 1-year  follow-up,  clinical and radiographic results were significantly better in the UGN group(39) \u2013Authors of a double-blinded  RCT (n = 132 patients with CT) in France compared the amount of calcific resorption afterUGN plus steroid injection with that after UGN plus saline (placebo) injection. Steroid injection improved pain more than saline at 6 weeks post-  procedure, as well as function at 3 months post-procedure.However,  the rate of resorption was not significantly different between groups at 1-year  follow-up(40)",
            "ESWT studies: \u2013Authors of a single-blind  RCT(n = 90 patients with CT) in Italy found at 6-months  follow-up  that positioning the shoulder in hyperextension and internal rotation during radial ESWT (3 sessions) was more effective for removal of calcific deposits than treatment in the neutral position(24) \u2013Authors of a 2013 systematic review found that ESWT dissolves calcifications in the shoulder, improves shoulder function, and decreases pain in patients with calcific tendinitis(28) \u2013Authors of a 2014 systematic review of 20 RCTs (n = 1,745 patients with CT) found that ESWT significantly decreased pain and improved function compared to placebo treatment(33) \u2013Authors of a prospective trial (n = 54 patients with CT) in South Korea found that UGN was more effective than ESWT for improving shoulder function and decreasing pain at 1-year  follow-up  and for reducing the mean size of calcium deposits at a mean of 23 months follow-up(34) \u2013Authors ofan RCT (N = 42 patients with CT) in Italy compared ESWT sessions followed by kinesio taping (KT) once a week for 3 weeks versus ESWT without KT applied. Both groups showed significant improvements in V AS, DASH, and SSRQ outcome measures at 4-weeks  and 12-weeks  follow-up,  but the ESWT+KT group improved more at 1-week follow-up(39) \u2013Authors of a 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis  (7 studies) concluded that UGN treatment improves subjective outcomes slightly more than ESWT(41) .
