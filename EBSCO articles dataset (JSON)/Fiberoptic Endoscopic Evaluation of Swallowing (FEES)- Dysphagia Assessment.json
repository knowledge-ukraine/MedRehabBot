            "FEES is a procedure in which a flexible fiberoptic laryngoscope is passed through the nasal cavity to visualize swallowing function from inside the pharyngeal cavity.(1,2,3) A FEES can be performed by a specially trained speech-language pathologist (SLP) or by an otolaryngologist (ENT). FEES can be completed in the clinic office, at the bedside, or wherever the patient needs to be examined(4)",
            "According to the American Speech-Language-Hearing  Association (ASHA), there are five aspects to this procedure:(2) \u2013Examination of the oropharyngeal anatomy(4) \u2013Observation of both movement and sensation of the structures located within the hypopharynx that are essential for swallowing(4) \u2013Observation of secretions and secretion management(4) \u2013Direct assessment of the swallowing ability with both food and liquid(4) \u2013Observation of the patient\u2019s response to therapeutic maneuvers and interventions intended to improve the swallow(4)"

            "Indicated in certain patients with dysphagia based on the outcome of an in-depth clinical swallowing examination (CSE)(1) \u2013An in-depth  CSE should always precede a FEES(1,5) -In a study conducted in Turkey, researchers compared the effectiveness of a CSE, FEES, and electromyographic evaluation of swallowing in identifying dysphagia. Subjects included 24 patients who had a stroke within the previous 3 months. For the CSE, patients swallowed 10 mL of water and oxygen saturation was monitored by pulse oximetry. Researchers calculated a \u201cBedside Dysphagia Score\u201d by giving patients a point for each sign/symptom of dysphagia observed during the CSE (0\u20132 was considered normal swallow; 3\u20136was considered dysphagia). Researchers found that a BDS of 3+ was positively correlated with dysphagia identified by the FEES  and the electromyographic evaluations. Researchers concluded that the CSE was as effective in identifying dysphagia post stroke as the FEES and electromyographic evaluations; however, they concluded that best practice for adequately evaluating the nature of dysphagia was to perform a combination of a CSE and an instrumental examination(35) -In a study conducted in Denmark, researchers found that a FEES was not superior to a clinical, noninstrumental examination of swallowing (i.e., CSE) in identifying dysphagia in terms of the number of cases of aspiration pneumonia that developed in a group of patients with acquired brain injury (i.e., stroke, traumatic brain injury, anoxia).(36) Over the course of 2 years, 138 patients from a national neurorehabilitation center were randomized to a FEES assessment group or a Facial-Oral  Tract Therapy (FOTT) assessment group. FOTT is a comprehensive program that provides a structured assessment and treatment for disturbances of facial muscles, speech-  and swallowing-related jaw movements, breathing, swallowing, and the voice. The FOTT assessment is a clinical, noninstrumental examination of swallowing. Decision to initiate oral intake for these patients was based entirely on the single assessment; none of these patients had both types of swallowing assessments. Of the 138 patients included in the study, 16 developed pneumonia (4 FOTT/12 FEES); however, nine were excluded from analysis because six developed pneumonia before oral intake was initiated, and three had a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia but no radiological signs. Of the seven included in analysis, three patients assessed by FOTT and four patients assessed by FEES developed aspiration pneumonia. For this reason, researchers concluded that there was no significant difference between the FOTT and FEES assessments in ability to identify dysphagia; however, the sample size was very small, resulting in low sensitivity(36) -In a study conducted in the United States, seven SLPs who were considered experts in dysphagia were asked to watch videos of CSEs, as well as videos of FEES results, and make recommendations based on these videos. The researcher found that there was no agreement between the CSE and FEES ratings with respect to pharyngeal and laryngeal anatomy and physiology or the characteristics of pharyngeal dysphagia, when present. Additionally, the researcher found that despite being unable to accurately determine the safety of the pharyngeal swallow in 60% of the CSE videos, the SLP still made a recommendation for an oral diet in 25% of these cases. The researcher who conducted this study strongly cautioned SLPs against making a determination about swallowing safety and appropriate oral diet in patients with pharyngeal dysphagia without completing an instrumental examination(39) -In a retrospective study conducted in New Zealand with the records from 440 patients who had been admitted to an inpatient stroke unit in an urban hospital, researchers found that evaluation of patients by FEES resulted in improved outcomes. There were two groups of patients that were analyzed: 220 who were admitted before FEES was introduced as a diagnostic measure for dysphagia and 220 who were admitted after the implementation of an SLP-led FEES program at the hospital. Researchers used the incidence of pneumonia as a primary outcome measure. Medical records indicated that patients were significantly less likely to develop pneumonia following the implementation of the SLP-led FEES program(40) \u2013For detailed information on an in-depth  CSE, see Clinical Review\u2026Dysphagia Assessment: In-depth  Bedside Swallow Examination (Adults) ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T709037 and Clinical Review\u2026Dysphagia Assessment: In-depth Bedside Swallow Examination (Pediatrics) ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T709064",

For 11 other anatomical locations included in the study questionnaire, clinicians reported being able to see these with significantly different frequencies between the MBSS and FEES videos. Better visualization on the FEES was reported for the interarytenoid space, posterior pharyngeal wall, pyriform sinuses, and laryngeal structures. Additionally, pharyngeal residue was visualized more frequently and reported with greater severity on the FEES videos.

Participants first underwent a FEES without anesthetic, followed bya FEES with anesthetic, and swallows were rated according to the PAS. Any patients whose scores were 8 (i.e., theworst possible score) on the nonanesthetized trial were excluded from the anesthetized trial because there would be noway to determine if their swallow function was poorer in the second condition. Researchers found that the differencein PAS scores were not statistically significant in the anesthetized and nonanesthetized conditions.
