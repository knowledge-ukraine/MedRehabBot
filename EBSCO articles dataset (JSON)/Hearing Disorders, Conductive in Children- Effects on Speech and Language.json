A minimum of two productions of a sound is required before the sound can be credited to the phonetic inventoryStandardized tests or informal (nonstandardized) analyses can be used to determine speech errors that have a high frequency of occurrence, are early developing, and are functionally important for the child and the child\u2019s family. For specific sounds, the percentage of omissions, substitutions, distortions, and additions can be completed. A conversational sample can be used to record any difficulties in prosody, fluency, or resonance (e.g., hypernasality)Scales to measure speech intelligibility in children with hearing loss have been found to be quick to administer, discriminative, and reliable. In one method, children are asked to name pictures, and an unfamiliar listener can rate the intelligibility of each word on a scale (e.g., poor, pass, fair, good). Scales can also be analogue for quick numerical calculations (e.g., 1\u201310,  \u201cSpeech is completely intelligible\u201d[1] to \u201cSpeech is completely unintelligible\u201d[10])(15)Standardized tests can be used to classify and quantify phonological processes (patterns relating to sound errors). Children with hearing impairment often produce predictable error sound patterns (e.g., final consonant deletion)Methods to assess production capacity at the word level can include imitation, key positions (phonetic environment in which the target sound is successfully pronounced), key words (a  word or a limited number of words in which a sound is successfully pronounced), and phonetic placement and shaping (techniques that physically direct a person to the correct production of a target sound) -For detailed information on assessment of speech (articulation) skills in children with conductive hearing loss, seeArticulation Disorder, Organic ; Topic ID Number \u2013Language -If receptive and/or expressive language difficulties are suspected, provide a screening measure or a comprehensive language assessment (language sample and standardized tests) to assess expressive and receptive vocabulary and morphosyntactic language.

Sixty-five  Dutch children were assessed as part of the study. Authors concluded that there was no evidence of long-term  effects of early otitis media (in the first 2 years of life) and subsequent hearing loss on language skills in the school years. Authors caution that the sample size was limited and suggest a need for further study in this area(47) -Standardized tests can be used to assess phonology, vocabulary, syntax, and phonological awareness. It is important to note the population on which the test was standardized. Tests that are designed specifically for children who are deaf or hard of hearing are often standardized only on children who are also deaf or hard of hearing; therefore, the scores will not reflect the child\u2019s performance with regard to the \u201cmainstream\u201d population(7) -For detailed information on assessment and treatment of language disorders in children, see the series of Clinical Reviews on this topicStandardized and criterion-referenced  tests can be used to assess academic performance in reading and writingIf the child is at risk for reading difficulties and is of appropriate age, assess phonological awareness (knowledge about the sound structure of language at the syllabic, intra-syllabic,  and phonemic levels) by use of a standardized test -For detailed information on reading disabilities in children, see the series of Clinical Reviews on this topic",

            "Treatment for hearing loss \u2013Temporary conductive hearing loss due to OME is very common among children and usually resolves spontaneously.(2) Audiological treatment for OME has included early monitoring, use of nasal or oral decongestants, and antibiotics. Surgical treatment might include myringotomy (surgical incision of the eardrum), grommet insertion, or ossicular reconstruction.(50) The optimal treatment for chronic OME remains controversial, with insufficient data to firmly establish the effectiveness of any single surgical or medical treatment.(17) Meta-analyses  have indicated that the effects of grommets (ventilation tubes) on hearing, effusion duration, language development, cognition, and behavior in children are marginal at best.(18) Poor speech perception in noise has been recommended as an indicator of children who would benefit from surgical intervention(53) \u2013There is much controversy regarding the long-term  effects of OME on a child\u2019s speech and language development, with most studies indicating that OME in itself is not a substantial risk factor for speech and language problems.(19) However, OME and resulting conductive hearing loss associated with other disorders might increase the risk for greater speech and language delays than would be expected for a given condition (e.g., Turner\u2019s syndrome, cleft palate)(6) \u2013Other methods of amplification for children with conductive hearing loss might include the use of a bone-anchored hearing aid (BAHA) if the child qualifies.(20) BAHAs, placed while the child is under general anesthesia, involve placing a titanium screw into the mastoid bone. BAHAs are not placed in children younger than age 4 or 5 because the skin is too thin prior to this age(52) -Authors of a systematic review and economic evaluation of BAHAs performed in the United Kingdom concluded that BAHAs were unlikely to be more cost-effective  for adults and children who were bilaterally deaf compared with other available hearing aid options for amplification(42) -In a retrospective study with 17 children in the United Kingdom with unilateral conductive hearing loss, researchers found significant improvement in overall quality of life within this group of children after they received a bone-anchored  hearing aid(46)",
            "Early intervention \u2013Goal: The first purpose of early intervention is to help families of children with hearing loss understand the implications of hearing loss (e.g., language learning, specialized equipment, educational placement). Several studies conducted in the United Kingdom and the United States have demonstrated the benefits of family-focused early intervention on the development of communication and reading abilities in children with hearing loss.(21,22) An SLP might be involved in an early intervention team for children with conductive hearing loss who also have developmental disabilities and/or delays in speech and language. The following are suggestions for parents to promote their child\u2019s language learning: -Talk to your child about familiar things at face level(6) -Talk to your child throughout the day (e.g., mealtimes, bath time)(6) -Ask simple questions and encourage your child to respond(6) -Use expansions (repeat what your child says and add more words)(6) -Take your child to new places (e.g., supermarket) and talk about the things that you see there(6) -Talk to your child about events in the past, events that are happening in the present, and events that will happen in the future(6) -Read often to your child and make links to the child\u2019s own experiences(6) -Provide your child with books, crayons, and drawing implements(6) -Talk about sounds and names of letters(6)",
            "Speech/articulation intervention: The primary purpose of speech/articulation intervention is to improve speech intelligibility. Goals might include increasing phonetic and phonemic repertoires, correcting error sounds, establishing clear links between speech perception and speech production, and improving suprasegmental aspects of speech (e.g., prosody).(22) There is also evidence from an Australian study suggesting that training in speech production can result in improvements in vocabulary knowledge(23)  \u2013Intervention (Ling model for speech intervention) -Goal: Increase accuracy of speech production. The Ling speech program provides assessment and instructional techniques for improving speech first at the phonetic level (in nonmeaningful contexts such as sounds and syllables) and then at the phonological level (in meaningful words, phrases, sentences, and discourse). Instruction emphasizes daily drill and practice and follows a hierarchy based on ease of production and ease of speech reading. Strategies emphasize the optimal use of the student\u2019s residual and aided hearing (e.g., cochlear implant or hearing aids) by focusing on listening and auditory discrimination. Kinesthetic or auditory prompts can be used but are eventually faded.(24) The efficacy of the Ling model has been explored in single-group  studies conducted in the United States and Canada, and results from a study in Australia indicate that this method leads to generalization of treated sounds at the phonological level and can lead to improvement of some untreated sounds(25,26,27) \u2013Simultaneous phonological and morphological training -Goal: Increase speech perception, grammatical performance, and phonology. In a two-group  study conducted in Australia, researchers examined the differential effects of phonological training and morphological training. Seventeen students with hearing loss (ages 5\u201311  years), 10 with cochlear implants and 7 with hearing aids, were divided into two groups and were trained daily for 9 weeks (15\u201320 minutes daily) using one method and then the other method for the next 9 weeks. Phonological training focused on the production of four sounds (/s, z, t, d/) in the final position of words. Results indicated that both training methods led to increased morphological knowledge and speech perception but minimal gains in phonology (speech production). Researchers concluded that the training was too short to result in significant changes in speech production and that both types of training were required for maximum benefit(28)",
            "Comprehension/listening: Children with hearing aids benefit from an environment with reduced background noise. Auditory training has been used as a method to increase residual hearing ability in children who have hearing aids \u2013Environmental modifications -Goal: Reduce adverse acoustic conditions. Classroom modifications that can help to enhance listening include use of barrier walls for small group activities, use of sound-absorbing  materials such as carpet and draperies, acoustic ceiling tiles, tennis balls on chair legs in rooms without carpet, and seating away from noise (e.g., air conditioners, overhead projectors, doorways, windows)(29) \u2013Auditory training -Goal: Improve auditory perception and residual hearing ability. Auditory training is a process for training a person with hearing loss to make use of his or her residual hearing by using activities that focus on increasing the recognition, identification, and interpretation of sound. There is little experimental research on the efficacy of auditory training in children, but the research done in adults and preliminary research in children suggest that auditory training might be beneficial in increasing awareness of acoustic differences and recognizing fine acoustic distinctions(30,31)",
            "Language: Examples of language goals for children who have delayed language due to hearing loss include increasing understanding of complex units of discourse (such as sentences), building vocabulary and world knowledge, developing verbal reasoning skills, acquisition of pragmatic and syntactic rules of the language, and developing narrative skills(22) \u2013Computer-based  training -Goal: Increase vocabulary knowledge. In a multiple baseline study conducted in the United States, researchers examined the effects of a computer program in teaching vocabulary to 8 participants with hearing loss (ages 6\u201310  years). Seven wore bilateral hearing aids and 1 had a unilateral cochlear implant. Participants were tested and trained 20\u201330  minutes a day, 2 days a week for 10 weeks on 24 words (nouns) that were chosen to suit the needs of individual participants. Results indicated that all 8 participants learned all target words and retained the majority of the words 4 weeks after intervention(32) \u2013Narrative intervention -Goal: Narrative production. In a single-group  study conducted in the United States, researchers examined the effects of a narrative intervention on narrative production on 14 children (ages 7\u201314  years). Two subjects had mild hearing loss and the remaining had moderately severe to profound hearing loss. Four of these children had cochlear implants and the rest used hearing aids. Children listened to repeated readings of two books and were divided into two groups to role-play  one of the two stories. Results indicated that the complexity of the story retellings increased with role-play(33) \u2013Auditory-verbal  approach -Goal: Global language progress. In a single-group study conducted in the United States, researchers examined the language growth of 40 children with moderate to profound hearing loss (mean age, 44 months) who received 1 to 4 years of intensive auditory-verbal  intervention. Auditory-verbal therapy (A VT) emphasizes the development of spoken  language through early identification of hearing loss, amplification, and intensive speech and language therapy in which parents serve as important language models. In this study, parents and children participated in 1 or 2 hours of weekly A VT sessions. Results indicated that mean language receptive and expressive growth rates improved steadily over the 4-year  period, at times at rates faster than expected for chronological age growth(34) -Authors of another study conducted in Australia examined the effects of A VT on language and speech production over 9 months by comparing a treatment group of 29 children with moderate to profound hearing loss who used cochlear implants or hearing aids to a control group of 29 children with normal hearing. Children were matched for language age, receptive vocabulary, sex, and parental education level. Results indicated that both groups made similar gains on standardized speech and language measures after 9 months(35)",
            "Literacy: There is some evidence that recurrent OME can result in later phonological and reading difficulties.(36) Researchers have suggested that disruption of input in development can result in poorer speech perception, leading to poor phonological awareness. For children with severe and profound hearing loss, literacy goals are often addressed by both the SLP and a deaf education teacher. Specific studies on effective literacy instructional methods for these children with conductive hearing loss are lacking \u2013Phonics-based  reading curriculum and visual phonics -Goal: Increase decoding and reading comprehension. The efficacy of a systematic phonics instruction curriculum used in combination with Visual Phonics, a system of hand cues and written symbols to represent individual phonemes, has been investigated in several studies conducted in Australia and the United States. Results indicate that students from kindergarten to middle school with various degrees of hearing loss showed significant improvements on standardized tests of reading skills using these methods(37,38,39) .
