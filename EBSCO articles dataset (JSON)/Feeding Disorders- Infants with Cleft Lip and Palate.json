            "Cleft lip and palate are birth defects that affect the upper lip and the palate (roof of the mouth). A cleft lip is a separation of the two sides of the lip. The separation can include the bones of the upper jaw and/or upper gum.(1) A cleft palate is an opening that results from the two sides of the palate not fusing together as the fetus is developing.(1) An infant can have a cleft lip, cleft palate, or both; each of these defects can be unilateral or bilateral. Feeding issues for infants with cleft lip and/or palate will vary from minimal for infants with cleft lip alone to severe for infants with cleft palate combined with multiple other anomalies(1)"

Aspects of sucking behavior are classified as normal, disorganized, or dysfunctional(12)Rating scale that examines swallowing and voice in children up to 2 years of age. Ratings include duration of the meal, amount of intake, food consistencies, positioning, sucking from a nipple, sipping from a cup, and coordination of suck-swallow-breath(13)Lip, cheek, tongue, and jaw movements are rated during a typical meal. This scale can be used with children from 1 year of age through adulthood(14)A statistically based protocol for patients who are dependent feeders.

Assessment of sipping from a cup, coughing, gagging, and hypersensitivity associated with feeding and swallowing. A checklist allows for indication of abnormal oral structures, oral reflexes, positioning, diet, utensils, and feeding(16)In-depthT709064FEES is performed to evaluate the anatomy and physiology of the pharynx and the larynx, pharyngeal swallow function, and the patient\u2019s ability to manage secretions and swallow foods and liquids.(17) In addition, it can be used to explore a variety of interventions to determine effectiveness, such as varying bolus consistency, varying posture, or making use of visual feedback for reinforcement.(37) After the insertion of the endoscope, the patient can engage in normal feeding behavior during the evaluation. Food must be light in color to enhance visibility (e.g., milk, puddings, yogurt, bread). FEES is preferred over VFSS in children due to the potential harmful effects of ionizing radiation.

            "Guidelines \u2013The following is a summary of the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine\u2019s clinical guidelines for breastfeeding infants with cleft lip and/or palate: -Mothers of infants with cleft lip and/or palate should be encouraged to give their child breast milk because of its protective benefits. Evidence suggests that breastfeeding can protect against otitis media, which is extremely prevalent among these infants(26) -Breast milk feeding (via breast, cup, spoon, or bottle) is recommended over artificial milk feeding. Additionally, there is preliminary evidence regarding the possible benefits of breastfeeding over bottle feeding for the development of the oral cavity in infants with cleft lip and/or palate(26) -Mothers of infants with cleft lip and/or palate should be educated about likely breastfeeding success. In cases in which it is unlikely that direct breastfeeding will the sole feeding method, the need for supplementing with bottled or spoon-fed breastmilk should be encouraged, as well as delayed transitioning to breastfeeding when appropriate(26) -Infants with cleft lip and/or palate should be evaluated for breastfeeding capability on an individual basis. Factors such as size and location of the baby\u2019s oral cleft as well as the mother\u2019s preferences and previous experience with breastfeeding will affect breastfeeding outcomes. There is moderate-level  evidence to suggest that infants with cleft lip are able to generate suction as well as case reports that suggest that these infants often breastfeed successfully. There is also moderate evidence that infants with cleft palate or cleft lip and palate will have difficulty generating suction or  have inefficient sucking patterns. In general, the success of breastfeeding with infants with oral clefts is lower than with infants with typical oral anatomy(26) -Support for a breastfeeding mother is essential regardless of the infant\u2019s cleft status. If a mother wants to breastfeed she should have immediate access to a lactation specialist to help with positioning, management of milk supply, and pumping milk for supplemental feedings. Multiple studies have suggested that the mother of an infant with a cleft lip and/or palate needs and benefits from having access to a healthcare professional who specializes in oral clefts (e.g., nurse specialist, pediatric specialist, lactation consultant with this specialty)(26) -Families of children with cleft lip and/or palate might benefit from peer support with respect to breastmilk feeding or breastfeeding and should be referred to local, national, and international support groups(26) -Hydration and weight gain should be monitored closely in an infant with cleft lip and/or palate, especially as the method of feeding is first being established. If the child\u2019s levels of hydration or weight gain are deemed inadequate it is important to determine an appropriate supplemental feeding plan as soon as possible(26) -The following modifications to breastfeeding positions are recommended; however, they are based on weaker evidence (clinical expertise/expert opinion) and should be evaluated on an individual basis for each patient to determine appropriateness and effectiveness: -Cleft lip only -The infant should be held so that the cleft lip is positioned toward the top of the breast (e.g., an infant with a right-side  cleft lip might feed more efficiently in a cross-cradle  position at the right breast, but in a \u201cfootball hold\u201d position at left breast)(26) -When feeding an infant with a cleft lip, it might help to occlude the cleft with the mother\u2019s finger or support the infant\u2019s cheeks to narrow the cleft and promote closure of the lips around the nipple(26) -For bilateral clefts on the lip, a \u2018\u2018face on\u2019\u2019 straddle position is often the most effective breastfeeding positions(26) -Cleft lip or cleft lip and palate: -The infant should be positioned in a semi-upright  way to reduce nasal regurgitation and reflux of breastmilk into the eustachian tubes -The football hold position typically is more effective than a cross-cradle  position; it might also be helpful to position the breast toward the side of the palate that has the most intact bone to facilitate better compression and prevent the nipple from being pushed into the cleft -Some experts recommend jaw stabilization to help the infant stay latched on to the breast -For large cleft palates, some experts recommend positioning the breast downward to prevent the nipple from being pushed into the cleft -Manual expression of the milk and then placing the milk into the infant\u2019s mouth with a spoon or dropper might be necessary if suction/compression is impossible given the size and location of the cleft(26) -Caution should be used when recommending a prosthesis for orthopedic alignment presurgery as there is strong evidence that prostheses do not increase the effectiveness of breastfeeding(26) -When the infant has an uncomplicated cleft palate repair, breastfeeding can recommence one day after surgery(26) -For infants with cleft lip and/or palate as a feature of an underlying syndrome, it is important to consider the individual features of the child\u2019s syndrome when determining if breastfeeding is safe and appropriate(26)",
            "In a systematic review of the effects of various feeding interventions on the growth and development of infants with cleft lip, cleft palate, or cleft lip and palate, reviewers examined research up to October 2010 and analyzed the results of 5 RCTs involving a total of 292 babies.(3)Review authors compared squeezable versus rigid feeding bottles, breastfeeding versus spoon-feeding, and maxillary plate versus no plate. They concluded the following: \u2013Squeezable bottles appear to be easier to use than rigid feeding bottles; however, no difference in growth outcomes was found for bottle type \u2013Following surgery for cleft lip, there is evidence that breastfeeding is better than spoon-feeding \u2013No evidence was found that maxillary plate usage assists growth in babies with clefts of the palate \u2013No trials were identified that investigated the effects of additional maternal support or advice during breastfeeding",
            "Maternal advice and support \u2013Authors of a review of research on feeding interventions for infants with cleft palate found that there is some evidence that parent counseling (e.g., feeding technique instruction, lactation support, nutrition counseling) is associated with better outcomes, such as increased infant weight gain.(2) Consult with a lactation specialist to assist with breastfeeding  counseling. Aspects of counseling include advice on positioning, bottle use, feed duration, recognizing infant feeding cues, and breastfeeding techniques. Many mothers might not be able to breastfeed the infant, and the cleft palate team must be sensitive to the feelings of the mother with regard to the inability to breastfeed \u2013Researchers in the United Kingdom investigated factors that affected feeding in infants with cleft palate with or without cleft lip in a mixed-methods  study that incorporated the use of diaries to record feeding patterns as well as a measure of weight velocity over a 6-week  period.(24) Dependent measures included a V AS to assess mothers\u2019 perceptions of their children and themselves as well as the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Score (EPDS). They found that the type of bottle did not influence weight and that the most significant effect on weight was cleft type. Infants with larger clefts fed for longer periods and were slower to gain weight. Poor weight gain by the infant was associated with a mother\u2019s low perception of herself and depression. Mothers with infants with visible clefts received higher levels of social support and indicated lower levels of depression. The researchers emphasized that mothers with infants with isolated cleft palate (without cleft lip) need as much support as those parents with children with both cleft lip and palate \u2013In a study conducted in Norway with 12 mothers of infants with cleft lip and/or palate, researchers found that the two most frequently reported themes that emerged from their interviews were wanting to be a \u201ccapable and good mother\u201d and having to cope with the challenges of feeding their child. All of the mothers reacted with great concern at the time of cleft diagnosis and reported that counseling and support from healthcare professionals with expertise in the area of oral clefts was extremely helpful. Despite the help and education these mothers did receive, almost all of them reported that they would have benefitted from additional intervention, support, and counseling. The mothers also reported that they required this support from the time of initial diagnosis until feeding became more manageable; this timeline varied greatly from infant to infant(29) \u2013Some principles for feeding specific to an infant with cleft palate include: -After or during feeding, the infant might sneeze or cough because of fluid in the nasal passages. Nasal regurgitation is not dangerous, and sneezing and coughing allow the infant to clear the nasal passages(20) -An infant with cleft palate might need to be burped more often because of air that is ingested while feeding(20) -Holding the infant in a more upright position will help to prevent nasal regurgitation(20)",
            "Modified bottles and/or nipples:  Some specialized bottles and nipples can allow the feeder to assist with fluid flow during feeding for infants with cleft palate: \u2013Compressible bottles allow the milk flow to be controlled by the feeder. One example of this type of bottle is the Enfamil Cleft Lip/Palate Nurser by Mead Johnson.(20) The bottle should be squeezed in a pulsing manner in rhythm with the infant\u2019s sucking rhythm (squeeze when the infant is sucking).(20) These have been used with infants who are unable to generate suction to extract fluid independently(2) \u2013Crosscut nipples have been used with rigid or compressible bottles. Some researchers caution against the use of artificial nipples that increase the flow of milk because rapid flow may prevent the infant from developing synchronized sucking, swallowing, and breathing(2) \u2013The SpecialNeeds (formerly called Haberman) Feeder by Medela has a one-way  valve between the bottle and the nipple that allows for adjustment of three different flow rates (e.g., no/slow, medium, high). The reservoir (nipple area) is squeezed by the feeder when the infant sucks(2) \u2013The Pigeon bottle made by Respironics is a bottle that has a one-way  flow valve. Milk flow is adjusted by the tightness of the nipple collar on the bottle rather than by the feeder(20)",
            "Obturating plates:  An obturating plate (also called obturator) is an acrylic (or vinyl) appliance used to assist with feeding until corrective surgery can be performed by occluding the cleft in the palate between the mouth and the nose.(3,36) There has been limited scientific research investigating the effectiveness of palatal prostheses for feeding \u2013Authors of a review of 26 articles (including randomized controlled trials, case series, and expert advice) published in 2014 sought to determine the efficacy of obturators as well as other interventions for feeding problems in infants with cleft palate. Authors concluded that it is unlikely that one single intervention (e.g., an obturator) will be sufficient to address all the feeding needs of any given child with a cleft palate. The research reviewed indicated that multiple interventions are necessary for each child and might include an obturator, specialized bottles, lactation consultation, and breast milk pumping(34) \u2013Authors of a case study from India with 2 infants with cleft lip and palate (ages 2 days and 1 month) reported on the fabrication and use of palatal obturators\u2014one of thermoplastic resin and the other of autopolymerizing acrylic resin\u2014to  improve feeding abilities. Both infants were reported to have immediate, successful feedings immediately after placement of the obturators(32)",
            "Cup feeding:  Cup feeding has been used to complement breastfeeding. This method has not been sufficiently examined to determine its usefulness for infants with cleft palate(2) \u2013In a study conducted in Brazil with 44 children (ages 11 to 18 months) who were in the immediate postoperative period after palatoplasty for cleft palate, researchers compared the use of a spoon and a cup for feeding during this time.(33) Prior to the palatoplasty, the children had been fed by bottle. During the immediate postoperative period, researchers found that spoon use was associated with less anterior bolus loss, more food acceptance, and fewer coughing episodes in children who underwent total palatoplasty.(33) Researchers concluded that immediately postoperatively, children who undergo palatoplasty should be fed by a spoon rather than a cup(33)",
            "Paladai feeding :Paladai feeding is another method for feeding an infant with difficulty breast and bottle feeding. Paladai feeding involves feeding a child expressed breast milk (or formula) using a paladai (a small bowl-shaped  feeding device with a pointed spout on one side). Although this method is often faster and less messy than spoon or cup feeding, it can result in large amounts of milk being poured into the baby\u2019s mouth, increasing the risk of aspiration(35) \u2013In a study conducted in India with 150 2-month-old  infants with cleft lip and palate, researchers compared weight gain from three different feeding methods over the course of 10 months. Infants in this study were either spoon fed, bottle fed, or paladai fed and weight gain was tracked every other month until their first birthday. Researchers found that the weight gain for the paladai feeding group was significantly higher than that of either the spoon or bottle-fed group(35) .
