            "Postoperative active motion following extensor tendon reconstruction can improve functional outcomes in patients with RA who have sustained spontaneous extensor tendon rupture(12) \u2013Based on a prospective study conducted in Japan in which subjects with RA underwent extensor tendon reconstruction surgery with arthroplasty or arthrodesis \u2013Mean age of the patients was 52.6 years and 66 wrists were included in the study \u2013Forty-six  wrists (69.6%) had \u201cgood\u201d results, while 13 (19.7%) and 7 (10.6%) wrists had \u201cfair\u201d and \u201cpoor\u201d results, respectively \u2013Using multiple regression analysis, the number of ruptured tendons and the patient\u2019s age were both independent variables that significantly correlated with the results of tendon reconstruction \u2013Single regression analysis also showed a significant association between the number of ruptured tendons and surgical delay",
            "The authors of a systematic review comparing two active motion protocols for zone IV and V injuries, controlled active motion and relative motion extension splinting, found that both protocols resulted in similar ROM outcomes, but that the patients treated using relative motion extension splinting returned to work earlier and had no increase in complications(16)",
            "Complications can occur following injury and surgical repair. Some complications to consider (by zone) include:(14) \u2013zone I (patients undergoing open reduction and internal fixation of fracture with associated tendon disruption)\u2014infection (including osteomyelitis), nail deformity, joint malalignment, implant failure, pain \u2013zone II (patients undergoing primary repair of the tendon)\u2014infection, rupture of the repaired tendon; chronic zone II injuries may require reconstruction of the spiral oblique retinacular ligament \u2013zone III (patients undergoing central slip repair)\u2014tendon adhesions, joint capsule tightness, extension lag, development of a boutonniere deformity \u2013zones (V\u2013VII)\u2014infection,  adhesion formation and decreased tendon gliding, tendon gapping, repair failure "
        ],
        "treatment summary": [
            "In the acute stage, the treatment goals are to protect the repair, prevent tendon adhesion formation, decrease stiffness, and control edema.(13) While healing, unprotected repairs can rupture or gap. In the subacute stage, the goal is to increase ROM. In the later stages, increasing strength and improving hand function are the primary goals",
            "Several different protocols exist for progression of motion following extensor tendon repair. Researchers have defined the early motion techniques differently. For the purposes of this paper, early controlled motion technique refers to the technique in which a dynamic orthosis is used to allow early active flexion and passive extension; this may also be called early passive motion (EPM). Early active motion (EAM) technique refers to the technique in which an orthosis that allows active flexion and extension is used and includes relative active motion(5,9,16,22)",
            "Rehabilitation for tendon transfers typically follows similar patterns as for repairs, with the addition of requiring additional training for functional use. The treating therapist should follow the surgeon\u2019s protocol for rehabilitation",
            "Close communication with the hand surgeon is required to attain vital information about the location and strength of the repair as well as treatment guidelines",
            "Immobilization \u2013Total immobilization (no PROM or AROM) of the hand is the most frequently selected postoperative protocol for repairs of zones I and II.(3)Immobilization may also be appropriate for noncompliant patients or for the pediatric population, regardless of the zone of injury \u2013Zones III and IV(10) -Displaced closed avulsion fractures at the base of the middle phalanx, axial and lateral instability of the PIP joint with loss of joint motion, and failed nonoperative treatment with splinting are indications for surgical intervention -Acute open injuries require primary surgical repair -Postoperative rehabilitation emphasizes early protected motion. The finger is immobilized in a PIP joint gutter orthosis. The orthosis is to be removed every hour so the patient can perform guarded AROM exercises that provide optimal gliding of the extensor mechanism -Rehabilitation and orthosis use are similar for zones III and IV(10) -DIP and PIP joint neutral orthosis at 24 to 48 hours postoperatively, with exercise hourly -0\u20132 weeks post-surgery:  Orthosis 1 allows for 30\u02da of PIP joint and 25\u02da of DIP joint ROM. Orthosis 2 is used for PIP neural joint alignment and active DIP joint flexion -2\u20133 weeks post-surgery:  If no extensor lag is present, orthosis 1 is used to increase PIP joint flexion to 40\u02da and orthosis 2 is still used to maintain PIP neutral joint alignment and active DIP joint flexion -4\u20135 weeks post-surgery:  If no extensor lag is present, orthosis 1 is used to increase PIP joint flexion to 40\u02da and orthosis 2 continues to be used to maintain PIP neutral joint alignment and active DIP joint flexion -6 weeks post-surgery:  If no extensor lag is present, discontinue the use of orthoses. Allow for full active PIP and DIP joint flexion -For the entire 6 weeks, daily removal of orthoses for wound care and the use of a compressive wrap for edema control is allowed \u2013Immobilization for zone V -In zone V , closed injuries or injuries with less than 50% involvement can be managed with MCP extension splinting. Wrist in 30 to 45\u02da of extension, MCP 20 to 30\u02da of flexion and PIP free for 4\u20135 weeks -Complete immobilization for 3 weeks may be appropriate for children, noncompliant or impulsive patients, and patients with impaired cognition. Some postoperative protocols call for up to 6 weeks of uninterrupted immobilization(3) \u2013Immobilization versus EAM zone V to VII(18) -In a randomized trial designed to assess outcomes of immobilization versus EAM following extensor tendon repair in zones V , VI, or VII,patients in the immobilization group were positioned in a static splint (wrist 30\u02da extension, interphalangeal joints 0\u02da) for 4 weeks, followed by allowing 45\u02da of motion at the MCP joint and full IP joint motion. The motion was increased to 90\u02daat 6 weeks. Splint was discontinued at 8 weeks after surgery. In the early mobilization group, beginning post op day 1 or 2 the protective splint was modified to include only the wrist and involved digit(s). Day 3 or 4, 0\u201330\u02da  of MCP ROM was initiated and increased to 0\u201350\u02da  week 2 post surgery, and continued to be increased weekly, allowing 90\u02da of flexion at week 4 post surgery. Unrestricted digit motion was allowed in the 5th or 6th week -Patients in the early mobilization group had better ROM and less pain at 12-week  follow-up ",
            "Early controlled motion technique \u2013For repairs of zones V and VI there are several different treatment protocols in published literature. The protocols differ relative to the splint design (e.g., wrist position, number of digits included). Some protocols include a dynamic orthosis applied postoperatively that maintains the wrist in extension and allows 30\u201340\u00b0  of active MCP flexion and provides passive extension to 0\u00b0. Typically a night resting orthosis is also used(17) \u2013Early controlled motion and dynamic orthoses generally are not recommended for patients with a tendon rupture secondary to RA(3) \u2013The use of a dynamic passive mobilization orthosis to manage zone II extensor tendon injuries can limit DIP joint stiffness and the development of an extensor lag -Based on a case study conducted in Qatar that involved a 25-year-old  man who sustained a zone II extensor tendon injury as a result of a saw injury to his right index finger(6) -The authors describe the use of a dynamic passive mobilization program to manage the zone II extensor tendon injury in order to prevent DIP joint stiffness, which commonly develops following the use of a static orthosis. This program contrasts with the typical management using a static orthosis for 4 to 6 weeks followed by gradual increase in ROM at the DIP joint",
            "EAM \u2013EAM approaches for rehabilitation following zone V and VI extensor tendon repairs include relative motion extension (RME) orthosis and controlled active motion (CAM). There are several variations for both approaches published in the literature(5,22) \u2013Authors of an RCT comparing outcomes of RME and CAM found that both were safe (i.e., no tendon ruptures occurred) and that the RME group had earlier return to functional use, better total active movement, and higher satisfaction compared to the CAM group(5) \u2013.
