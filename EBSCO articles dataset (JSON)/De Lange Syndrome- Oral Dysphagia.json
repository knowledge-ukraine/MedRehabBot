            "Dysphagia refers to difficulty swallowing due to an inability to move food efficiently during the oral, pharyngeal, or esophageal phases of swallowing.(2) The oral phase includes sucking, chewing, and moving the food or liquid into the throat while achieving adequate lip closure. The pharyngeal phase is the initiation of the swallowing reflex, when the food is squeezed down the throat and the airway is closed off to prevent aspiration (food or liquid entering the airway) or choking. In the esophageal phase, the openings at the top and bottom of the esophagus move the food or liquid to the stomach by relaxing and tightening.(3) Symptoms of dysphagia sometimes evolve throughout the lifespan of the patient with CdLS. Infants have been reported to have oral feeding difficulties, necessitating enteral feeding. Esophageal dysphagia has been noted in adults with CdLS; Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) has been reported in up to three quarters of an adult patient sample (N = 49) in a study conducted in the United States.(4)For detailed information on dysphagia in childhood, see Clinical Review\u2026Dysphagia in Childhood ; CINAHL Topic ID Number:T708938.Clinical presentation of CdLS involves any of the following symptoms:",

Ratings include duration of the meal, amount of intake, food consistencies, positioning, sucking from a nipple, sipping from a cup, and coordination of suck-swallow-breath(18)Lip, cheek, tongue, and jaw movement are rated during a typical meal. This scale can be used with children from 1 year of age through adults(19)A VFSS is performed when the dysphagia team needs additional information about the patient\u2019s swallowing function and to rule out or identify aspiration. A VFSS is completed in collaboration with a physician  (radiologist or physiatrist).(7) Most clinical practices follow the protocol originally described by Logemann and adaptations of this protocol for infants and children described by Arvedson and Lefton-Greif.(20,21) The assessment must be age-appropriate  with regard to positioning, presentation, and viscosity of material.(7) The patient eats and drinks a variety of developmentally appropriate liquids and solids mixed with barium while images are recorded with videofluorography. All patients should be examined in the lateral and frontal positions to gain information on movements of the swallow and symmetry of bolus flow and pharyngeal wall contraction. The SLP examines for the presence of aspiration and the effectiveness of presenting different food consistencies or by modifying posture.(7) In contrast to the CSE, the VFSS provides critical information on the pharyngeal phase of the swallow.(22) Given the unnatural surroundings, swallowing function observed during a VFSS is not necessarily identical to that exhibited at mealtimes.(23) Other variables that can influence swallowing function include anxiety, fatigue, and medications.(24) Due to the harmful effects of ionizing radiation on children, a repeat VFSS should only be considered when there are specific questions that require answers from a repeat study; a VFSS should not be used frequently to monitor changes in swallowing.(25) During(24) -Lip closure (ability to contain a liquid bolus) -Lingual elevation (the back of the tongue is slightly elevated) -Tongue-to-palatal  seal -Bolus preparation/mastication -Bolus transport/movement of the tongue (movement of the bolus to the back of the oral cavity) -Initiation of the pharyngeal swallow (swallow should be initiated when the bolus reaches the region of the posterior oral cavity) -Soft palate elevation and retraction -Laryngeal elevation -Anterior hyoid excursion -Laryngeal closure -Pharyngeal contraction -Pharyngoesophageal segment opening -Tongue base retraction -Epiglottic inversion -Esophageal clearanceModifiedT709064FEES is performed to evaluate the anatomy and physiology of the pharynx and the larynx, pharyngeal swallow function, and the patient\u2019s ability to manage secretions and swallow foods and liquids.(7) In addition, it can be used to explore a variety of diagnostic interventions, such as varying bolus consistency, varying posture, or making use of visual feedback for reinforcement.(26) After the insertion of the endoscope, the patient can engage in normal feeding behavior during the evaluation. Food must be light in color to enhance visibility (e.g., milk, puddings, yogurt, bread). FEES is preferred over VFSS when patients have safety issues related to radiation exposure or when they need retesting. Due to the invasive nature of the procedure, it might be difficult to obtain an accurate representation of a normal swallow in young children.(27) The American Speech-Language-Hearing  Association (ASHA) has published several online documents relevant to the technical aspects of FEES and the qualifications required to perform FEES(28) -For detailed information on endoscopic assessment of swallowing, see the series of Clinical Reviews on this topicInfant sucking and oral transit times can be examined by ultrasonography, an instrumental procedure involving transducers that use high-frequency  sound waves to create images. In infants and children, the transducer is placed under the chin as the patient swallows liquid or food. The ultrasonographic scanner can display images of the nipple, tongue surface, hard and soft palates, and hyoid during infant feeding(7)Oximetry is used to evaluate hemoglobin oxygen saturation levels before and after feeding. Most infants have an oxygen saturation level of at least 95%. Low saturation levels (below 90%) indicate some degree of hypoxia(29)Cervical auscultation involves the use of a stethoscope on the lateral side of the thyroid cartilage to listen to sounds associated with breathing and swallowing patterns. Limitations of cervical auscultation include a lack  of normative data and clear guidelines for interpretation of the procedure. In addition, many movements associated with swallowing are silent(27) -For detailed information about cervical auscultation with pediatric patients, see Clinical Review\u2026Dysphagia",

Team management for patients with severe developmental disabilities, such as CdLS, is particularly important because dysphagia can result from multiple causes (e.g., craniofacial anomalies, GERD, effects of prolonged nasogastric tube feeding) and assessment requires expertise from many disciplines.(33) The primary concern is to maintain and maximize the patient\u2019s health status.(7) After the evaluation, a decision must be made about the patient\u2019s ability to ingest food and liquid orally(34)",

            "Nipple selection for bottle-feeding:  Nipple characteristics, such as the shape or material of the nipple and size of the hole, can be selected to influence fluid flow; however, there is little evidence to support the use of a particular type of nipple to improve bottle-feeding  performance of preterm infants, and nipples are often selected based upon personal preference and clinical experience(35)",
            "Positioning:  Newborn positioning techniques include swaddling, position aids, and use of specific positions (e.g., side lying, prone, upright position).(36) There is evidence that an upright or prone position is effective in alleviating symptoms of GERD (as compared to supine or seated positions).(14) Swaddling an infant in flexion has been suggested as a way to support infants who are motorically disorganized or hypotonic, and help facilitate better sucking, swallowing, and breathing.(14) Recommendations for infant positioning are based primarily on expert opinion and clinical experience, and a team approach (including pediatric physical and occupational therapists) for managing positioning is advised(35,36)",
            "Chin and cheek support:  To stabilize the jaw when the infant exhibits hypotonia and excessive jaw shifting, the middle finger can be placed under the chin and the index finger between the chin and lower lip during bottle-feeding.(35) Direct external support to the cheek or suck pads can be used to assist the infant in pursing lips and achieving an effective seal around the nipple. Place the thumb and middle finger or index finger on the suck pads while gently providing lateral pressure. A smaller bottle may be easier to use for this technique(37)",
            "External pacing:  External pacing or paced feeding protocols have been trialed to assist the preterm infant in coordinating breathing and sucking patterns.(35,38) Preterm infants sometimes use \u201ctransitional\u201d sucking patterns that are not coordinated with breathing. These immature sucking patterns may lead to coughing, choking, bradycardia, apnea, and fatigue during feeding. Paced feeding involves removing the nipple from the mouth after every three to five sucks to encourage 3- to 5-second  breathing pauses \u2013In a nonrandomized clinical trial conducted in the United States, researchers investigated the effects of external pacing on efficiency of sucking and weight gain, incidence of bradycardia during feeding, and length of hospital stay (N = 36).(38) Preterm infants in the treatment group received paced bottle-feeding  while infants in the control group received traditional bottle-feeding.  Infants in the treatment group demonstrated significantly less incidence of bradycardia during feeding and exhibited more efficient sucking patterns at discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU); however, time of discharge and average weekly weight gain did not differ between groups. The authors concluded that pacing is beneficial for preterm infants with respiratory disease, but cautioned that significant feeder training is necessary for this intervention (nurses received 10 hours of training to implement pacing intervention)",
            "Feeding schedules:  The two primary options for feeding schedules are responsive feeding (feeding an infant based on behaviors that indicate hunger and satiation) and scheduled interval feeding (infant is fed at scheduled times). Authors of a systematic review that included nine randomized controlled trials compared the effects of both types of feeding schedules for preterm infants and determined that there are insufficient data at present to guide clinical practice. There is some indication that responsive feeding with preterm infants leads to full oral feeding (i.e., no need for tube feed supplementation) more quickly than interval feeding; however, larger, better designed trials are necessary to confirm this finding(39)",
            "Oral sensory motor therapy/oral stimulation: Infant stimulation through use of auditory, tactile, visual, and vestibular intervention has been found to be associated with increased infant alertness (during first 5 minutes of the feeding intervention), reduced length of hospital stay, improved feeding progression, decreased apnea, more stable organization of state, increased weight gain, decreased abnormal reflexes, and better sensory and motor performance on behavioral assessments(13) \u2013Nonnutritive oral stimulation program: In a randomized trial (RCT) conducted in Canada, researchers examined the effects of a nonnutritive oral stimulation program on the feeding skills of preterm infants born at 26\u201329  weeks\u2019 gestation (N = 32). The experimental group received oral stimulation treatment that consisted of stroking the perioral and intraoral structures for 15 minutes daily for 10 days before the start of oral feedings. Infants in the control group received no oral stimulation. Outcome measures included the number of days that were required for the infant to transition from tube to full oral feedings as well as overall intake of food and rate of milk transfer. Sucking skills were also measured (maturational level of the sucking pattern, sucking frequency, and amplitudes of suction and expression). The experimental group showed significant gains over the control group in the amplitude of the expression component of sucking, resulting in faster transition to oral feedings (7 days sooner). However, there was no difference between groups in sucking stage maturation, sucking frequency, amplitude of the suction component of sucking, and endurance. Thus,  the experimental group achieved faster transition to oral feedings, but many aspects of the sucking did not appear to be affected by the treatment(40) \u2013Tactile stimulation for lingual motor function: In a retrospective study conducted in the United States of 45 children with severe dysphagia due to congenital anomalies and/or gastroenterologic dysfunction, researchers investigated a lingual shaping treatment approach that used tactile stimulation (touching the tongue with the smallest finger) to induce new lingual responses (e.g., posterior portion of the tongue rises in response to tactile stimulation). Individual lingual responses were reinforced and then chained in a series of six movements to form a complete swallow reflex. Treatment time consisted of intensive treatment (45\u201360  minutes 5\u20137x/day)  for 5\u20137 days in an inpatient setting and then 60 minutes/1x a week with parent training to generalize in the home. At 6 months\u2019 follow-up,  43 patients (96%) had independent swallows and 42 had 100% oral intake. These results were maintained at 1 and 2 years\u2019 follow-up(41) \u2013Authors of a systematic review that included 16 studies investigating the effects of oral motor exercises on swallowing in children with dysphagia concluded that there was insufficient evidence that the exercises result in functional improvement of the swallowing mechanism in children with dysphagia(42) -The most positive treatment effect was found with the 12-month  use of a stimulating oral plate for children with cerebral palsy to improve chewing(42)",
            "Liquid thickening:  Breast milk or formula is often thickened to reduce symptoms of GERD or to facilitate swallow coordination by slowing the flow rate in infants and children with dysphagia. Liquids can be thickened with pulverized powdered rice cereal in a blender and then slowly added to milk.(50) An instrumental swallow evaluation is often needed to determine the effect of the thickened liquid on swallowing(50) \u2013In a cross-sectional  exploratory study conducted in the United Kingdom, researchers used semistructured interviews to gauge parent opinion on liquid thickening for children who had required thickened liquids for at least 10 months. Subjects in the study had a variety of diagnoses (e.g., GERD, Down syndrome, global developmental delay, cerebral palsy) and ranged in age from 2 to 12 years. The major themes that the researchers identified were challenges in the early stages of using thickeners (e.g., no education about the purpose of thickeners, difficulty finding appropriate feeding equipment to use with thickeners), persistent difficulties with thickeners (e.g., lumpiness of the drinks, uncertainty about the right level of thickness), and positive benefits of thickeners (e.g., reduced lung infections, improved quality of life). Despite the problems reported, the parents in this study unanimously acknowledged the value of liquid thickeners for improving their children\u2019s quality of life and enjoyment of drinking(48)",
            "Nonnutritive sucking:  Nonnutritive sucking (NNS) refers to pacifier sucking. The rationale for NNS is to assist the infant in developing coordinated sucking behaviors in preparation for oral feeding. Authors of a systematic review examined 12 studies to determine the effects of NNS on major clinical variables for preterm infants, including length of hospital stay, transition to bottle-feeding, bottle-feeding  performance, weight gain, energy intake, heart rate, oxygen saturation, intestinal transit time, age at full oral feeds, and behavioral state.(43) The reviewers concluded that NNS led to a significantly decreased duration of hospital stay, easier transition to bottle-feeding,  and better bottle-feeding  performance. There was no consistent benefit on other clinical variables(43) \u2013Authors of a systematic review including 12 studies that examined the effects of oral motor interventions for preterm infants with feeding and swallowing difficulties (including NNS, oral/perioral stimulation, and NNS plus perioral stimulation) found that methodological quality varied significantly(44) -NNS appeared to have the most promise for clinical use; however, given the methodological limitations, it was impossible for the authors of the review to draw firm conclusions regarding the clinical application and efficacy of any of these interventions(44)",
            "Kangaroo mother care (KMC): KMC is intended to assist infants in achieving readiness for oral feeding and earlier discharge from the hospital.(13)  The primary component of KMC is skin-to-skin  contact between a parent and the newborn infant. The infant is placed in an upright position on the parent\u2019s chest as soon as he or she is medically stable. In a randomized clinical trial conducted in Canada of 488 infants, researchers compared traditional care (using an incubator until the infant was able to self-regulate  temperature) (n = 242) to KMC (n = 246).

The tubes were not kept by the caregivers for reference. In the \u201ctypical training\u201d module, caregivers were given hands-on  training about how to thicken liquids, as well as education regarding the rationale for use and were provided with the written guidelines for thickening (based on the National Descriptors of Texture Modification in Adults from the British Dietetic Association and Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists). Sixty-two  caregivers of adults with intellectual disabilities and dysphagia were randomly assigned to one of the three groups and thickening accuracy was assessed immediately pre- and post-intervention,  as well as in a 3- to 10-month follow-up  session. For all types of training, accuracy increased immediately post-intervention  and decreased in the 3- to 10-month  follow-up  session, but not to the pre-intervention  baseline level. The typical training with written guidance and typical training with TIM tubes methods resulted in significantly more accurate liquid thickening immediately after the intervention than did written guidance only, and the decrease in accuracy at 3- to 10-month  follow-up was the smallest for the group that received the typical training with TIM tubes(47)"
