            "NMO is an autoimmune disorder with features similar to multiple sclerosis (MS), most notably the occurrence of one or more clinical episodes of optic neuritis in combination with myelitis(1)",
            "In NMO, these episodes are usually more acute and severe than in MS",
            "At one time NMO was considered a severe form of MS; however, the recent discovery of a disease-specific  immunoglobulin G (NMO-IgG) seems to confirm that it is a separate disease with a distinct etiology(1) \u2013Early diagnosis (differentiation from MS) is important in order to reduce the risk of developing long-term  disability and/or death. (1) Some MS treatments have been reported to worsen NMO(17)",
