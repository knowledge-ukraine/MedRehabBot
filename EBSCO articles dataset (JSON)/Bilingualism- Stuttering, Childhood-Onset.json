            "Stuttering is characterized by primary stuttering behaviors such as repetitions, prolongations, interjections, and blocked words as well as secondary behaviors that are counterproductive adaptations that individuals might use to overcome their primary stuttering behaviors.(4,35) These symptoms can range in severity from mild to severe \u2013Primary stuttering behaviors -Repetition: A repetition can occur at the beginning of a word and be a single sound (e.g., \"D-D-D-og\"), be a part of a word (e.g., \"Cat-cat-cat-catastrophe\"),  or be a repetition of an entire word (e.g., \u201cI went to tototototo the store\u201d)(35) -Prolongations: Prolongations occur with a single sound, consonant, or vowel (e.g., \"SSSSSay that again?\")(35) -Broken words: Pauses between words(35) -Interjections: Interjections are filler words that are used when a person has difficulty moving from one word to the next (e.g., \"I'll see you um um like um at 7:00 o'clock) -Audible or silent blocking: Blocking occurs when the mouth is positioned to say the word or part of a word but the word is stopped. Blocks can last for several seconds and can be silent or filled with a sound(35) -Circumlocutions: Circumlocutions are instances when a person will talk around a word that is known to be problematic in hopes of avoiding a stuttering moment (e.g., \u201cthe place where I go every Sunday\u201d instead of \u201cchurch\u201d)(35) -Whole word repetitions (e.g., \u201cA red-red-red-red-red-red  shirt\u201d)(35) \u2013Secondary stuttering behaviors are signs of physical tension or facial expressions that indicate struggle during speaking (e.g., pursed lips, eye blinks, flapping arms, facial tension, abnormal head movements).(5,35) Secondary behaviors also include choosing alternative words to avoid certain words on which the speaker expects to stutter.(4) There is a risk that secondary behaviors will increase and grow more pronounced as a child ages(6)  \u2013Certain factors might exacerbate stuttering, including negative feelings and attitudes towards stuttering, patient-developed methods for avoiding stuttering, language difficulties, and speech motor control processes that may affect respiration, phonation, and articulatory rate(4) \u2013Research on bilingual people who stutter is limited; it is difficult to draw conclusions about the characteristics of individuals who are bilingual and stutter or what treatments are effective due to small sample sizes(39) \u2013Bilingual children and adults who stutter are most likely to stutter in both languages rather than in just one language; however, case studies have indicated that bilingual individuals may stutter more in one language than another(7) Causes, Pathogenesis, & Risk Factors"

In this study, the frequency of stuttering was higher in English, which was L2 (the language acquired second) and the less proficient language for all subjects. In both languages, these subjects stuttered on content and function words; however, significantly more stuttering moments occurred on content words in both languages. When the speech samples were evaluated separately according to language and analyzed for grammatical category, more content words were stuttered in L1 (Kannada) and function words in L2 (English). Researchers emphasized the need for clinicians to not only understand the relative proficiency of their bilingual clients who stutter, but also the phonological, lexical, and prosodic differences in the two (or more) languages spoken.

        "Speech-language  pathologists (SLPs) who work with individuals who are culturally and linguistically diverse must develop cultural competence. Culturally competent clinicians are those who: 1) simultaneously appreciate cultural patterns and individual variation, 2) engage in cultural self-scrutiny  by examining their own cultural beliefs and values, 3) embrace principles of evidence-based  practice, and 4) consider speech and language disorders within a social context(3) Whenever possible, a bilingual person should be assessed by an SLP who speaks both (or all) languages being assessed. Although beneficial, it is not necessary for an SLP to speak both languages that a person who stutters speaks in order to evaluate fluency.(37) Authors of a study conducted in New Zealand reported that 19 English-speaking  monolingual (or bilingual in a language other than Spanish) SLPs were able to accurately assess two bilingual Spanish-English  speaking adults who stuttered. Both adults were also assessed by 3 bilingual Spanish-English  speaking SLPs and the overall ratings of fluency provided by the bilingual and monolingual SLPs were not significantly different.(37) The identification and descriptions of specific types of stuttering moments within the Spanish speech sample, however, were not as well-described by the non-Spanish  speaking SLPs as they were by the Spanish-English  bilingual SLPs(37)",
        "Culture can influence an individual's attitude toward speech disfluencies as well as an individual's approach towards therapy.(13) Some cultures believe stuttering results from an emotional disturbance or is a form of punishment by a god or spiritual figure, and even within a single culture there can be wide variation of beliefs about disordered speech and communication in general. The SLP should ascertain the family's or individual's beliefs and feelings about stuttering and its causes through discussion(13) ",
        "It is important for the SLP to know the individual's history of therapy and knowledge of stuttering before beginning treatment. Many adults with chronic stuttering have participated in years of therapy and have varying levels of knowledge about stuttering and treatment strategies"

Measures of affective components regarding stuttering may have to be adapted if a patient's background and living experiences differ significantly from those listed in the inventories. A simple way to adapt is to ask the individual if the questions are relevant to his or her personal experience(13) -Speech samples for fluency analysis should be taken in all of the languages that the patient speaks on a regular basis. Individuals who stutter become more fluent with repeated readings of the same passage. Bilingual speakers have to do the same tasks twice; thus, to minimize practice effects, the SLP should counterbalance the order of the speech samples(20) -Collect a speech sample that represents the individual's speech in everyday use (e.g., interview with the individual about a recent holiday, description of the individual's job or leisure activities) as well as a speech sample in a structured activity (e.g., picture description, reading a passage aloud)(4,15) -Calculate the percentage of total disfluencies from a recorded 100-word  speech sample (total number of words containing both stuttering-like and nonstuttering disfluencies divided by the total number of words that would have been spoken without disfluencies)(4) -Calculate the percentage of stuttering-like disfluencies from a recorded or online 100-word speech sample.

This measure is more useful as a criterion-referenced  measure rather than a standardized measure as there are few reliable normative data in many languages(20) -The following signs of stuttering assist in distinguishing stuttering from normal disfluencies in English. However, these indications should be used with caution to analyze disfluency in other languages. For example, French speakers who do not stutter have been found to have twice as many stutter-like  disfluencies as English speakers of a similar age and education.(20) The SLP must use perceptual judgment and observe the speaker\u2019s level of visible tension(4) -The presence of three or more stuttering-like disfluencies such as sound repetitions, blocks, or prolongations per 100 words(4) -Blocks or prolongations account for 25% or more of total disfluencies(4) -Presence of repetitions, prolongations, or blocks occurring in adjacent sounds or syllables within a word(4) -The individual demonstrates an increase in the rate and irregularity of repetitions(4) -The individual shows signs of tension or struggle when she or he is disfluent(4) -The presence of secondary behaviors such as eye blinks, tics, or interjections before or after a disfluency(4) -The individual is frustrated or embarrassed about stuttering(4)(21) The SSI-3  quantifies stuttering severity and is intended to supplement information from patient and/or parent interviews, speech samples, and speech and language tests.

Rating scales ask the individual or individual's parents to rate the levelauditory comprehension, verbal expression, reading comprehension, and written expression (see Lim, 2008 for example).(17) Several studies have found that individuals stutter more in the language in which they are less dominant(18,19) \u2013Assess language skills through formal and informal measures if there are concerns about expressive or receptive language skills. For children, it is particularly important to determine if disfluencies are caused in part by an unbalanced or diminished language ability in one or both languages.(13) Limited proficiency in a language can cause a person to have frequent pauses and nondisordered speech disfluencies.

            "Children \u2013Research on stuttering in bilingual children is limited. There is some controversy regarding the possible negative effects of bilingualism on stuttering, with some experts advocating that the child be exposed to only one language until that language can be used successfully.(7) However, this recommendation is not supported by extensive research, and it is often impractical for bilingual families to limit a child's exposure to one language.(20) In addition, some researchers suggest that bilingualism is not necessarily a negative factor in or barrier to early stuttering treatment(27) \u2013It is recommended that stuttering therapy for young children include the parents/caregivers in treatment, and it is especially important that parents/caregivers be involved in stuttering therapy for bilingual children, particularly if the SLP does not speak the child's dominant language. Parents/caregivers should attend therapy sessions, learn fluency targets, review lessons with the child, model target-assisted  speech at home, and assist the child in completing fluency homework assignments.(28) However, it is important to note that parent-based stuttering training programs might not match the interaction style of families in some cultural groups. The SLP must first learn the family's values and beliefs relevant to communication. This is best achieved through open-ended questions requesting descriptive information (e.g., \"Please describe a typical playtime with your child.\").(29) The goal of a fluency program is typically to build on interactions that are already in place that promote fluency \u2013When treating bilingual children, the SLP must design therapy tasks that are appropriate for the child's language skills so that language pressures do not result in fluency breakdown(13) \u2013There are very few research studies that have investigated the efficacy of stuttering programs for bilingual children. Findings of research studies on the Lidcombe program, a stuttering treatment that is conducted by parents, indicate that treatment in one language transfers to gains in fluency in the other language; however, these gains are variable.(20) The success of this program in bilingual children may be due to the administration of the program at home by the parent or due to the young age of the children.(20) For more information regarding treatment of stuttering in children, see the series of Clinical Reviews on this topic",
            "Adults \u2013Research on stuttering treatment for both monolingual and bilingual adults is limited; most clinical practice is based on unverified treatment procedures. The majority of the research has focused on behavioral or fluency shaping techniques(30) \u2013Authors of a case study of a bilingual adult (English and Afrikaans) determined that the individual was more disfluent in the less proficient language. The researchers concluded that, even in adults, disfluency can result from language incompetence rather than clinical stuttering(19) \u2013In determining which language(s) to address in therapy, the SLP must consider the language that the individual uses most in daily activities and would like most to target.(20) The other language can also be targeted early in therapy; however, the  individual may have to take more responsibility for the languages not spoken by the clinician. The clinician can provide feedback on gentle onsets and use of techniques without understanding what is being said(20) \u2013Recommendations for adapting fluency-shaping  therapy to individuals who are bilingual include:(31) -Replace original stimulus materials with those that are culturally and linguistically appropriate -Modify instructions to ensure comprehension by non-native  speakers -Design and record speech samples for modeling that are in the language or dialect of the individual -Structure practice and generalization tasks to include those that are relevant to the individual's experiences \u2013People who continue to stutter into adulthood often have negative reactions and anxieties associated with speaking. Authors of a literature review of stuttering interventions for adults recommended that stuttering therapy be comprehensive and multidimensional, addressing any anxiety and other negative feelings associated with stuttering; however, treatment approaches that emphasize counseling may be culturally inappropriate for some individuals. The counseling process is based on a Eurocentric perspective that focuses on assisting people in adapting to their environment. This perspective might not be appropriate in certain cultures, and some individuals might be uncomfortable in confronting the disorder via self-disclosure  and pseudostuttering (deliberate production of primary stuttering behaviors)(31) \u2013For detailed information regarding treatment of stuttering in adults, see Clinical Review\u2026Childhood-Onset  Fluency Disorder (Stuttering): Adults ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T708943 .

This hierarchy may be dependent on place, conversational partner, and the situation (e.g., oral presentation vs. conversation)The individual will practice techniques and strategies at home.
