If the underlying cause is stroke or head injury, the prognosis is commensurate with the extent of the original brain damage \u2013 the prognosis is better for mild strokes or brain injuries. For patients with a medically treatable condition (such as Korsakoff syndrome or depression), prognosis is favorable with proper medical intervention and drug treatments.(18) However, if the underlying cause of memory deficits is a neurological degenerative disease, the prognosis is less favorable and memory deficits would be expected to worsen as the underlying disease progresses(18)"
