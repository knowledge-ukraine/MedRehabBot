            "Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a parkinsonian disorder with many features similar to Parkinson disease (PD). (9) It is considered an atypical parkinsonian syndrome characterized by supranuclear gaze impairment, prominent and early postural instability with falls, axial rigidity greater than appendicular rigidity, and poor or absent response to levodopa.(7) PSP is categorized as a Parkinson-plus syndrome or atypical parkinsonian syndrome.(2) Parkinson-plus syndromes are a group of neurodegenerative disorders that have many of the classical features of PD but have additional features that distinguish them",
            "The name progressive supranuclear palsy refers to progressive degeneration of the brain structures superior to the oculomotor nuclei (\u201csupranuclear\u201d) resulting in palsy and paralysis (5)",
            "Typical age of onset is around 60 years. (5) Onset before the age of 50 is uncommon(7)",
            "PSP is rare; prevalence is approximately 3\u20136 cases per 100,000 individuals (5)",
            "PSP has recently been divided into subtypes. The most common subtypes are classical PSP (Richardson\u2019s syndrome) and PSP-parkinsonism (PSP-P)(3) \u2013Richardson\u2019s syndrome -Typical presentation includes frequent falls, prominent postural instability, vertical gaze palsy, akinesia, and cognitive changes -In the majority of patients with Richardson\u2019s syndrome, logopenia (i.e., difficulty with word finding), apathy, and executive dysfunction are present in early stages \u2013PSP-P -Symptoms include asymmetrical resting tremors and bradykinesia -Gaze palsy and cognitive impairment may not be evident in the early phases -Medications used for PD are beneficial (initially) for individuals with this type of PSP"
