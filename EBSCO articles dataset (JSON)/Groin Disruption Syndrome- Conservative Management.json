            "Sports hernia is a general term for activity-related  pubic pain (pubalgia) that may involve tissue disruption or abnormal tension in the inguinal region (lower abdominal wall or groin)(7)",

            "Many different injuries in the groin area have similar symptoms and can coexist.(30) Groin pain is a nonspecific feature that requires differential diagnosis(2)",
            "Controversy continues over the naming of the various injuries to the groin area. The British Hernia Society\u2019s 2014 position statement proposed eliminating the terms sports hernia (as it is not a true hernia), athletic pubalgia (as the injury does occur in non-athletes),  sportsman\u2019s groin, pubic inguinal pain syndrome, etc. and replacing all of them with the term inguinal disruption(3)",
            "Six to 8 weeks of physical therapy (e.g., core strengthening, stretching), modified rest, and anti-inflammatory  medication is often recommended as the first method of intervention for sports hernia.(2) Optional laparoscopic or open surgical repair may be chosen if conservative treatment fails",
