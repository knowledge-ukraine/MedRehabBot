Did patient receive prompt medical care and what did it include? Have there been any complications up to this point? Has the patient experienced any recovery of functional independence in self-care,  general mobility, or ability to walk? \u2013Course of treatment -Medical management: Did the patient receive in-hospital  rehabilitation, including a program of mobility skills and, if necessary, wheelchair management? Was a functional orthosis prescribed? -Initial management of CCS typically includes(22) -immobilization in the rigid cervical orthosis -maintaining mean arterial pressure of > 85 to 90 mmHg through liberal use of IV fluids, blood products, and vasopressor support as needed -performing serial neurologic examinations -Postoperative management: Was surgical intervention required in the acute stage? For example, was any trauma-related  fracture treated operatively? Are there any precautions or a protocol to follow? Does the patient have a neck brace? -Whether a patient should be treated surgically is debated in the literature. Based on recent studies,the following recommendations/conclusions by the Spinal Cord Society (SCS) and Spine Trauma Study Group (STSG) have been made(24) -Patients with acute traumatic central cord syndrome (ATCCS) due to vertebral fracture, dislocation, traumatic disc herniation, and/or instabilityhave better outcomes with early surgery (\u02c2 24 hours) -For patients with ATCCS due to extension injury in stenotic cervical canal without fracture, fracture dislocation, traumatic disc herniation, and/or instability,there is no clear evidence on the need for surgery and/ortiming of surgery.
