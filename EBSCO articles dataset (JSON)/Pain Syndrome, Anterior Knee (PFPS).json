        ],
        "treatment summary": [
            "Traditional approaches to rehabilitation for PFPS have focused on local factors at the knee associated with patellar maltracking) or faulty foot mechanics. Evidence consistently supports hip strengthening exercises, specifically addressing the abductor and external rotation muscle groups(29)",
            "Therapeutic exercise may decrease pain in patients with PFPS(2,16,17) \u2013Authors of a 2015 Cochrane review of 31 RCTs and quasi-RCTs  (N = 1,690 participants with PFPS) found low-quality but consistent evidence that exercise therapy is associated with clinically important reduced pain, as well as improved functional ability and enhanced long-term  recovery(2) \u2013Authors of a 2017 RCT in Lebanon concluded that starting with a hip exercise program improved functional abilities, as assessed by the Kujala questionnaire. Starting with knee exercises improved muscle performance, assessed with the single-leg  hop test(24) -30 patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome were randomized into two groups -Group A consisted of 15 patients undergoing 4 weeks of hip strengthening exercises, measuring all variables, and then proceeding with 4 additional weeks of knee exercises -Group B consisted of 15 patients undergoing knee exercises for the first 4 weeks, measuring all variables, and then proceeding with the hip strengthening exercises. All variables were again measured at the end of the 8 weeks for both groups \u2013Authors of a systematic review of four level 1b RCTs compared functional outcomes and pain between patients with PFPS in two exercise interventions. All four studies directly compared knee-  focused exercises (strengthening and stretching) combined with hip strengthening with knee-focused  exercises alone. The statistically significant improvements in pain and function in all four studies supported the hip and knee strengthening exercise program(25)",
            "Foot orthoses \u2013Authors of a 2015 systematic review of 11 RCTs found that foot orthoses had significant effects on pain and function and a slight effect on lower limb kinematics and muscle activation(4) \u2013In Denmark, authors of a 2018 RCT found that foot-targeted  exercises combined with foot orthoses and knee exercises resulted in improved outcomes over knee-focused  exercises alone in individuals with PFPS(27) -40 adults (28 women, 12 men)with PFPS were screened for excessive calcaneal eversion and randomized into a group that performed knee-targeted  exercises only or a group that performed knee exercises plus foot-targeted  exercises and orthoses -Exercises were prescribed 3x per week for 12 weeks -Scores on the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) pain subscale at 4-month  follow-up  were significantly better in the foot-targeted exercise and orthoses group. At 12 months there was no significant difference between groups \u2013Authors of a RCT conducted in 2015 in Iran concluded that adding risk-factor assessment to an exercise program may enhance treatment effects on function and pain levels at 12-week  follow-up  in patients with PFPS(23) -A total of 53 participants completed the trial: 26 in the intervention group, 27 in the control group -The intervention group had significant improvements in pain with ADLs (V AS 0- to 100-point  scale) and functional outcomes (Kujala patellofemoral score 0- to 100-point  scale)) ",
            "Patellar bracing \u2013Authors of a 2016 RCT in Germany found that patients with PFPS benefited from a medially directed patellar realignment brace and supervised exercise(26) -156 patients were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of physiotherapy alone or physiotherapy in combination with a brace -Outcomes were measured at baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 1 year -The Kujala score and V AS were improved in the physiotherapy and brace group at 6 and 12 weeks. After 1 year of follow-up  the improvement had diminished",
            "Patellar taping \u2013Authors of a 2015 systematic review and meta-analysis  of 11 studies of participants with PFPS found that Kinesio taping may reduce pain, facilitate muscle activity, and improve motor function. Also, the McConnell taping technique may reduce pain and improve patellar alignment(7) \u2013In contrast, authors of a 2015 systematic review (8 studies, N = 220 participants with anterior knee pain) of the effect of McConnell taping on knee biomechanics found no significant benefit regarding average knee extensor moment, average VMO/vastuslateralis ratio, or average VMO-vastus  lateralis onset timing(18) \u203aFoot strike in runners",
            "Authors of a biomechanics study (N = 16 healthy female runners) in the United States found that emphasizing a forefoot strike pattern decreased patellofemoral joint stress independent of step length(19)",
            "Authors of a 2017 RCT in the United States investigated the effects of retraining the gait from rearfoot strike to forefoot strike in the management of PFPS in recreational runners(28) \u2013Sixteen participants were randomly assigned to the control (n = 8) or experimental (n = 8) group. All participants performed a treadmill test. The experimental group performed 8 training sessions in which they switched from a rearfoot- to forefoot-strike  pattern; the control group received no interventions \u2013There were no significant differences in heart rate, respiratory exchange ratio, and running economy up to 1 month post-retraining.  Knee pain reported on V AS was significantly reduced in the forefoot-strike  group",
