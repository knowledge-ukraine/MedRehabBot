Some patients required a second treatment; however, themicropulse treatment approach resulted in an overall success rate of 89.5% at followup  in terms of both reduced IOP and minimal complications(37) Enucleation (removal of the eye; used in rare cases after the eye becomes blind and is painful or disfigured)(29) Minimally invasive glaucoma surgeries (MIGS) to help control IOP (recent development in treatment)(1) Pharmacologic interventions Eye drops and oral medications(28,29,51) Beta blockers(1,27,51) Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g., acetazolamide/Diamox)(1,27)  Prostaglandin analogues (e.g., latanoprost, bimatoprost, travoprost, tafluprost)(1) Alpha-2  and cholinergic agonists(1) Hyperosmotic agents (IV mannitol)(1) Pilocarpine(1) Fixed combination medications(38) In a study that investigated the effectiveness of fixed combination medications, patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or normaltension glaucoma were randomly assigned to either the brinzolamide/timolol treatment group or the dorzolamide/timolol group (both were combinations of a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor with a beta blocker in eye drop form); patients in both groups were instructed to apply the medication 2x/day; IOP was monitored for up to 3 months following the initial visit; both medication combinations resulted in significant reductions in IOP, but the dorzolamide/timolol group showed a greater reduction in IOP and dorzolamide/timolol was generally better tolerated than the brinzolamide/timolol combination(38) Supplements(39) (recent research of possible effectiveness; currently not widely reported in glaucoma literature) A pilot study found that a food supplement (available in Italy) containing a combination of molecules (forskolin, homotaurine, carnosine, folic acid, vitamins B1, B2, B6, and magnesium) may aid in the prevention of retinal ganglion cell degeneration that occurs in glaucoma(39) Patients with primary open-angle  glaucoma and who were already being treated with topical medications were randomly assigned to either the food supplement group (taken 2x/day for 1 year in addition to current medications) or the control group (topical medications only); followup measures were completed at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months after initial enrollment(39) Results indicated further reductions in IOP for those in the supplement group at the 6-, 9-, and 12-month  follow-ups when compared to the control group; progressive improvements in pattern electroretinogram and foveal sensitivity measures were also seen in the supplement group, suggesting a neuroprotective effect of the supplement(39)",

Forgetting to take medications (particularly in the absence of symptoms) is commonly cited(24) Results of a study conducted in the United States indicate that a sizable number of patients with glaucoma do not take their medications as prescribed(25) Four hundred seven patients with glaucoma completed a 3-month  adherence assessment using electronic monitoring An adherent group who took their medication correctly on at least 75% of days and a nonadherent group were identified Patients who were nonadherent were slightly younger, more likely to be of African American descent, took medications for a shorter time, had lower educational attainment, and had worse scores on mental status and depression scales Identification of these factors may be useful for targeting nonadherent patients for interventions",
