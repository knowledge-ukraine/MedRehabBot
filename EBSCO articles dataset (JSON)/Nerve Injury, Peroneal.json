            "The peroneal nerve is a component of the sciatic nerve. The sciatic nerve is the largest nerve arising from the sacral plexus, which is formed from the L4-S4  ventral rami. As the sciatic nerve traverses the posterior thigh, it bifurcates just proximal to the popliteal fossa into the tibial and common peroneal nerves(1)",
            "The common peroneal nerve extends beyond the lateral head of the gastrocnemius and around the fibular head, where it is most superficial. After this point, the common peroneal nerve bifurcates into the superficial peroneal nerve (traversing the lateral lower leg) and the deep peroneal nerve (within the deep anterior compartment near the interosseous membrane)(1)",
            "The deep peroneal nerve innervates the anterior muscles of the lower leg responsible for ankle dorsiflexion (i.e., tibialis anterior, extensor digitorum longus, extensor hallucis longus, and peroneus tertius), whereas the superficial peroneal muscles innervate the ankle muscles responsible for eversion (i.e., peroneus longus, peroneus brevis)(1)"
