AS is usually (70-75%  of cases) causedby a chromosome 15 deletion or mutation inherited from the mother(7,9,11,12,19)\u2013In other cases, patients with clinically diagnosed AS are found to have uniparental disomy (UPD), in which thechromosome defect is inherited from the father.(10) Paternal uniparental chromosome 15 disomy accounts for only 2-3%of cases(3)\u2013AS can also be due to an imprinting defect on the UBE3A  gene(7)\u2013In 12-15%  of cases, individuals diagnosed with AS do not have a chromosome 15 abnormality and the cause of thedisease is unknown(3,7)",

Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of thegenes associated with AS in the mother of the affected individual can determine risk in future pregnancies.(17) If AS isinherited due to (paternal) UPD affecting chromosome 15, risk might be as low as 1/200, but if it is due to paternal 15;15Robertsonian translocation (a chromosomal rearrangement), risk can be as high as 100%(17)\u2013Genetic counseling should be provided to the families of AS patients to determine risk of reoccurrence in children fromsubsequent pregnancies",
