            "Vascular dementia (VaD) describes impairments in cognitive functioning that result from restricted blood flow to the brain.(1) In 2013, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , fifth edition (DSM-5 ), was published, in which the term \u201cdementia\u201d was replaced with \u201cmajor neurocognitive disorder\u201d (NCD).(46) According to the DSM-5 , NCDs exist on a spectrum defined by the extent of cognitive and functional impairments. The term mild NCD refers to cognitive impairment that does not interfere with independence but results in the need for occasional assistance, increased time to complete activities, or use of compensatory strategies. Major NCD refers to cognitive impairment that is so severe that it results in considerable functional impairments and the individual requires assistance to complete ADLs.(46) DSM-5  authors note that the terms mild NCD and major NCD are inherently arbitrary and that diagnosis will be based on the physician\u2019s careful history taking and observation to determine and appropriately label the extent of impairment.(46) Despite the introduction of the term NCD, DSM-5  authors state that the term dementia is still used within the DSM-5  for continuity and is appropriate in clinical use as well.(46)For detailed information on other types of dementia see the series of Clinical Reviews on dementia",
            "According to the DSM-5 , VaDis classified as \u201cmajor or mild vascular neurocognitive disorder.\u201d In order to have the diagnosis of VaD according to the DSM-5 , an individual must meet the diagnostic criteria for either major or mild NCD and exhibit considerable cognitive deficits including reduced complex attention, poor processing speed, and executive dysfunction that are consistent with a vascular etiology (i.e., occurring in close temporal proximity to one or more cardiovascular events)(46)"

A patient\u2019s inability to attend to, perceive, organize, and remember information will impact receptive and expressive language skills. Difficulties with problem solving and executive functioning negatively affect functional communication. It is important that the SLP assess ways in which cognitive-linguistic difficulties affect the patient\u2019s ability to communicate in social, academic, and/or vocational situations. A cognitive-linguistic assessment should also consider how various communication tasks can be modified in order to support a patient\u2019s functional communication.(17) When selecting tests, SLPs must consider the cultural and linguistic background of the patient and determine if the measurement was standardized on the relevant population.(9) Tests that have normative information on individuals with dementia should be used when possible. Some tests might be too difficult for an individual with severe dementia to complete and therefore cannot adequately identify that individual\u2019s strengths and weaknesses. Assessment tools should provide the SLP with a picture of the patient\u2019s cognitive-communicative  strengths and weaknesses in the areas of language comprehension, language expression, working memory, declarative memory, and nondeclarative/procedural memory symptoms(9)Assess speech production and articulation to identify if the patient presents with apraxia or dysarthria; patients with VaD are likely to have decreased phonemic fluency and a flattening of pitch and intonation in spontaneous speech(15) -For detailed information on symptoms, assessment, and treatment of apraxia, please see Clinical Review\u2026Apraxia of Speech (Acquired) , referenced above -For detailed informationon symptoms, assessment, and treatment of dysarthria, see the series of Clinical Reviews on dysarthriaPatients with VaD are likely to demonstrate diminished grammatical complexity in sentence production.(15) Standardized tests can be used to assess components of language that are affected by cognitive-communication impairments, such as word finding, auditory comprehension, and reading and writing.

            "Authors of a review of the literature described a number of techniques successfully used with patients with dementia.(29) Although some research focuses specifically on patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, much research involves subjects with dementia resulting from a variety and/or combination of diseases (e.g., VaD, dementia with Lewy bodies, Alzheimer\u2019s disease). Research and/or literature reviews focusing exclusively on patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease are not included in this summary \u2013Repeated exposure: spaced retrieval training (SRT) -In SRT, a patient is expected to make a target response (e.g., identify the time for lunch) over gradually increasing increments of time. If the patient recalls the target information incorrectly, the therapist provides the correct response  and then asks the patient to repeat it. If the patient recalls the target information correctly, the increment of time before the patient is asked to repeat the information is increased(29) -Advantages of SRT include: 1) SRT can be embedded in other tasks (e.g., having a conversation), and 2) SRT can be used to target both verbal and nonverbal responses (e.g., recalling a patient\u2019s room location or demonstrating swallow safety precautions)(29) -SRT is supported by extensive research and has been shown to be effective when used in patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease as well as patients experiencing AIDS-related  dementia(29,30) -In a study conducted in the United States involving 66 patients with dementia, researchers examined the effects of SRT on patients\u2019 ability to master communication goals. Patients who received SRT were found to be more likely to master treatment goals than those receiving therapy based upon \u201cbest practice\u201d procedures. During two follow-up evaluations (1 week post intervention and 4months post intervention), patients who received SRT maintained their mastery of communication goals better than patients in the \u201cbest practice\u201d group(30) -Authors of a published systematic review of the literature (13 studies reviewed) found that a majority of patients participating in SRT \u201clearned some or all of the target information and behaviors being taught\u201d(31) -In a published study conducted in Germany comparing word-list  learning skills of healthy young controls, older healthy controls, and patients with VaD, researchers found that although the patients with VaD performed significantly worse in delayed recall tasks (recalling the words on the initial word list) as compared to the controls, these patients were able to recall words with a negative emotional connotation (e.g., \u201cmisery\u201d) significantly better than emotionally neutral words (e.g. \u201cjoint\u201d)(32) \u2013Repeated exposure: quizzes -Published research has shown increases in category naming and recall of personal biographical information when patients participated in intervention combining repeated exposure and quizzes(29) -The repeated exposure requires the patient to use effort to generate a response, while the quiz is structured to constrain the set of possible answers (i.e., multiple choice questions), thus prompting a more directed search of episodic memory and reducing the potential for incorrect (error) responses(29) \u2013Errorless learning (EL) -Intervention using EL attempts to prevent patients from making mistakes while they are learning a new skill or acquiring new information(29) -Patients are asked not to guess when they do not know the correct response; however, cues and forced-choice recognition limit the number of possible patient responses(29) -Authors of a review of the literature found that errorless learning has been beneficial in teaching patients with dementia the names of persons, personal biographical information, how to use a calendar, how to use an electronic memory aid, and new face-name  associations(29)",

Although research supporting the use of these principles has primarily involved patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, the principles might benefit patients experiencing memory impairments resulting from other types of dementia. These principles include:(29) \u2013Repetition is beneficial/use of priming: Patients with dementia profit from repetition. Repetition can help these patients relearn forgotten information or learn new information. Authors of a literature reviewfound research that providing patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease with repeated opportunities to recall information is more beneficial than repeatedly presenting them with information.(29) Priming is the practice of repeatedly activating related concepts, thus strengthening memory traces. Information that is primed is more accessible and more quickly retrieved \u2013Patients should be actively involved in learning: When a patient generates a response, he or she is required to use greater effort than when required to only watch or listen. Since generating a response is more effortful, it requires patients to process information more deeply and creates a more long-lasting  memory trace \u2013Error responses should be avoided: Patient errors should be avoided because every time the patient repeats an error, the error response is strengthened. EL techniques attempt to reduce patient errors by providing the patient with cues during retrieval in order to limit the number of possible responses and limit guessing when the patient does not know the correct response \u2013Focus on single rather than multiple tasks: Patients who present with divided attention deficits should not be asked to perform multiple tasks or processes concurrently \u2013Use cues to facilitate recall: Cues, such as providing the first letter of a name the patient is trying to recall, can refine the patient\u2019s search of his or her episodic memory. Such cues can be used to facilitate information recall or to decrease undesirable behaviors",
