Several incorrect forms are produced for a single word; for example, a child might produce \u201chorse\u201d as \u201chot\u201d, \u201csos\u201d, and \u201cho\u201d. This is in contrast to a consistent phonological disorder, in which a child consistently uses the same non-developmental  (atypical) error pattern and a phonological delay, in which error patterns are consistent and typical in the speech of younger children.(1)For detailed information on other types of phonological speech sound disorders, please see Clinical Review\u2026Speech Sound Disorders: Phonological ; CINAHL Topic ID # T903885.

According to Dodd et. al. (2005), when a child is asked to name 25 pictures on three separate occasions during a single evaluation session and shows 40% or greater variability on errors, an inconsistent phonological disorder exists.(1) For example, a child with an inconsistent phonological disorder might produce the word block as [kak], [bag], and [ak] while a child with a consistent phonological disorder would make the same error on all three productions The Diagnostic Evaluation of Articulation and Phonology \u2013 US Edition (DEAP)  (13) \u2013A norm-referenced  test that includes two screening measures and three assessments(14) \u2013The Diagnostic Screen determines the need for additional testing of a child\u2019s speech production and the Oral Motor Screen indicates if an in-depth  oral-motor  assessment is necessary.(14) The three assessment measures include the Articulation Assessment, the Phonology Assessment, and the Word Inconsistency Assessment. These assessments lead to a differential diagnosis of articulation disorder, delayed phonological development, consistent phonological disorder, or inconsistent phonological disorder(14) \u2013The U.S. edition of the DEAP was standardized in 2005 and involved over 650 American children between the ages of 3 years, 0 months and 8 years, 11 months(14)one normed on children in the UK and one normed on children in Australia(15,16) ",

For detailed information on the assessment of childhood language disorders, please see the series of Clinical Reviews on this topicChildren with inconsistent phonological disorder have been shown to have difficulty with syllable segmentation tasks although they perform similar to typically developing children on measures of rhyme and alliteration. Children with consistent phonological disorder have been shown to have difficulty with rhyme and alliteration when compared to typically developing children.(11)Briefly assess the child\u2019s phonological awareness skillsChildren with speech sound disorders are at risk for reading difficulties. Children with inconsistent phonological disorder exhibit significantly higher rates of spelling errors (e.g., letter substitutions, omissions and final letter errors) when compared to children with typically developing speech.(11) A brief screening of reading and spelling is appropriate for school-aged  children with more in-depth  testing as appropriateAssess articulation and phonologyUse a standardized test or an informal (nonstandardized) analysis to determine errors that have a high frequency of occurrence, are early developing, and/or are functionally important for that child and his or her family. For specific sounds, the number of omissions, substitutions, distortions, and additions can be completed(6,9)Calculate information on word length (by syllable) from a speech sample. Make a list of the syllable types used by the child (e.g., V , CV , CVC)(9)Use a standardized test to classify and quantify phonological processes (patterns relating to sound errors). The Diagnostic Evaluation of Articulation and Phonology  (DEAP ), one standardized test that can be used for this purpose, is described in the section Special Tests Specific to Diagnosis.

            "Core vocabulary therapy is the primary method used to treat an inconsistent phonological disorder(21) \u2013The goal of core vocabulary therapy is to teach a child to \u201cbuild\u201d words using phonological plans(21) \u2013Core vocabulary therapy does not aim to correct the phonological patterns present in the child\u2019s speech but rather to target the weakness underlying the child\u2019s output system (i.e., the phonological planning deficit)(21) \u2013In core vocabulary therapy, a child learns to produce a set of functional, high-frequency  words more accurately and with consistency (yet not necessarily error-free)(21) \u2013Detailed, specific information about each word in the target set is provided to the child and then consistent production is established through drill work (target = 100 productions in a 30-minute  session)(17,21) \u2013At the beginning of therapy, a set of at least 50 words are chosen to target. These words are selected by the parents, teacher, caregiver, and child(17,21) \u2013Common target words include family and friends\u2019 names, function words, foods, and names of the child\u2019s favorite things(21) \u2013Feedback is given when there is an error in target word production. The feedback includes a detailed description of the error and how it can be corrected. Imitation of correct production is not recommended because it prevents the child from formulating his or her own phonological plan(17,21) \u2013Once a child is able to produce his or her target words in a consistent manner, he or she may benefit from phonological contrast therapy to target any consistently produced developmental phonological process errors(17,21) \u2013Ideal service delivery model for core vocabulary therapy involves:(17,21) -Two 30-minute  sessions per week(17,21) -First session of the week includes selecting a subset of words (5 or more) on which to focus and establishing consistent production of these words(17,21) -Second session of the week focuses on producing the subset of target words, in a consistent manner, a high number of times(17,21) -At the end of a week\u2019s second session, the child is asked to produce the week\u2019s subset of target words three times. Words that are produced the same (i.e., consistently) each time are removed from the practice list(21) -Therapy is conducted one-on-one  due to the individualized nature of the target words(21)  -Parents attend therapy and do daily practice at home(21) -Therapy usually occurs over a 6 to 8-week  time period. A second 6 to 8-week-long  session is occasionally required to establish consistency(21)",
            "The following studies support the effectiveness of using core vocabulary therapy to treat an inconsistent phonological disorder: \u2013Researchers in Australia conducted case studies of 3 boys with inconsistent phonological disorder. Core vocabulary treatment was implemented, although length of treatment varied: one boy received 12 speech therapy sessions, one boy received 27 speech therapy sessions, and one boy received 38 speech therapy sessions. Results show that following core vocabulary intervention, all three boys displayed significant decreases in inconsistent speech production and increases in Percent Consonants Correct (PCC)(17) \u2013Researchers in Australia conducted a study involving 18 children between the ages of 4;8 and 6;5. Ten children had an inconsistent phonological disorder and 8 children had a consistent phonological disorder. Participants each received two, 8-week  blocks of therapy. One block of therapy involved phonological contrast therapy, which targets production error patterns (i.e., specific phonological processes). One block of therapy involved core vocabulary therapy. According to the authors of this study, results show that children with inconsistent phonological disorder benefited most from core vocabulary therapy while children with consistent phonological disorder benefited most from phonological contrast therapy(19) \u2013In a study conducted in Australia, researchers examined the effects of three therapy methods: phonological contrast therapy, core vocabulary therapy, and Prompts for Restructuring Oral Muscular Phonetic Targets(PROMPT).(20) PROMPT is an intervention method that targets the physical-sensory  components of motor speech performance.(22) Each type of therapy was administered to the three children involved in the study: one diagnosed with a consistent phonological disorder and one diagnosed with an inconsistent phonological disorder. The authors of this study reported that the children with inconsistent phonological disorder benefited the most from core vocabulary therapy while the child with consistent phonological disorder benefited the most from phonological contrast therapy. One of the children with inconsistent phonological disorder showed additional benefit from phonological contrast therapy once consistency of speech production was established(20) .
