After an on-road  test, the OT and driving school instructor should discuss the outcome and provide any necessary recommendations(1) \u2013Throughout the evaluation, the OT should pay close attention to the underlying performance skills required for driving in order to determine appropriate interventions to support skill remediation as needed(9) \u2013Individualized on-road  training lessons and restricted licensing can support eventual return to driving for patients who fail an initial driving assessment(13) -Based on a study in which researchers assessed the goals, processes, and efficacy of on-road  training lessons for persons with mild to severe TBI -Study included 340 participants; all participants completed a standard occupational therapy driver assessment which included an off-road  and on-road assessment -Participants who failed the initial assessment (94 total) were provided with further on-road  training with goals focusing on the errors/difficulties encountered during the initial assessment; goals included compensatory strategies for cognitive difficulties (e.g., attention, memory, processing speed, planning, navigation), adaptive equipment training and/or compensatory strategies for physical impairments, visual strategies to improve field loss or other visual difficulties, strengthening of prior skills (e.g., road law knowledge, adapting to driving environment, and increasing general driving experience), and management of psychological issues (e.g., anxiety, poor confidence) -An average of seven on-road  lessons were provided; reassessments were then completed to determine readiness to drive -After receiving on-road  training, 42 participants successfully returned to driving with an unrestricted license and 45 returned to driving with a restricted license; licensing restrictions included a restricted driving area, automatic transmission only, and/or necessary adaptive equipment \u2013Self-awareness  of driving performance may be an important component of the driver rehabilitation process(14) -Based on a study in which researchers investigated the impact of self-awareness  of driving on successful completion of a return to driving assessment among persons with TBI; the relationship between self-awareness  of driving ability and cognitive functions required for driving was also investigated -Study included 37 participants with moderate to severe TBI who were referred for a return to driving assessment and49 healthy controls -All participants completed on on-road  evaluation and were administered assessments measuring fine motor control, psychomotor speed, attentional switching, visuospatial perception, executive functioning, and mood; a driving self-awareness  measure was also completed by each participant as well as on-road evaluations completed by clinicians -24 participants with TBI passed the on-road assessment and 13 failed; results of the self-awareness  measure indicated that those who failed had significantly reduced awareness of driving ability. They tended to overestimate their performance and rate their skills higher than the clinicians; reduced awareness was associated with increased frequency of driving errors during the on-road  assessment as well as impairments with psychomotor speed, attentional switching, and visual perception  \u2013Patients who are no longer able to drive and live alone in the community should be given interventions to address age-related  physical/mental changes as well as environmental changes(1) -Interventions should include mobility counseling(5) which focuses on problem solving, access to community resource and alternative transportation, and education on planning and scheduling transportation in advance -Planning should focus on maintaining and expanding a patient\u2019s social network, prioritizing physical activities as needed, and learning how to ask for assistance from others \u2013The OT should provide older adults with training on use of technological resources such as videophones, social networking, and Skype to allow older adults to keep in contact with friends and families(1) \u2013Patients with related diagnoses (e.g., post stroke) may demonstrate marked differences in ability to drive -Patients post right hemispheric lesions are 1.7 times more likely to cross the central line while driving and 4.8 times more likely to have an accident compared to patients with left hemispheric lesions(7) \u2013For patients with cognitive decline or related diagnosis, family and caregiver interviews are imperative for obtaining a more global assessment of driving history and ability(8) \u2013Driver rehabilitation practices can support driving readiness and/or community mobility skills for teenagers and young adults with high-functioning  autism spectrum disorder (ASD)(16) -Based a study in which researchers implemented a \u201cboot camp\u201d program to facilitate improved driving knowledge and skills, examine alternative community mobility options, and implement skill-building activities to improve general safety -Study included eight participants between 15 and 19 years of age -Bootcamp program lasted 7 weeks: week one included five (7-hour)  days of training; weeks 2\u20137 included two (90-minute)  training sessions per week -Skill-building  activities focused on hazard identification, traffic controls and road rules, vehicle safety education, use of bus systems and planning a trip, and role-playing  scenarios -In a follow-up  survey after completing the program, two participants obtained their driver\u2019s license, two reported increased confidence about either community mobility in general or about proceeding to enroll in a formal driver\u2019s education program, and one reported success with consistently using the bus system at his university"

An on-road  assessment which takes the patient through various road conditions, traffic patterns, and settings is also completed to determine if the patient has the mental and physical skills required for safe driving(9) \u2013OTs working in driver rehabilitation assist in determining medical fitness to drive and utilize a variety of intervention approaches to support driving readiness(15) -In a survey of OTs from three stroke rehabilitation hospitals in Canada, respondents indicated that office-based  measures are typically used to screen physical-motor  and cognitive-perceptual  abilities of patients post stroke; measures may include standardized, subjective, and/or technology-based (driving simulation) screening tools to assess driving readiness -Interventions used to improve driving readiness skills include technology-based  activities (e.g., driving simulator, iPad activities, computer games/activities), table-top  activities (e.g., visual scanning and other worksheets, driving scenario questionnaires), and physical activities (e.g., walking, throwing, and catching, path-finding/navigating  activities, activities involving car controls) \u2013Driving simulators can be used in driver rehabilitation, either as part of the initial assessment process or for skill training(9,15) -Driving simulators provide virtual scenarios that reflect different traffic conditions and allow clinicians to observe how a patient reacts in various driving situations(9) -Researchers who studied combat veterans with multiple injuries/associated conditions who drove prior to combat and who had the potential to return to driving found that a simulator-based  occupational therapy driving intervention was more effective than standard traffic safety education in reducing driving-related  errors(12) -Study included 26 participants who were randomly assigned to either the intervention (simulator-based  training) group or the control (traffic-safety  education) group  -Intervention group participated in three 1-hour sessions of simulator training focusing on identification of driving errors, personalized strategies to reduce errors, and practice with strategy implementation; the intervention was provided by an occupational therapy driver rehabilitation specialist (OT-DRS) -The control group received3 hours of traffic-safety  education focusing on traffic knowledge, vehicle safety, accident prevention, defensive driving control, psychological factors that can impact driving, and driving under the influence of various substances; the education was based on a traffic safety curriculum and was provided by a traffic safety official and through video -Participants in both groups completed pre- and post-test  assessments focusing on visual, sensory, cognitive, and motor functioning as well as a simulator-based  assessment of driving errors (e.g., speed regulation, lane maintenance, visual scanning, gap acceptance/timing of turns, adjustment to stimuli, vehicle spacing/positioning, and signaling) -Results indicated that participants in the intervention group made fewer errors relating to speed regulation, signaling, gap acceptance, and total number of driving errors at post-test compared to the control group \u2013OTs working in driver rehabilitation also make recommendations regarding equipment options that would best support a patient\u2019s driving ability(9) \u2013Examples of vehicle adaptations(10) -Steering: steering knob, palm grip, tri-pin,  joystick controls, reduced/low effort steering devices. Devices are useful for patients with CV A, multiple sclerosis, SCI, or arthritic conditions -Accelerator and brake controls: pedal extensions, left foot accelerator, gas pedal block, hand controls. Useful for patients with a CV A (right hemiplegia) or right-leg  amputees. Hand controls can be used which are attached to the accelerator and brake, allowing drivers to control the vehicle with their hands -Mirrors: to assist checking blind spots or broaden peripheral vision -Seating and positioning: cushions, swivel base seats for transfer, wheelchair securement systems -Handybar: removable grab bar for transferring in/out of the vehicle -Leg lift strap: allows patients with lower extremity weakness or pain to strap their lower extremity over the vehicle threshold to safely sit in the driver seat -Global positioning system (GPS): allows easy navigation by inputting the destination\u2019s address into the system -Backup camera: allows patient to view the rear of the vehicle on a video screen in the front dashboard \u2013Vision is an important aspect of driving. Retraining of ocular functioning should focus on visual exercises, improving awareness, and visual scanning \u2013Patients with motor impairments should be encouraged to participate in a home exercise program.
