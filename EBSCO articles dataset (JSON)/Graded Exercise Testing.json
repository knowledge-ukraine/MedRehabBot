            "Graded exercise testing (GET) is a common method of determining the effect of disease or disability on aerobic work capacity (AWC).GET is clinically useful for assessing exercise-related  health risk, for verifying the benefit of a medical or surgical intervention to improve AWC, and for prescribing exercise training intensity in a preventive or rehabilitative program. GET is used as an outcome measure of training in a wide range of patient populations and has been used to predict the length of recovery in pediatric patients post-concussion(5)",
            "GET protocols have progressive stages that gradually increase exercise intensity on a treadmill (incline and speed) or cycle ergometer (resistance). Stages advance to a predetermined end point such as a target heart rate (HR), rating of perceived exertion (RPE), or to the patient\u2019s AWC associated with volitional fatigue(1)",
            "Onset of fatigue or other limiting signs and symptoms at an early stage of GET indicates low cardiorespiratory fitness, or peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak), that often corresponds to deficits in endurance for ADLs",
            "Medical guidelines are the basis for safe and effective GET procedures(1)",
            "HR, blood pressure (BP), and RPE should always be monitored during GET. Optional respiratory gas collection to calculate VO2peak enhances individualized exercise prescription and provides the gold-standard  measurement of cardiorespiratory fitness. However, VO2peak is more often estimated from the oxygen (O2) requirement of the highest stage or work rate reached on a standard GET protocol(1)",
            "Diagnostic GET may include additional noninvasive monitoring (e.g., ECG, oximeter, pulmonary function tests). Such \u201cexercise stress testing\u201d of patients with known or symptomatic cardiac or pulmonary diseases should be conducted in specialty clinics with physician supervision and emergency rescue equipment.(1) This Clinical Review focuses on GET of patients without suspected heart or lung disease and consequently with average exercise-related  cardiopulmonary risk for age"
