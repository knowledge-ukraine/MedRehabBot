            "The atherothromboticischemic type of acute myocardial infarction (MI) is often a life-threatening  event. Prolonged obstruction of coronary blood flow (i.e., myocardial ischemia) commonly results in failure of adequate heart muscle contraction. Complete cellular death in the affected myocardium of a type 1 MI may take 2 to 4 hours, depending mostly on the amount of collateral blood flow around the coronary obstruction. In the clinical settingcardiac biomarker changes with at least one value above the 99th percentile occur, accompanied by several typical findings(1) \u2013Symptoms of angina due to prolonged insufficient coronary artery blood flow \u2013New or presumed-new  abnormal findings on the electrocardiogram (ECG), such as ST-segment  and T-wave changes or new left bundle branch block (LBBB) ST-segment elevation on the ECG is characteristic of acute transmural infarction. ST elevation MI (STEMI) is often followed by the development of pathological Q waves after scarring of the necrotic area \u2013Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new left ventricle (LV) regional wall motion abnormality \u2013Identification of an intracoronary artery thrombus by angiography or autopsy \u2013Symptoms of acute MI followed by cardiac death, but the person died before obtaining the cardiac biomarkers or before the increase in biomarker values \u2013Stent thrombosis (in persons with prior stent placement) associated with MI when detected by coronary angiography or autopsy in the setting of myocardial ischemia and with a rise and/or fall of cardiac biomarker values \u2013Coronary artery bypass grafting-related  MI is usually defined by elevation of biomarkers in patients with normal baseline cardiac troponin (cTn) values, in addition to -new pathological Q waves or new LBBB, angiographic documentation of new graft or new native coronary artery occlusion, or imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality",
            "Ischemic ST-segment  depression with T-wave  changes characterizes the non-STEMI (NSTEMI) or type 2 MI. Lacking characteristic ST-segment elevation, such patients are typically not triaged for immediate transfer to the catheterization laboratory and, therefore, often receive less primary percutaneous coronary angioplasty. When referred to cardiac rehabilitation, patients with NSTEMI have similar existential anxiety about their heart health as STEMI patients(2,19) ",
            "Prior MI or non-acute  MI is evidenced by(1) \u2013Pathological Q waves, usually without symptoms, in the absence of acute ischemic events \u2013Imaging evidence of a region of loss of viable myocardium that is thinned and fails to contract (i.e., abnormal ventricular wall motion). Pathological findings of a prior MI include fibrosis and dense collagenous scar formation in the myocardium",
            "Approximately 7.5 million persons living in the United States are MI survivors.(2) Estimates of the annual incidence of MI in the United States range from 600,000 new and 320,000 recurrent attacksto1.5 million cases(15)",
