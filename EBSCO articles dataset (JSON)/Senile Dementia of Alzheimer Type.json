            "Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative brain disease characterized by a progressive decline in executive function (i.e., cognition, memory) and physical functioning in daily life(1)",
            "In 2011, the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer\u2019s Association (NIA-AA) revised clinical diagnostic criteria for AD. The updated guidelines describe three stages of AD(36) \u2013Preclinical: No significant clinical symptoms are present. Brain changes, including amyloid buildup and other nerve cell changes, may already be in progress \u2013Mild cognitive impairment (MCI): Symptoms are present of memory and/or other thinking problems that do not yet interfere with the person\u2019s independence but are more than normal for the person\u2019s age and education. Persons with MCI may or may not progress to Alzheimer\u2019s dementia. Brain changes are present \u2013Alzheimer\u2019s dementia: The final stage of the disease. Symptoms such as memory loss, word-finding  difficulties, and visual/spatial problems are significant enough to impair a person\u2019s ability to function independently. Brain changes are present",
            "Alzheimer's disease is thought to begin 20 years or more before symptoms arise(35)",
            "The estimated number of persons in the world with AD is 46 million and by 2050 is projected to reach 131.5 million. In the United States the estimated number of Americans aged 65 and older with AD is 5.8 million. By 2050, this may grow to 13.8 million(35)",
            "There currently is no cure for AD. Focus should be on the prevention of AD before it fully manifests. Exercise is one of these preventive measures",
            "Increasing physical activity may reduce pathogenic changes in the early stage of AD, have a positive effect on cognitive function, and help to maintain ability to perform ADLs(34,37,38) \u2013Please see Clinical Review Alzheimer\u2019s Disease and Exercise , CINAHL Topic ID Number: T902776 for more information",
            "Cognitive impairment in older adults is associated with impaired gait mechanics (i.e., reduced stepping accuracy and reduced stride length, speed, and cadence) that increase the risk of falls.(19)As in other neurocognitive disorders, a feature of AD is aimless or purposeless ambulation (i.e., \u201cwandering\u201d), which also increases the risk of falls and other injuries.(20)Functional training may thus help to prevent falls in persons with AD(2,3,4)"

The first treatment to target the fundamental pathophysiology of AD was granted accelerated U.S. FDA approval in adults in June 2021. Patients receiving aducanumab in trials had a significant reduction of amyloid beta plaque compared to controls, who had no reduction of amyloid beta plaque. This approval in the U.S was controversial. Although early results showed aducanumab lowered amyloid beta plaque there was not clear evidence that there was a clinical benefit to patients.In December 2021 the European Medicines Agency did not approve aducanumab for use in the European Unionbecause of the lack of scientific evidence. More research is needed to prove its effectiveness(39,51) Medications approved by the U.S. FDA include rivastigmine, galantamine, donepezil, memantine, and memantine combined with donepezil. All except memantine work to increase the level of neurotransmitters in the brain and thereby improve cognition, but effectiveness varies. Memantine blocks certain receptors in the brain from excess stimulation that can damage nerve cells(56) Antipsychotic drugs can be used to treat the symptoms of hallucinations, aggression, and agitation. However, these must be used with caution because they are associated with an increased risk of stroke and death in persons with AD. They are not widely recommended(35)",

            "Exercise has no intrinsic negative side effects and there is evidence that it can protect cognitive function in the aging population. Research results seem to be consistent that exercise improves general health in patients with AD. Some studies have demonstrated that exercise can improve cognitive function and/or delay its decline; however, other studies have been less conclusive(34,37,49,50) \u2013Authors of an integrative review of 17 studies reviewed the effect of exercise interventions on health-related  outcomes in community-dwelling  adults with AD. The integrative results confirmed that exercise can enhance general health, but the effects of exercise on cognitive function could not be determined(50) \u2013Authors of a meta-analysis  of 13 RCTs examined the effects of physical activity and exercise on cognitive function of patients with AD. Intervention groups showed a statistically significantly improvement in cognition as measured by the MMSE compared to the control groups. This meta-analysis  suggests that physical activity and exercise can improve cognition of older adults with AD(37) \u2013Authors of an RCT examined the effect of a group-based  exercise program on mental outcomes in patients with mild to moderate AD(49) -The group-based  exercise patients participated in 45-minute  sessions 3 times per week for 8 weeks. The sessions consisted of balance, resistance, aerobic, and flexibility exercises -Those in the group-based  exercise intervention showed a significant increase in their MMSE scores compared to the control group. The group-based exercise patients had no change in their Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Cooperative Study\u2013Activities  of Daily Living Scale (ADCS-ADL)  scores, while the control group had a 13.77% decrease in their ADCS-ADL  from the start of the study -The authors concluded that group exercise is a low-cost  intervention that can positively influence cognitive function and stabilize patients\u2019 ability to perform ADLs \u2013Authors of a 2018 meta-analysis  of 19 studies found that exercise training may delay the decline in cognitive functioning in persons at risk of AD or in whom it has been diagnosed, and that aerobic exercise seemed to have the greatesteffect(34) -Analyzed studies were controlled studies that included an exercise-only intervention and a non-diet,  non-exercise  control group and reported pre-and post-intervention  cognitive function measurements -35% of participants had a diagnosis of AD. The rest were at risk of AD, most because they had MCI (64%), but some (1%) due to having a parent with AD -Exercise training was performed on average for 3.4 days per week at moderate intensity, for an average of 45.2 minutes per session for an average of 18.6 weeks -65% of interventions consisted of aerobic training, 35% consisted of aerobic and resistance training  -Control groups experienced a significant decrease in MMSE scores during the intervention. Average MMSE scores of the exercise groups increased during the intervention -Improvement in cognitive function after aerobic exercise training was 3 times as great as the improvement after combined aerobic and resistance exercise training interventions",
            "Physical therapy interventions including various types of exercise can also improve overall function (e.g., ability to perform ADLs, mobility, strength, and balance) \u2013Evidence-based  public health messaging plays an important role in the health impact of many diseases. The Ontario Brain Institute formulated an evidence-based  message using the evidence from 7 systematic reviews focused on AD prevention and 20 reviews on symptom management:(38) -\u201cRegular participation in physical activity is associated with a reduced risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Among older adults with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other dementias, regular physical activity can improve performance of activities of daily living and mobility, and may improve general cognition and balance\u201d \u2013Regular exercise may slow the rate of functional deterioration in mild AD and reduce falls in patients with advanced AD(33) -Based on a secondary analysis of an RCT conducted in Finland that examined the effects of exercise intervention twice a week for 12 months in patients with AD (N = 194). The effects in participants with mild dementia and in participants with advanced dementia were studied separately -In subjects with mild dementia, decline in physical functioning, as measured by the FIM at 12 months, was slower in the intervention group than in the controls -In subjects with advanced AD the incident rate of falls was lower in the intervention group than in the controls at 12 months, indicating that the exercise intervention was effective in preventing falls in this group \u2013Participation in a community-based  exercise program can improve cognitive function, mobility, and independence in persons with AD(17) -Based on an RCT involving 40 Australian community-dwelling  persons with AD (mean age, 74 years) allocated to either a 4-month  exercise program group or usual-treatment  control group -MMSE scores averaged 22.0 (range, 10\u201328),  indicating mild to moderate dementia -The exercise program consisted of daily exercises and walking under the supervision of the personal caregiver -Mobility was assessed with the TUG test and functional independence with the Instrumental ADL (IADL) Scale -At 4-month  follow-up,  the exercise group had significantly increased scores on the MMSE, TUG test, and IADL Scale compared to controls \u2013Physical-therapist-guided  and tailored exercise, either at home or in a daycare center, may slow deterioration of physical function in the long term compared to usual care(18) -Based on an RCT conducted in Finland involving home-dwelling  patients with mild to moderate AD (N = 210; mean age, 71 years) who lived with their spousal caregiver -The three trial arms were -Group-based  exercise (GE; N = 70) 1 hour twice per week for 1 year -Home-based  exercise (HE; N = 70)1 hour twice per week for 1 year -Control group (CG; N = 70) that received usual community care -All groups deteriorated in function (FIM) after 1 year, but FIM scores decreased significantly more in CG than in either GE group or HE group -HE and GE groups had significantly fewer falls than CG in the follow-up year \u2013Resistance training may improve performance in some ADLs(23) -Based on an exploratory study in Brazil of patients with mild to moderate AD (N = 34; mean age, 78 years) who had caregiver support -The training group (TG) underwent a progressive resistance exercise program (20 repetitions of five exercises for 1 hour, 3 times per week, 16 weeks) -The social gathering group (SGG) participated in group dynamics (e.g., writing and reading activities) for a similar duration and frequency as TG -Performance in ADLs was assessed by 800-m  walk time, moving around the house, climbing stairs, standing up from floor, manual skills, and putting on socks -Results: Lower limb strength, balance, flexibility, and ADLs increased significantly more in TG than SGG at 16 weeks \u2013Ambulatory physical therapy may improve motor abilities of older adults with AD(27)  -Based on a study conducted in France that involved 50 patients who did not receive ambulatory physical therapy and 20 patients who did -Outcome measures included MMSE, Tinetti Mobility Assessment, mini motor test scores, TUG test, gait speed, one-leg stance time, history of falls within the last 6 months, ability to rise from the floor, and use of walking aid -No differences between the groups were noted at baseline. Analysis of variance showed progression of cognitive disorders in both groups -There was significant improvement or stability of motor abilities in the group that received ambulatory physical therapy. These abilities decreased in the group not receiving ambulatory physical therapy \u2013A rehabilitation program that integrates recommendations of the American College of Sports Medicine for aerobic, resistance, and balance exercises may be beneficial for patients in various phases of AD(28) -Based on a study conducted in Spain that enrolled 64 patients with AD into an intervention program lasting 12 months -Outcome measures included cognitive ability (MMSE), fitness (Chair Stand Test), level of independence (Barthel Index), and quality of life (SF-12) -The intervention program had positive effects on fitness and quality of life in patients in the mild to moderate phases of AD. No effect on cognitive ability was noted \u2013Mild to moderate intensity multimodal physical exercise may improve sleep disturbances and the performance of IADLs in patients with AD(25) -Based on a study conducted in Spain involving 35 patients with AD (19 in a trained group and 16 in a control group) -Multimodal exercise was performed in 1-hour  sessions 3 times per week for 6 months -Significant improvements in IADLs and in sleep disturbance were observed in the trained group. Maintenance or worsening occurred in the control group",
            "Helping patients with AD engage in enjoyable and meaningful activities can be a challenge. Authors of a descriptive review examined 83 different apps available that are targeted to patients with AD and other related dementias(48) \u2013The activities in the apps included watching and viewing programs, music and sounds, memory training, learning and information, social interaction, and eye-hand  coordination activities \u2013It is recommended therapists and healthcare professionals use a person-centered approach in providing guidance in selecting appropriate apps for patients .
