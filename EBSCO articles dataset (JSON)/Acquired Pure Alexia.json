            "Approaches for increasing accuracy of single-word  reading ability \u2013Training for letter recognition and encoding of letter strings:  Authors of a case study examined the effects of a treatment designed to improve a subject\u2019s ability to recognize isolated letters and to process letter combinations. One half of the letters of the alphabet were trained and the other half were used as control stimuli. Training tasks and assessments were delivered via a computer in 12 training sessions. All responses were given orally by the patient. Examples of training tasks include timed letter matching (uppercase to lowercase) and timed reading of letter strings (CVC, CVCC, VCC). Results indicated improved rate of letter identification for trained and untrained sets and an increase in the subject\u2019s word-reading  speed. However, there was no fundamental change in the patient\u2019s method to encode isolated letters or words; the patient continued to use a letter-by-letter  strategy(5) \u2013Whole-word  training -In a study conducted in the United Kingdom with 9 patients with pure alexia, researchers found that a computerized, whole-word  training program significantly improved reading ability(41) -Outcome measures included reading speed as well as images of the brain taken through magnetoencephalography (MEG) to assess functional changes resulting from therapy(41) -The reading therapy program was computer-based and self-administered;  patients were given laptops to take home with the training software loaded onto them(41) -Patients were instructed to use the program for at least 20 minutes per day for 6 weeks(41) -In the training program, single words were presented on the screen for 500 ms while a recording of the word was played simultaneously. The rationale for playing the word for such a short time was to prevent the patients from using a letter-by-letter  reading strategy and \u201cforcing\u201d the brain to read the whole word(41) -After 15 training trials, the software moved to a testing interval in which the patient was presented with a word from the training block with a paired spoken word; sometimes the word and the spoken word matched and sometimes they did not. The patient was instructed to press one button to indicate \u201csame\u201d and another for \u201cdifferent.\u201d In initial, easy testing intervals, words were easier to distinguish (i.e., \u201cfood\u201d/\u201dhate\u201d), but as the training progressed, they became more difficult (i.e., \u201cfood\u201d/\u201dfoot\u201d)(41)  -As a means of motivating the patients to spend time using the therapy program, researchers offered a monetary reward of one pence per correct answer and the computer kept a score counter at the bottom of the screen as the therapy went on(41) -Immediately after the 6-week  training period, researchers measured training effects on reading speed. Compared to pretraining measurements, post-training  reading speed for the trained words was significantly faster. All trained words were read significantly faster than untrained words post-training.  Researchers also found that the greatest training effects were observed on longer words (5 or 6 letters). Reading speed was then assessed 2 to 4 weeks post-training  and results indicated that the significant training effect on word reading speed was not maintained(41) -Similar effects were observed on the MEG scans where significantly stronger activation was observed for trained words versus untrained words(41) -Authors of a case study involving a German-speaking patient with pure dyslexia examined the effect of whole-word training on word reading and letter identification; regular language therapy was administered during the same time period(36) -Training took place over 4 weeks and included 40 sessions total (twice daily every weekday) -Each training phase (each phase was 16 sessions) started with an auditory-visual verification task to familiarize the patient with the training items without requiring him to read or name the items; in this task, the patient was asked to identify whether a written word matched a preceding spoken word -The rest of the sessions in each training phase consisted of whole-word  recognition tasks in which target words were presented repeatedly within each session (each word appeared 4 times per session) with limited exposure duration; feedback was provided by the therapist if the target word could not be named correctly within the time limit -Following the training, the patient\u2019s word-reading  ability improved in terms of both speed and accuracy; additionally, even though it was not addressed directly in the therapy program, the patient\u2019s ability to identify single letters was also significantly improved \u2013Tactile-kinesthetic  technique:  Authors of a case study investigated the effects of training a patient with pure dyslexia to copy each letter of a word onto his left palm using a capped pen, naming the letter, and then saying the word. This method increased reading accuracy but decreased the subject\u2019s speed in reading. In a second experiment, the same subject was presented with isolated letters and letter strings and told to name them as quickly and as accurately as possible. The subject was prompted to use the tactile-kinesthetic  technique if accuracy dropped below 90% and was also given cards of letters and letter strings to practice at home. This stage of the experiment lasted for 9 months. Improvement in speed and accuracy of single-word  reading was noted for both trained and untrained words as well as sentences. Improvement on more lengthy material was not demonstrated(37)",
            "Instruction for increasing reading fluency and comprehension \u2013Multiple Oral Reading (MOR):  MOR involves repeated guided reading practice of the same material over a period of days or weeks. The goal when using MOR for patients with pure dyslexia is to improve reading rate by facilitating whole-word  recognition(2) -Authors of a case study of a patient with pure dyslexia examined the effects of a weekly MOR treatment initiated between 22 weeks and 54 weeks post stroke.(2) The patient\u2019s reading rate and accuracy were initially determined for a specific passage of a leveled text series. Homework included repeated daily readings of a single passage for 30 minutes. During the course of treatment, the subject\u2019s reading rate increased as his error rate decreased. Other case studies examining MOR with patients with pure dyslexia indicate that this treatment is most beneficial with patients who have intact or recovered letter processing ability and a need to improve whole-word  recognition ability(2) -In a study conducted in the United States of MOR involving six patients with acquired dyslexia (four with phonological dyslexia and two with pure dyslexia), treatment consisted of one 2-hour  session per week for 8 weeks(38) -Each week a different passage was trained in the session; untrained control, functor, and content passages were never trained but were tested pre- and post-therapy(38) -In the patients with pure dyslexia, reading rate for novel passages containing a significant number of trained words increased as measured by post-therapy  tests(38) -Researchers concluded that MOR improves reading of untrained passages that overlap trained passages at the level of the patient\u2019s specific deficit(38) .  Problem Goal Intervention Expected Progression Home Program Pure dyslexia Improve recognition of letter combinations and whole words to improve reading abilityEncoding and whole- word recognition approach _ Word recognition can be trained using a small set of words and an errorless learning technique. The therapist shows the patient a set of cards with words (or letter combinations) and says the word while the patient looks at the card. The patient is then asked to repeat the word and is corrected after any mistakes. To further increase word recognition, the therapist can draw an outline around the word and ask the patient to attend to the shape and visual features of the whole word. The patient can trace the shape with a finger(35) _ _ See Treatment summary , aboveTherapy progresses from training recognition of letter combinations to recognition of whole words; as the patient\u2019s reading for trained words improves, the SLP might introduce additional words to training setPatient can practice reading specific words and letter combinations at home  Pure dyslexia Increase accuracy of letter recognition and ability to read single wordsTactile-kinesthetic technique _ To improve word reading, a patient can trace the outline of each letter on a desk, in the air, on a palm, or on the letter itself while saying the letter aloud. The patient may also copy the letter on paper. This technique has been found to facilitate letter recognition and word reading as well as to gradually improve visual recognition ability so that the patient may eventually recognize the letter without the tactile cue.(37,39) This approach encourages the patient to use the strategy of letter-by- letter reading rather than a whole-word approach _ _ See Treatment summary , aboveInitially, the patient is cued to utilize the tactile-kinesthetic technique with all letters when reading; as recognition of the letters improves, the SLP will prompt the patient to say the letters aloud without tracing them firstPatient can practice reading specific words and letters at home  Pure dyslexia Increase reading fluency, word recognition, and reading comprehension by practicing repeated readings of words, sentences, phrases, or text (newspaper articles)Multiple Oral Reading (MOR) _ MOR involves repeated reading practice of the same material over a period of days or weeks. Texts can be chosen by the patient or the patient\u2019s family member or the SLP. The patient practices reading the article aloud with assistance from the therapist or family member. This approach is intended to increase word recognition ability _ _ See Treatment summary , aboveOnce the patient has been trained on specific words or passages, the SLP can introduce novel reading material with significant overlap (i.e., many of the same letters or words) to promote generalization(38)Practice reading specific texts can be performed at home; reading practice can be performed at home for up to 30 minutes at a time(2) Aphasia (as needed) Increase communication skillsAphasia therapy _ For detailed information on treatment of aphasia, see the series of Clinical Reviews on that topicTherapy for aphasia generally progresses from sound level to syllable, word, phrase, sentence, and finally conversational levelHome program will vary with respect to the goals of the patient Dysphagia (as needed) Increase swallow safety Dysphagia therapy _ Therapy will vary according to the results of a swallow evaluation.
