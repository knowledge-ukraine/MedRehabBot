            "Breast cancer is carcinoma of the female or male breast; however, 99% of breast cancers occur in females.(2) Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women in the United States and is second to lung cancer as the most common cause of death related to cancer(19)",

            "Early-stage  cancer (in situ or absence of invasion of the tumor cells into surrounding tissues) includes DCIS, which can progress to Paget\u2019s disease of the nipple, which is a direct extension of DCIS into the lactiferous ducts and adjacent skin(1)",
            "Invasive carcinoma of the breast includes invasive ductal carcinoma (e.g., mucinous, tubular, medullary, micropapillary, papillary, or inflammatory carcinoma) and invasive lobular carcinoma (e.g., tubulolobular carcinoma)(1)",
            "Pregnancy-associated  breast cancercan be diagnosed during pregnancy or up to 12 months postpartum(1)",
            "A breast cancer survivor can have a variety of rehabilitation needs.(20) Many factors will influence the presentation of the individual patient (e.g., age; type of cancer; surgical, radiation, and medical treatment regimen; premorbid health; comorbidities) \u2013Shoulder dysfunction (pain, limited ROM) \u2013Lymphedema \u2013Axillary web syndrome \u2013Pain \u2013Fatigue \u2013Decreased upper extremity (UE) strength and endurance \u2013Impaired sensation",
