There was a decrease in VO 2 peak of 0.24 L/min in the usual-care  group and a decrease of 0.1 L/min in the exercise group \u2013Two participants in the exercise group (N = 14) did not demonstrate a decrease in VO 2 peak after undergoing chemotherapy, whereas all participants in the usual-care  group (N = 14) demonstrated decreases in VO 2 peak despite recommendations to maintain physical activity levels",
            "In an RCT 236 patients with stage II breast cancer were divided into three groups: continuous training at moderate intensity, high-intensity  interval training, and control group. Those in the exercise groups participated in 36 sessions of 70 minutes, 3 times a week (15)  \u2013Significant changes in exercise tolerance, muscle strength, and VO 2 max were observed in both exercise groups, but not in the control group \u2013There was a significant reduction in cancer-related  fatigue in the high-intensity  exercise group only \u2013Overall, the study concluded that high-intensity  interval training is safe and effective for women with stage II breast cancer",
            "Aerobic training is safe but not feasible in patients with metastatic (stage IV) breast cancer. Sixty-five  women with stage IV breast cancer were allocated into an exercise group (N = 33) or a stretching group (N = 32). The exercise program consisted of 36 treadmill walking sessions 3 times a week between 55% and 80% VO 2 peak for 12 weeks. Contrary to hypothesis, aerobic training was not associated with an increase in cardiorespiratory fitness or improvement in patient-reported outcomes (16)"

            "The American Cancer Society (ACS) general guidelines on exercise may help cancer survivors and their families make informed choices on physical activity during the continuum of cancer care. However, in 2018, nearly half (46.7%) of Americans did not meet the recommended amount of moderate to vigorous physical activity (17)",
            "Authors of asmall randomized control trial (N = 17) including female breast cancer survivors compared the effects of moderate-intensity exercise and high-intensity  interval training (HIIT) exercise on cognitive function and found that HIIT may be an effective exercise intervention to improve cognition, aerobic fitness, and cerebrovascular function in female breast cancer survivors (18)"
        ],
        "treatment summary": [
            "The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) exercise program guide for cancer survivors recommends vigorous aerobic exercise for 75 minutes per week or 150 minutes of moderate-intensity  exercise per week, and strength exercise at least 2 days per week (10)",
            "Authors of a 2020 meta-analysis  including 29 studies found that resistance exercise does not have a negative effect on breast-cancer-related  lymphedema (BCRL). In fact, resistance exercises increase muscle strength in patients with BCRL (19)",
            "Patients who engaged in exercise (such as brisk walking) at a rate of nine or greater metabolic equivalents (METs) for 2 to 3 hours a week before and after breast cancer diagnosis had a 45% lower risk of death compared to sedentary individuals (20)",
            "In an RCT that included 2,361 breast cancer survivors, researchers found that the most active women had a 53% lower mortality risk compared to the least active women (20)",
            "Engaging in at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity per week reduced all-cause  mortality by 24% among breast cancer survivors(20)",
            "Patients with very low levels of physical activity (less than or equal to 1.5 METs) demonstrated a 22% increase in breast cancer mortality (20)",
            "In a literature review, authors found that many RCTs and systematic reviews indicated that physical activity has a protective effect against recurrence of and mortality from breast cancer (20)",
            "Weight gain during adulthood or excessive body fat can increase the risk of breast cancer during and after menopause, (21) whereas weight loss may lower the risk of breast cancer (22)",
            "Recommendations from the American Cancer Society (ACS) (17) \u2013Maintain a healthy weight throughout life. Avoid weight gain in adulthood \u2013Be physically active. Adults should aim for 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity  exercise per week or 75 to 150 minutes of vigorous-intensity  physical activity per week. Reaching or exceeding 300 minutes of physical activity is desirable \u2013Children and adolescents should meet or exceed at least 1 hour of moderate or vigorous physical activity per day \u2013Limit sedentary activities, such as screen time, television watching, and lying down \u2013It is recommended to not drink alcohol. Persons who drink alcohol should limit consumption to one drink a day for women and two drinks a day for men  \u2013Follow a healthy diet at all ages, including consuming a variety of fruits, vegetables, and grains while avoiding red and processed meats, sugary drinks, and processed grains",
            "Authors of a systematic review of exercise maintenance in patients with breast cancer found that, of 17 articles reviewed, only 6 demonstrated that significantintervention effects were maintained over time. More research must be done regarding physical activity delivery and mode so that the benefits of physical activity can be maintained in patients with breast cancer (23)",
            "In an observational study (N = 1340 breast cancer survivors post chemotherapy) investigators found that meeting the minimum guidelines for physical activity reduced mortality and recurrence of breast cancer. Meeting minimum guidelines had similar advantages in overall survival compared with meeting and exceeding the guidelines (24)",
            "Authors of an RCT (N = 143) conducted a study of breast cancer patients during adjuvant therapy (25) \u2013The Adapted Physical Activity and Diet (APAD) intervention was evaluated against usual care to determine its effectiveness at decreasing fatigue, anxiety, depression, BMI, and fat mass and enhancing muscular performance and overall QoL \u2013Participants in the APAD intervention group participated in moderate-intensity  exercise 3 times a week and consulted with a dietitian 9 times \u2013Patient-reported  outcomes were measured at baseline, 18 weeks (after chemotherapy), and 26 weeks (end of radiotherapy and intervention), as well as 6 and 12 months post intervention \u2013Significant beneficial effects were observed in all patient-reported  outcomes (depression, anxiety, fatigue, QoL) at 18 and 26 weeks. Positive effects on fatigue and QoL persisted at 12-month  follow-up \u2013At 26 weeks, significant positive effects were observed in BMI, fat mass, and increased muscular endurance, but these did not persist when tested at 6 months or 12 months post intervention \u2013Overall conclusions were that a diet and exercise intervention should begin during early stages of breast cancer diagnosis",
            "van der Leeden et al. explored the importance of comorbidities associated with breast cancer and tailoring an individual exercise program based on these comorbidities. They list possible adaptations to exercise based on comorbidity in their study (26) \u2013Appropriate hygiene or home exercise program for individuals with leukopenia \u2013Avoiding high impact exercises and avoiding point pressure when using equipment for individuals with thrombopenia \u2013Avoid using dumbbells with individuals with loss of sensation in the upper extremities due to risk of dropping them",
            "Thirty-six  studies were included in a systematic review that examined the effects of exercise on QoL in patients with breast cancer (27) \u2013Twenty-two  of 25 studies reported a significant positive effect of aerobic exercise on QoL in patients with breast cancer \u2013Seven of 8 studies reported a significant positive effect of resistance training on QoL in patients with breast cancer. These studies also described the positive effects of combined aerobic and resistance exercise on QoL \u2013Increased adherence to the intervention was associated with improved fatigue, physical well-being,  and QoL \u2013Eight of 12 studies reported that exercising beyond the recommended 150 minutes was associated with a decreased risk of adverse events in breast cancer patients as well as improved QoL \u2013Eight of 11 studies that examined lymphedema found that aerobic and resistance exercise had no negative effects on existing lymphedema and did not cause lymphedema",
            "Home-based  exercise training \u2013Authors of an RCT (N = 82 breast cancer patients) found that adherence to a home-based  exercise intervention was 55 percent. Lower adherence was observed in patients who were obese or who had average or below-average  lower body strength (28) \u2013Authors of an RCT (N = 351 overweight breast cancer survivors) found that a facility-based  program may be more beneficial than an at-home  exercise program for improving lymphedema outcomes (29) \u2013Authors of an RCT in Taiwan (N = 159 women in stages I\u2013III of breast cancer who experience insomnia, pain, fatigue, or depression) found that an at-home  brisk walking program reduced fatigue in women with breast cancer who were undergoing chemotherapy (30)",
            "Progressive resistance training (PRE) \u2013Authors of an RCT studying women undergoing breast cancer surgery with axillary lymph node dissection (N = 158) found no evidence that progressive resistance exercise (PRE) can prevent lymphedema in the first year after breast cancer diagnosis but found that PRE is safe for women with breast cancer (31)  \u2013In an RCT including 158 women researchers found that a 50-week  PRE intervention (supervised for the first 20 weeks and self-administered  for the next 30 weeks) had significant effects on social and emotional functioning and also had a positive impact on pain, sleep, and fatigue (32) \u2013Authors of an RCT of women with breast cancer who underwent axillary lymph node dissection found that PRE provided no benefit in reducing arm pain postoperatively.
