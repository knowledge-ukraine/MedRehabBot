            "Cervical strain/sprain (CSS) is characterized by neck stiffness, muscle tenderness, and mechanical neck pain. Injury to ligaments and spinal elements can contribute to chronic neck disability(1)",
            "The mechanism of injury is trauma to supporting structures of the neck, usually by sudden uncontrolled acceleration-deceleration (\u201cwhiplash\u201d) of the head,(1) or repetitive overuse due in part to suboptimal head posture at work (2)",
            "Along with cervicalgia (and sometimes headache), the chief functional concerns in CSS are reduced mobility, weakness, and postural deficits",
            "Early mobilization and conservative interventions that include pain management, therapeutic exercises, manual therapy, and posture re-education  are associated with improved outcomes(3)",
            "Concurrent ligament and/or joint sprain may go undetected on initial assessment, resulting in the use of therapeutic strategies that are not completely effective",
            "Injuries can be acute, with a full recovery, or chronic, with long-term  pain, disability, and healthcare utilization(1)",
            "Neck injuries due to motor vehicle accidents can also result in fractures, disc injuries, or neurologic deficits; however, CSS excludes these symptoms(3)",
            "This Clinical Review does not cover CSS in patients with preexisting conditions such as cervical spondylosis, ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, Down syndrome, etc.",

            "Direct or indirect high-energy  trauma\u2013MV A collision-induced  loading of the neck-In a rear-end  MV A, both the upper and lower cervical spine experience flexion in the first stage. In the second stage,the neck begins to extend, forming an S-shape  and reforming the lordotic curve of the spine. In stage three the wholecervical spine is in full extension, which causes shearing forces on the facet joints(1)-Research shows that bracing in anticipation of an MV A can reduce potential injury and leads to better long-termoutcomes. Bracing helps to protect discs and ligaments and decreases gross head movement(5,6)\u2013Sports injuries(7)",

            "The forced eccentric lengthening reaction (i.e., hyperflexion or hyperextension) in whiplash injuries probably overstretchesand tears soft tissue, resulting in classic strain/sprain pathology(5)",
            "Muscle injuries occur as a function of pre-activation,  the magnitude of strain, and initial muscle length, all of which arecorrelated with loss of contractile force(5)",
            "Several studies have shown that in instances of sports injury or vehicle collision, there is a neuromuscular delay betweenhead movement and cervical muscle activation(5)",
            "Hypotheses for whiplash pain(9)\u2013The hyperextension hypothesis:In a study in which rhesus monkeys were subjected to high forward-facing  accelerations,neck hyperextension was associated with whiplash injury. However, this theory does not identify an anatomical cause ofinjury\u2013The muscle hypothesis:Neck extension leads to stretching of the cervical flexors, which are often contracting eccentricallyand therefore are prone to injury. Muscle injury occurs when contracted muscles are lengthened. As the neck extends, thecervical extensors are being compressed and are unlikely to be injured\u2013The muscle flexion hypothesis:Cervical extensor muscles are injured during hyperflexion of the cervical spine after initialimpact\u2013The pinching hypothesis:Pain is due to pinching of the capsule of the facet joint between the facet joint articular cartilage\u2013The pressure hypothesis:There is a change in volume of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) around the spinal cord during neckflexion that cannot be dissipated by CSF flow, which can lead to damage of the nerve roots as they exit the spinal cord\u2013The shear hypothesis:A rear-end  MV A pushes the thoracic spine forward, thus reducing the kyphotic curve of the thoracicspine. Straightening of the thoracic spine causes compression in the cervical spine as it attempts to push the head up. Thecompression of the cervical spine causes cervical ligaments to slacken and releases tension in the cervical spine, whichcan lead to deformation of cervical spine tissues as the head and neck undergo hyperextension and hyperflexion as seen intypical whiplash injuries-This is the most valid hypothesis",
            "Bracing for impact was shown to be key in reducing head kinematics in a simulated sports-injury  scenario(6)",
            "Whiplash injury is usually a vehicle-related  neck strain/sprain. Approximately 50% of cases resolve without chronicsequelae. However, 14% to 42% of patients continue to experience persistent pain and functional limitations longer than 6months. Ten percent of these patients have constant, severe pain. The continuing syndrome of psychophysical symptomsafter acute whiplash injury is termed whiplash-associated  disorder (WAD)(10)",
            "Forces from a lateral impact of the head and neck with simultaneous depression of the shoulder may cause stretching orpinching of the brachial plexus nerves, causing neuropraxia.

            "A study performed in the United States determined the effect of an acoustic stimulus on posture and muscle activation prior to a head perturbation (similar to a whiplash injury).

Combining these interventions with exercise has been found to be effective in restoring function, resulting in both long-  and short-term  benefits(19) \u2013Exercises that follow the McKenzie method principle of treatment (centralization, directional preference exercises) have been shown to be effective when compared to patient education alone(20) \u2013Combining neck exercises with general exercise has no added benefit for patients with WAD(20) \u2013Passive therapies (manual therapy, kinesiology taping, acupuncture) are not recommended as first-line  treatment for WAD. Passive therapies can be combined with active exercise for positive treatment results(20) \u2013Authors of a systematic review from 2021 concluded that muscle energy technique (MET) has a good clinical effect when used in combination with a traditional physical therapy approach(21) \u2013Cervical collars or other devices may be used in the acute phase while fracture is being ruled out. However, prolonged use (> 72 hours) can delay mobilization and facilitate tightening of soft tissue (1) \u2013Patient education to promote awareness of good posture and head positioning(19) .
