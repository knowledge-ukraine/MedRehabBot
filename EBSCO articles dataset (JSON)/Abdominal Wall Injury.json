            "Indirect trauma is the main cause of abdominal muscle strain that occurs when the abdominal muscles are involved inan unusual forceful activity or movement.(13)For example, forceful trunk side flexion with axial rotation as in throwing(e.g., javelin or discus) or swinging (e.g., tennis, volleyball, ice hockey, golf, baseball) can cause abdominal muscle strain,particularly of the internal oblique(1,2,14)",
            "Forceful eccentric action of the internal oblique was associated with strain of the stretched contralateral external oblique ina soccer player(15)",
            "Blunt trauma from occupational and vehicular accidents, falls, and contact sports (especially martial arts, wrestling, andboxing) is the primary cause of severe gross abdominal muscle fiber/tendon tearing and contusion",
            "Mild-to-moderate  abdominal strains can be caused by unaccustomed repetitive abdominal muscle exertion (as in sit-ups,rowing, or climbing). Such exercise-related  strains often produce DOMS, which is characterized by soreness that worsensduring the first 24 to 48 hours, peaks, and then resolves spontaneously.(3,4) Straining weakened abdominal muscles incompression (e.g., defecation) might also provoke injury",
            "Excessive subcutaneous fat or chronic bloating may overstretch the abdominal wall, leading to muscle weakness and eventearing of the linea alba(3)"
        ],
        "pathogenesis": [
            "The hallmark of muscle strain is microscopic tearing or pulling apart of myofibers",
            "The author of a cohort study (N = 55 patients with chronic abdominal wall pain) in Germany found that the most commonsites of pain were:(13)\u2013linea semilunaris on either side of the rectus abdominis (71%)\u2013linea alba between xiphoid and umbilicus (13%)\u2013rectus abdominis (9%)\u2013costal margins of the ribs (7%)",
            "Electron microscopy reveals that tearing usually occurs at the Z-lines  of myofibrils in series. The likely mechanism ofthis myofibrillar tearing is overstretching during eccentric (anti-gravity)  work.(4) For example, eccentric stretching of theabdominal muscles opposes gravity during the \u201cdown phase\u201d of sit-ups",
            "Pain-restricted  functional mobility in the acute and subacute stages (< 2 weeks) is associated with deficits in abdominalwall flexibility and strength",

        "risk factors": [
            "Sudden or repetitive eccentric exercise is a risk factor for abdominal strains. In addition, abdominal muscle fatigue andpoor fitness increase risk of injury. The risk of abdominal wall tears might, therefore, be higher at the beginning of acore-strengthening program(1,2)",
            "Obesity, anxiety, and depression may increase the risk for pain in the lineasemilunaris, linea alba, and costal arch of the ribcage, based on a study of patients in a gastroenterology clinic in Germany(3)",
            "Authors in the United States who conducted a descriptive epidemiological study including baseball players from 1991 to2010 found that abdominal muscle strains made up 5% (n = 393) of all injuries and that nearly all (92%) of these wereinternal/external oblique or intercostal strains. Injuries were commonly contralateral to the dominant arm or batting sideand were attributed to rotational forces(5)",
            "Authors of a case study in Argentina found that the one-handed backhand swing in tennis was associated with an internaloblique strain in a professional player (2)",
