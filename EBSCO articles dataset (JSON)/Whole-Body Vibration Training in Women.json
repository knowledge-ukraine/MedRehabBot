Alternative treatment intervention for patients who have chronic pain, fibromyalgia, decreased bone mineral density (BMD), or pelvic floor muscle weakness treatment(11) -Fifty-one  healthy men and women subjects participated in the study and were randomly allocated to 5 different vibration-frequency  groups -The highest levels of muscle activation were found at high frequencies and large amplitudes. WBV frequency of 30 Hz led to significant increase in muscle activation (especially the quadriceps femoris) compared to the other frequencies  -Knee angle significantly affects only the quadriceps femoris and not hamstrings -EMG muscle activity ranged from 18.2% to 74.1% maximal voluntary contraction in the quadriceps and from 5.2% to 27.3% maximal voluntary contraction in the hamstrings \u2013WBV with low frequency might increase trunk extensor strength in healthy adults(17) -Researchers in China assessed trunk extensor strength in healthy adults immediately after 3 sessions of WBV with differing frequencies -There was a significant increase in trunk extensor strength immediately after exercising with WBV at low frequency (25Hz) compared to high frequency (40Hz) and a significant decrease in trunk extensor endurance after high frequency -Statistical sex differences occurred; males were more sensitive than females in trunk extensor endurance for lower frequency WBV \u2013Six weeks of strength training in conjunction with WBV does not further improve maximum dynamic strength in long-distance  runners compared to the same strength-training program without WBV(12) -Based on a Brazilian randomized controlled study of 22 long-distance  runners who were placed in 3 groups: strength training, strength training with WBV , and control group -Strength training included half-squats,  twice a week, with a gradual increase in the number of sets (3, 4, 6) and repetitions (8\u201310,  6\u20138, 4\u20136),  with the program changing every 2 weeks over a 6-week  period. Loads were calculated to ~70% of 1-repetition maximum as subjects\u2019 strength improved over the training period -Subjects performed the strength training on the WBV platform but the platform was turned on only for the WBV group. The frequency increased, from 30\u201335Hz  to 35\u201340Hz  to 40\u201350Hz,  every 2 weeks over the 6-week period for the WBV group -Both strength-training  groups statistically improved maximum dynamic strength (~18%) -There was a statistical difference in aerobic endurance (~25%) in the strength-training  group compared to the other two groups \u2013Researchers from Brazil suggest that WBV training can improve strength of the vastus lateralis (VL) muscle in women(33) -Frequency of WBV set to either 30 Hz or 50 Hz while participants held a semi-squat  position -Surface EMG (sEMG) measured the amplitude of the VL with WBV or no vibration -Researchers concluded that there was a significant difference in sEMG amplitude of the VL during WBV training, with no differences between the two frequencies \u2013A short-term  WBV training program along with creatine supplementation can improve isotonic strength of the lower extremities and improve dynamic balance in older adult women(35) -Based on a study conducted in Iran involving 22 healthy women between the ages of 60 and 80 -Participants were randomly assigned to either the WBV group plus creatine (n = 11) or the WBV with placebo (n = 11) -The WBV group plus creatine performed their activity for 10 days while also consuming 20g of oral creatine supplements daily for the first 5 days and reduced to 5g for the next 5 days -The WBV group with placebo performed their activities for 10 days -The 30-meter  walking and tandem gait tests were used to assess mobility and the flamingo and TUG test were used to assess static and dynamic balance -At the end of the study, isometric strength and 30-meter  walking performance was significantly improved in the WBV plus creatine group compared to WBV only Muscle power \u2013In a meta-analysis  assessing the effects of vibration on muscular power in healthy individuals, pooled data from 7 studies (n = 249) showed that WBV significantly increased countermovement jump height compared to control group (18) Pain management \u2013Authors of a 2017 RCT conducted in Turkey investigated the effects of WBV on pain, depression, and quality of life in women with fibromyalgia (n = 20)(2) -The participants were randomized into 2 groups, an intervention group(exercise combined with WBV) and control group (exercise only) -Outcome measures included V AS, Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) administered at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months post intervention -Exercise protocol included dynamic and static contractions of muscles of lower extremities. Participants performed static squat with 100\u02da knee flexion and dynamic squat between 90\u02da and 130\u02da of knee flexion; ankle  dorsiflexion-extension  with 100\u02da of knee flexion and squat at 100\u02da knee flexion, shifting body weight from one leg to another. Each exercise was performed for 30 seconds x 6 repetitions, with a recovery of 3 minutes between repetitions -Platform settings were 30 Hz frequency with 2 mm amplitude -Duration of training was 2x/week for 4 weeks -The FIQ scores were significantly better in the intervention group at 6-month  assessment. No significant differences were found in V AS or BDI \u2013Authors of a 2018 systematic review conducted in Brazil investigated the effects of WBV training on pain, fatigue, and quality of life in women with fibromyalgia and found inconclusive evidence on improving pain, fatigue, and quality of life(34) \u2013Researchers from Spain in 2015 conducted an RCT to investigate the effects of WBV on quality of life in older adult women (n = 37) (38) -Authors hypothesized that intervention may improve quality of life, falls risk, and cognitive status -Participants were randomly assigned to WBV group or control group. The WBV group performed 18 exercises in different positions on a vertical vibration platform 2x/week for 8 weeks. The control group did not participate in any training program -Assessments were performed at baseline and 8 months for all participants. Outcome measures used included evaluation of falls risk and cognitive status (abbreviated mental test score) and questionnaires on life satisfaction (Lawton\u2019s morale scale) and health-related  quality of life (SF-36  HRQoL) -Authors found no significant improvements in any outcome measures after completion of WBV training \u2013WBV might assist with decreasing pain in patients with chronic Achilles tendinopathy(10) -Based on a study conducted in Germany that involved 58 recreational runners with chronic Achilles tendinopathy who were randomized into 3 groups: WBV , eccentric training, or wait-and-see  approach -Subjects participated in training sessions 3 times a week for 12weeks. WBV group participated in a 1-minute  warm-up in which subjects moved from bipedal stance, heel rises, and stepping in place with slight knee flexion on vibration platform set at 13 Hz to 18Hz and amplitude of 0.4 mm to 0.6mm. Training phase gradually increased from 4\u20135 minutes to 6\u20137 minutes and the vibration frequency and amplitude increased from 16 Hz to 21 Hz and 0.5 mm to 0.8mm while subjects performed bilateral heel-rise  activities. Cooldown included unilateral gastrocsoleus static stretching off the base of the vibration platform -The exercise group participated in eccentric gastrocsoleus strengthening with their heels off the edge of the vibration platform, 3 sets of 15 repetitions on each leg. Those who did not have any symptoms after 3 sets performed a fourth set with gradual increased load by wearing a backpack in which weights were placed -Pain improvements at the midsection of the tendon were greater in the vibration and exercise groups compared to the wait-and-see  group. However, pain improvements at the musculotendinous junction were greatest in the eccentric training group Balance \u2013WBV in conjunction with squat training can improve physical function (strength and balance) in older adults with knee osteoarthritis and/or spondylosis(9) -Based on a Japanese RCT in which 35 ambulatory patients (mean age of 72.4 years) were divided into 2 groups, WBV exercise alone and WBV exercise plus squat training -A 4-minute  WBV exercise (frequency 20Hz) was performed twice a week in both groups and the squat training group performed 20 squats per minute over a 6-month  period -WBV alone improved patients\u2019 body balance and 10-m walking velocity; however, WBV squat exercise was more effective at improving chair-rising  time (5-repetition  chair-rising  time) and 10-m  tandem gait step number \u2013Researchers of a 2015 RCT in Germany investigated the effects of WBV on postural stability in Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) (39) -56 participants with PD were randomly assigned to either experimental (WBV) or control (sham) group. Participants in the experimental group received 4 series of 660-second  stimulus trains of WBV over 8 days. The control group received a sham treatment -The vibration parameters were 7 Hz with a 3 mm amplitude -The primary outcome measure was postural stability assessed by dynamicposturography -Secondary outcome measures included the pull test, TUG, Tinetti, 8MW test, and targeted items on the Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale that addressed speech, facial expression, tremor, and bradykinesia  -Researchers found that postural stability in the experimental group improved by 17.5% compared to the sham group. Rigor, bradykinesia, and tremor also improved, but the difference between groups was not significant \u2013Researchers of an RCT in New Zealand concluded that WBV in conjunction with traditional physiotherapy might improve function but not fall risk in frail older persons(29) -Fifty-six  patients at an inpatient rehabilitation facility with a mean age of 82.01 years were randomly assigned to receive WBV (frequency 30\u201350 Hz, amplitude 2\u20135 mm) and traditional physiotherapy or traditional physiotherapy only -Traditional exercise consisted of 30\u201345-minute therapy sessions, 5 days a week until discharge. WBV consisted of 3 sessions a week until discharge -Outcome measures included the FIM and Modified Falls Efficacy Scale (MFES). The Psychological Profile Assessment (PPA) was the primary outcome measure selected to assess fall risk -Compared to the control group, WBV in conjunction with typical physiotherapy demonstrated statistically superior outcome scores on the FIM and MFES but not on the PPA \u2013WBV in conjunction with a traditional exercise program is a safe intervention but yields similar benefits for balance, strength, gait, and functional ability as traditional exercise alone in institutionalized older adults(28) -Approximately 160 participants from 10 centers in Spain were included in this study; approximately half of the participants were included in the WBV plus exercise group; approximately half were assigned to the control group and participated in exercise on a stable surface only -All participants in both groups performed the same exercises. The groups differed on whether they performed the exercises on a stable surface or a vibrating (WBV) surface. WBV had a frequency of 30\u201335  Hz and an amplitude of 2\u20134 mm. Interventions were performed in 30-minute  sessions, 3 times per week for 6 weeks -Outcome measures were taken at baseline, 6 weeks, and 6 months after the study. The primary outcome measurement was balance. Secondary measurements were strength and number of falls. Specific measures included the Tinetti, TUG, Sit-to-Stand  (STS) test, and number of falls -Tinetti scores significantly improved over time in both groups with no statistical significance noted between groups. TUG scores did not improve in either group over the assessment periods. Muscle performance (STS) testing improved in both groups over time with no statistical significance between groups. Fifty-seven  falls were reported over the assessment period with no significant differences noted between groups \u2013WBV training might improve balance and ankle function in female dancers(4) -Based on a 6-week  RCT in the United Kingdom involving 38 female dancers with ankle instability -Subjects were asked to perform single-leg  exercises (heel raises, leg squats), increasing the duration and vibration frequency as training progressed -Settings for the WBV platform were 30 Hz for 10 minutes and progressed each week until frequency was set at 40 Hz -At the end of the study, the vibration group had a greater improvement in anterior, anteromedial, and anterolateral ankle stability than the control group. However, there were no statistically significant differences in posterior, posteromedial, and posterolateral ankle stability between the groups. There were also no statistically significant differences in the mean power frequency between the vibration group and the control group Function and gait parameters \u2013Researchers of a 2019 systematic review investigated the effects of WBV on flexibility and muscle stiffness (44) -Twenty-four  articles met inclusion criteria. Authors found all but one article showed an increase in flexibility due to WBV; data on muscle stiffness were inconclusive \u2013Researchers of a randomized controlled preliminary study in China concluded that WBV training and quadriceps strengthening exercise (QSE) were effective in improving gait parameters and function in patients with medial compartment knee osteoarthritis(30) -Thirty-nine  patients were randomly assigned to receive WBV training and QSE or QSE alone -Outcome measures were taken at baseline, 12 weeks, and 16 weeks and included the V AS for pain, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), TUG, 6-minute  walk distance test (6MWD), and 3-dimensional gait analysis -Compared to baseline, both groups showed significant improvements in V AS, WOMAC, TUG, 6MWD, and spatiotemporal gait parameters at 12 and 16 weeks. Compared to the control group, the WBV and QSE group showed superior improvements in the WOMAC (physical function), TUG, 6MWD, and cadence at 12 weeks. No differences were found between groups in the V AS, WOMAC (pain, stiffness scales), or spatiotemporal parameters at 12 and 16 weeks See Description, Indications of device/equipment , and Guidelines for use of device/equipment , above  .

            "Results of published research are mixed on the effects of WBV on BMD, strength, balance, and pain. Further research needs to be conducted to assess the efficacy of WBV on these factors as well as the optimal WBV frequency, amplitude, and duration in order to develop the best possible training protocols",
            "It is difficult to recommend a combination of WBV training and other exercises to augment training effects in athletes due to the inconsistency in the results of published literature(16)",
            "BMD \u2013Researchers of a 2016 meta-analysis  and systematic review investigated the effects of WBV on reduction of bone loss and fall prevention in postmenopausal women. They concluded that low-magnitude  WBV therapy can significantly improve bone loss in the lumbar spine in postmenopausal women; WBV can also be used as an intervention for fall prevention(32) -Eight studies with a total of 1,014 patients were included in the data \u2013Belgian researchers concluded that there was no difference between WBV training and vitamin D supplementation in enhancing muscle mass, strength, and hip BMD in women older than 70 years(14) -Based on a study of 113 institutionalized women > 70 years who were randomly assigned to either a WBV or a no-training  group, receiving either a conventional dose (880IU/day) or a high dose (1,600 IU/day) of vitamin D -The women participated in a 6-month  treatment intervention. Those in the WBV group performed static and dynamic exercises (5 different squat techniques) with a gradual increase in training load according to the overload principle, 3 times a week  -After 6 months of treatment, dynamic muscle strength, hip BMD, and vitamin D serum levels improved significantly in all groups, but isometric muscle strength and muscle mass did not change -There was no statistical difference between the WBV group and either of the vitamin D supplementation groups -There was no difference in hip BMD, muscle mass, or strength between the high dose and standard dose of vitamin D; however, there were higher serum levels of vitamin D in the higher dose group \u2013Eight months of WBV training twice a week did not increase BMD of octogenarian women, in an RCT conducted in Spain(26) -Thirty-seven  women were assigned to a vibration group that trained on a vibration platform twice a week or to a control group that did not participate in any training -Bone mass was measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) at the hip region -No statistically significant changes in bone mass were found in any hip region (total hip, femoral neck, trochanter, intertrochanter, Ward\u2019s area) \u2013Bone quality was not improved in osteopenic postmenopausal women after 12 months of WBV , in a study conducted in Canada(27) -Twenty-two  women who received WBV training for 2\u20133sessions per week were compared to 20 women who were controls -Bone outcomes were measured with CT scans at baseline, 4, 8, and 12 months -Total BMD, cortical area, cortical thickness, and cortical porosity all significantly decreased over time in both groups -WBV training did not lead to improved bone quality compared to controls and there were no detected benefits related to balance and muscle strength outcomes \u2013Researchers of a 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis  of RCTs investigated the effects of WBV training on femoral neck and lumbar spine BMD in postmenopausal women(36) -10 studies with 14 WBV groups met inclusion criteria -The BMD of 462 postmenopausal women who performed WBV",
            "or control protocol was evaluated Authors found no significant pre to post effect on total BMD between intervention and control groups. However, there was significant pre-post  improvement in the BMD of the lumbar spine in the WBV group compared with control groups. \u2013WBV training might help maintain BMD but not increase it(5) -Based on a study in Greece involving 32 postmenopausal women who were assigned to WBV training, exercise, or control groups -Women in the WBV group received intervention on WBV platform 3x a week for 6 months, with the first 4 months set at 35 Hz with 1.5 mm amplitude and the last 2 months set at 40 Hz with 1.5 mm amplitude -WBV group performed single limb balance with knees slightly bent for 3 sets of 45\u201360  seconds for the first 4 months followed by 60\u201380  seconds in the last 2 months and the recovery period set at 1 minute. The exercise group performed strengthening exercises twice a week and cardiorespiratory endurance once a week -There were no statistically significant differences between the WBV group, training group, and control group in terms of body composition, BMD, and muscle strength",
            "Strength \u2013WBV in conjunction with squat training can improve physical function (strength and balance) in older adults with knee osteoarthritis and/or spondylosis -Based on a Japanese RCT trial in which 35 ambulatory patients (mean age of 72.4 years) were divided into 2 groups, WBV exercise alone and WBV exercise plus squat training -A 4-minute  WBV exercise (frequency 20Hz) was performed twice a week in both groups and the squat training group performed 20 squats per minute over a 6-month  period -WBV alone improved patients\u2019 body balance and 10-m walking velocity; however, WBV squat exercise was more effective at improving chair-rising  time (5-repetition  chair-rising  time) and 10-m  tandem gait step number \u2013Researchers of an RCT in China compared WBV with eyes open, visual-field-deprived  WBV (eyes closed), and a control group (0 Hz, eyes open) and concluded that visual-field-deprived WBV and WBV with eyes open produced the greatest balance and lower extremity strength gains in older adult participants(31) -Forty-five  older adult subjects with an average age of 69.2 participated in this study -WBV training (20 Hz, 4 mm) was performed 3 times per week, 5 minutes each session for 3 months  -Participants were assessed at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. Assessments included knee flexor and extensor dynamometry and limits of stability via Biodex Balance System -Post-training  knee flexor and extensor muscle strength significantly improved in the visual-field-deprived  WBV group, with strength gains of 19.40% and 37.89%, respectively. Only the knee extensor strength of the WBV group with eyes open improved, increasing by 15.40%. There was no significant strength improvement found in the control group -Balance outcomes were significantly improved at 3 and 6 months in the visual-field-deprived  WBV and WBV groups compared to the control group. The greatest balance improvement was seen in the visual-field-deprived  WBV group \u2013A stochastic pattern of vibration might be more effective than a sinusoidal pattern in strengthening weakened pelvic floor muscles and can achieve higherpelvic floor muscle activation(6) -Researchers in Brazil in 2019 conducted a systematic review of the literature to investigate the effect of WBV exercises on the pelvic floor muscles in healthy and unhealthy individuals -Six studies were included with a total of 189 participants,age range 18\u201368  years, including 2 studies of healthy individuals and 4 of individuals with pelvic floor dysfunction -The literature supports that WBV in conjunction with exercise can improve pelvic floor muscle strength and quality of life in individuals with urinary incontinence(6) \u2013Researchers in Iran in 2015 conducted a randomized control trial to investigate the effects of WBV therapy on pelvic floor muscle training on women\u2019s stress urinary incontinence (SUI) (41) -Participants (n = 43) were randomly assisted to two groups, WBVtraining (WBVT) (n = 21)and pelvic floor muscle training (PVMT) (n = 22) -Participants participated in a 4-week  training program, exercising 3x/week. Participants in the WBVT group performed exercises on a vibration platform and those in the PVMT group performed exercises off the platform under supervision -Exercise protocol consisted of isometric contractions of hip adductors, gluteals, abdominals in supine, sitting, standing hook-lying,  bridging, mini-squatting,  and squatting positions. Each group performed 3\u20134 sets of 15\u201320  repetitions,with a 60-second  pause between sets -Prior to beginning testing protocol, participants were educated on how to maximally contract pelvic floor muscles in supine position. Pelvic floor muscle (PFM) maximum strength was assessed by digital palpation of a physical therapist trained in pelvic floor muscle evaluation -Additional outcome measures includedaV AS rating the severity of SUI (0 = no incontinence, 10 = severe incontinence) and the Incontinence Quality of Life (I-QOL)  questionnaire (22 items evaluating concerns related to SUI using a 5-point Likert scale). All were assessed at baseline and post intervention -Results showed WBVT protocol was effective in improving pelvic floor muscle strength and reducing severity of incontinence and improving I-QOL; however, no significant differences were found between groups \u2013In a 2017 RCT in Puerto Rico, researchers investigated the effects of WBV on body fat, heart rate, and strength in obese (n = 27) postmenopausal women(15) -Participants were randomly assigned to either WBV training (n = 13) or a non-exercising  control group (n = 14) -Heart rate, muscle strength,and body composition were measured before and after 6 weeks of intervention -Participants in the WBV training performed four static and four dynamic leg exercises on a vibration platform 3x/week for 6 weeks -Training volume increased over the 6 weeks by increasing intensity of vibration from 25 to 40 Hz and amplitude from 1 to 2 mm and increasing duration of exercise from 30 to 60 seconds and number of sets from 3 to 7 -Researchers found a significant decrease in percent body fat, decreased resting heart rate, and increased strength in intervention group vs control \u2013In a systematic review and meta-analysis  of RCTs that investigated effects of WBV on lean body mass in postmenopausal women, authors found no significant improvements in lean mass with BWT and no significant difference between intervention and control group (37) \u2013German researchers conducted a study to systematically analyze the impact of vibration frequencies, amplitudes, and knee angles on quadriceps femoris and hamstring activity during WBV in order to better develop training protocols for WBV"
