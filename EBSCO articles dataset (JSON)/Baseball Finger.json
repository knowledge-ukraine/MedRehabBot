            "The authors of a study conducted in South Korea found that poor health literacy (i.e., poor ability to process and understand health information to make appropriate health decisions) is correlated with greater extensor lag and treatment dissatisfaction in mallet finger injury.(23) Providing patient education and confirming the patient\u2019s understanding of the information provided may help to improve health literacy . Problem Goal Intervention Expected Progression Home Program Pain, swelling, and tenderness on dorsum of distal phalanxResolve pain, swelling, and tendernessPhysical agents and mechanical modalities _ Rest, ice, compression, elevation (RICE) therapy may help relieve pain and swelling in acute injury. Retrograde massage _ _ Electrotherapeutic modalities _ Evidence is lacking to support the use of electrotherapeutic modalitiesPhysical agents may be used as necessary to relieve pain and swelling pending physician approvalProvide the patient with written instructions on the correct application of splint/ orthosis, proper care of finger, and RICE techniques(23)  Weakness in DIP joint function _ Inability to extend DIP joint to 0\u00b0Normal DIP joint functionTherapeutic exercises _ Begin gentle assisted active ROM after a continuous splinting period of at least 6 weeks,and physician orders are received _ _ If no significant extensor lag (more than 10\u00b0) is evident, continue with slow active ROM to 10\u2013 15\u00b0 DIP flexion, several times daily, and progress by 10\u2013 15\u00b0 flexion per week. Progress to passive ROM and gentle resistance exercises _ _ Passive flexion of the DIP joint often is avoided until the second week of nighttime-only splinting(9) _ _ Functional training _ Introduce finger prehension and dexterity coordination exercises as per physician ordersGradual progression of the intensity of exercises as deemed appropriate (and ordered by a physician) until normal functionality is restoredProvide patient and family/caregivers with written instructions regarding therapeutic exercises and functional activities that can be performed at home(23) ."

        "Follow-up  exams should be performed at 2-week  intervals until the injury is healed. Follow-up  radiographs need to be taken for bony mallet finger injuries. Night splinting may or may not be recommended for 2 to 3 additional weeks after tendon has healed(11) In a 2014 RCT in the United States of the efficacy of night splinting following 6 to 8 weeks of continuous splinting, researchers concluded that night splinting did not improve outcomes of extensor lag, disability, or overall patient satisfaction(13) \u2013Fifty-one  subjects were placed randomly in the no-splint group or the intervention group (night splint). Outcome measures were taken after subjects in the intervention group wore the splint for 4 continuous weeks -There are methodologic limitations with this study that should be considered when interpreting its findings, including small sample size and inconsistent treatment adherence \u2013Results indicated that subjects with worse initial extensor lags had poorer results compared to those with less of an extensor lag following the night splinting \u2013Final degree of extensor lag correlated with age, DIP flexionand extension ROM, and degree of extensor lag after the period of 6 to 8 weeks of continuous splinting",
