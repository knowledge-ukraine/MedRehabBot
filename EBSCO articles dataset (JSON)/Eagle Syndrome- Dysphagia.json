            "Eagle syndrome is characterized by a group of symptoms including recurrent throat and ear pain, globus (the sensation of a foreign body in the throat), occipital pain, dysphagia, and/or facial pain.(1,2,3,4) Eagle syndrome results from either an elongated styloid process of the temporal bone (greater than 3 cm in length) or a calcified stylohyoid ligament.(1,5,6) All individuals with elongated styloid processes will not necessarily be symptomatic, and the length of the styloid process does not directly correlate with the amount of pain experienced by an individual patient.(2,7) The syndrome is named for Watt W. Eagle, who coined the term stylalgia to describe the pain associated with Eagle syndrome.(2) There are two types of Eagle syndrome:",

            "Dysphagia refers to impaired swallowing due to an inability to move food efficiently during the oral, pharyngeal, or esophageal phase of swallowing.(10) The oral phase includes sucking, chewing, and moving food or liquid into the throat. The pharyngeal phase is the initiation of the swallowing reflex, when food or liquid is squeezed down the throat and the airway is closed off to prevent aspiration (food or liquid entering the airway) or choking. In the esophageal phase, the openings at the top and bottom of the esophagus move food or liquid into the stomach by relaxing and  tightening.(11) Eagle syndrome can occur unilaterally or bilaterally (most typically it occurs unilaterally) and most frequently causes headache, pain on rotation of the neck, pain on extension of the tongue, change in voice, odynophagia (pain with swallowing), swelling, and a sensation of hypersalivation, all of which can interfere with normal swallowing and result in dysphagia.(2,7,22,23,24) In addition to causing pain, Eagle syndrome sometimes results in impaired sensation in the larynx which can lead to silent aspiration (the absence of coughing or throat clearing when material penetrates below the level of the vocal folds).(24) Authors of a case study reported a case of a 60-year-old  female with Eagle syndrome who had bilateral elongation of the styloid processes, but only experienced symptoms unilaterally(22) Causes, Pathogenesis, & Risk Factors"

All patients should be examined in the lateral and frontal positions to gain information on movements of the swallow and symmetry of bolus flow and pharyngeal wall contraction. The SLP examines for the presence of aspiration and the effectiveness of presenting different  food consistencies or of modifying posture.(11) Most clinical practices follow the protocol originally described by Logemann(19) -In patients with Eagle syndrome, the elongated styloid process might be visible in the lateral view on a VFSS(23)Modified BariumT709046(24) FEES is performed to evaluate the anatomy and physiology of the pharynx and the larynx, pharyngeal swallow function, and the patient\u2019s ability to manage secretions and swallow foods and liquids.(11) In addition, it can be used to explore a variety of diagnostic interventions, such as varying bolus consistency, varying posture, or making use of visual feedback for reinforcement.(25) After the insertion of the endoscope, the patient can engage in normal feeding behavior during the evaluation. Food must be light in color to enhance visibility (e.g., milk, puddings, yogurt, bread). FEES is preferred over VFSS when patients have safety issues related to radiation exposure or when they need retesting.
