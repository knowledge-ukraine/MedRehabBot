(1) For this type of surgery, the cricoid, hyoid, and one mobile arytenoidremain; the epiglottis is sometimes excised depending on the extent of the tumor(16)-Patients who have undergone supracricoid partial laryngectomy with the excision of the epiglottis are at high risk foraspiration due to minimal airway protection(16)\u2013Near-total  laryngectomy is indicated for laryngeal tumors that have extended past the boundaries of the more conservativepartial laryngectomy surgeries; however, the midline posterior glottis, midline postcricoid region, ipsilateral posteriorone-half  to two-thirds  of the vocal cord, and ipsilateral subglottis must NOT be involved(2)",

Twenty of the patients were able to have food and liquid by mouth for all or part of their nutritional intake at the time of discharge from the hospital; by 2 months postsurgery, 21 patients were eating exclusively by mouth, and only 1 patient still had a gastrostomy tube at a 6-month  follow-up.  In this study, the two factors that appeared to relate to postoperative swallowing function were T stage (i.e., tumor size) and length of hospital stay (longer stays for those with poorer swallowing scores on early assessment)(15)",
            "In a study conducted in Italy with 32 patients who underwent supracricoid or supraglottic partial laryngectomy, researchers found no significant difference in outcomes of swallow between the two types of laryngectomy. In this study, the only factor that was significantly correlated to poorer swallowing outcomes was radiation therapy(18)",
            "In a study conducted in China with 30 patients who had undergone total laryngectomy and 60 patients who had undergone a conservation partial laryngectomy, researchers investigated the outcomes of a multi-modality  comprehensive intervention.(19) Comprehensive management included a combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy individualized to patient\u2019s cancer and medical status. Immediately postintervention and then again after a period of 47 months, researchers assessed quality of life and laryngeal function (i.e., speech, swallowing, breathing abilities). A total of 45 patients who had undergone partial laryngectomy survived to followup, and in this group 41/45 had intelligible speech. Of the group of 45 surviving patients who had undergone partial laryngectomy, 44/45 underwent tracheostomy during surgery and 38/44 had been decannulated. None of the patients required any type of feeding tube after 3 months postintervention, but the majority (~70%) of patients, in both total and partial laryngectomy groups, reported mild to moderate xerostomia. None of the patients reported moderate to severe dyspnea at follow-up  indicating good respiratory outcomes(19)",
            "Authors of a retrospective case series conducted in the United States with 3 patients who underwent partial laryngectomy and radiation therapy for laryngeal cancer reported that late onset dysphagia occurred in all 3 patients. Despite having a functional swallow without aspiration for between 11 and 15 years, all of these patients eventually developed dysphagia with aspiration and recurrent pneumonia. Most studies on partial laryngectomy and dysphagia measure outcomes in the short term; patients should be educated that late onset dysphagia is a possible outcome of partial laryngectomy(23)"

Compensatory techniques include maneuvers and postures to increase airway protection (e.g., supraglottic swallow, head rotation) as well as diet modifications.(16) Rehabilitative exercises will focus on increasing the strength of the remaining laryngeal structures and muscles. For detailed information on dysphagia therapy, see the series of Clinical Reviews on this topic(16)",
            "Voice exercises:  The following exercises improve the voice in most cases; however, overall improvement will depend on type and location of the tumor as well as how the larynx was reconstructed following surgery(1) \u2013Forced adduction exercises -Teaching the patient to bring the vocal cords and other remaining structures closer to midline using breath holds, pushing or pulling(1)  -ONLY to be performed while patient is doing exercises and NOT while patient is speaking to avoid developing overcompensation habits(1) -In addition to improving vocal fold closure for phonation, adduction exercises promote improved airway protection during swallowing(16) \u2013V ocal function exercises(3) -Improve coordination and vocal fold endurance -Involve a warm-up,  stretching and contracting the vocal folds and strengthening the cords by sustaining pitches",
