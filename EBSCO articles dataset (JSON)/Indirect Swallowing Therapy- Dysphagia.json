            "Dysphagia therapy can be conceptualized in two ways  direct vs indirect therapy or facilitative (sometimes called rehabilitative) vs compensatory therapy.(1,2) Direct dysphagia therapy comprises interventions that involve modification of volume and speed of the presentation of food or liquid that the patient is required to swallow, and indirect dysphagia therapy comprises oral motor exercises that indirectly improve the swallow (i.e., the patient is NOT given food or liquids to swallow during the therapy sessions).(1,2) Compensatory dysphagia therapy/treatment comprises interventions that alter the external factors related to swallowing and do not address the underlying dysphagia itself, while facilitative dysphagia therapy comprises interventions that are designed specifically to improve the swallow function/physiology and/or the ROM of the oral mechanism.(1) This Clinical Review focuses on indirect dysphagia therapy. Indirect dysphagia therapy is provided to patients with very impaired swallowing function who will likely aspirate any consistency of food or liquid provided to them.(2) The decision to treat a patient with indirect dysphagia therapy only is made based on the results of an instrumental swallow evaluation, such as a flexible endoscopic examination of swallowing (FEES) or modified barium swallow study (MBS)/videofluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS)(2)",
            "Therapy techniques that might be utilized in an indirect dysphagia therapy/treatment program include oral motor and pharyngeal ROM exercises, oral stimulation, base of tongue exercises, and pharyngeal/laryngeal strengthening exercises(1,2)"

            "Oral motor exercises:  Exercises that are widely used in the rehabilitation for dysphagia population; however, efficacy data in the research literature are lacking(1) \u2013Authors of a systematic review published in 2010 that included 16 studies that examined the effects of oral motor exercises (OME) on functional swallowing outcomes in children with dysphagia concluded that there was insufficient evidence that the exercises result in functional improvement of the swallowing mechanism(23) -The most positive treatment effect was found with the 12-month  use of a stimulating Innsbruck Sensorimotor Activator and Regulator (ISMAR) oral plate for children with cerebral palsy (CP) to improve the chewing domain(23) \u2013Authors of a review of the literature published in 2011 on tongue-strengthening exercises/treatment for dysphagia rehabilitation found that although their evidence was promising, there was not enough evidence to determine the efficacy of tongue-strengthening  exercises on dysphagia(24) \u2013In a study conducted in Canada with 6 adults with chronic dysphagia related to an acquired brain injury, researchers used a tongue-pressure  resistance training protocol/intervention with the goal of increasing both strength and accuracy of tongue movements in swallowing(32) -Tongue-pressure  resistance training tasks/protocol all involved the use of the Iowa Oral Performance Instrument (IOPI), a handheld manometer with an air-filled  pressure bulb; exercises targeted sustained, maximum, isometric pressures with the tongue strength as well as functional saliva swallows(32) -Each subject received/completed 24 sessions of tongue-pressure  resistance training/treatment over the course of 11\u201312 weeks(32) -At the conclusion of therapy, follow-up  measures indicated increases in anterior and/or posterior tongue strength for all 6 participants and 5 of the 6 patients demonstrated a functional improvement in protecting against aspiration. However, bolus clearance measures and vallecular and pyriform sinus post-swallow  residue clearance did not improve, with deterioration of these skills present in 5 of the 6 patients post treatment(32)  \u2013Can include exercises to improve ROM, strength, rate, and/or coordination of the lips, jaw, oral tongue, tongue base(1,2) -Logemann describes exercises that can be utilized in indirect dysphagia therapy in her dysphagia textbook:(2) -ROM lingual exercises (to be repeated 5\u201310  times per speech therapy session; patient should attempt to practice these exercises independently 4\u20135 times per day)(2) -Protrusion: open the mouth as widely as possible; elevate the tongue as high as possible; hold in place for one second(2) -Retraction: with mouth open wide, patient pulls his or her tongue back into the mouth/oral cavity as far back as possible; hold for one second(2) -Alternate lingual protrusion and retraction exercises(1,2) -Lateralization: patient moves the oral tongue back and forth between the corners of the mouth, stretching the tongue as far as possible(2) -Lingual strengthening exercises -Patient pushes his or her tongue against a tongue blade, popsicle, lollipop, or finger(2) -Patient pushes the tongue blade toward the front as well as along the sides of the tongue, holding the pressure for at least 1\u20133seconds each time/position(2) -Authors of a systematic review on isometric lingual strength-training  programs for dysphagia published in 2017 that included 10 studies reported that the evidence was promising, but the studies were too heterogenous to draw firm conclusions. Authors recommended further research with well-defined  subject populations as well as randomized, controlled study designs(46) -Bolus manipulation/control exercises(2) -Patient is given something large that can be controlled by the SLP to manipulate in the mouth(2) -A rolled 4\u201dx 4\u201d gauze pad or licorice rope can be used for the patient to manipulate in his or her mouth while the SLP controls one end(2) -Initially, the patient simply holds the item in place; as strength and coordination improve, patient moves the item from side to side and forward and backward(2) -To improve patient\u2019s ability to hold a cohesive bolus in the mouth, the SLP can place a small amount of puree or thickened liquid in the patient\u2019s cupped tongue with instructions to hold the bolus in place; following this exercise, patient should spit the bolus into a cup so as not to allow it to be swallowed(2) -To improve bolus propulsion, the SLP can provide the patient with a 4\u201dx 4\u201d gauze pad rolled up and soaked in orange or cranberry juice (for flavor); the patient is cued to push the gauze against the hard palate enough to squeeze a small amount of liquid out of the gauze(2)",

            "Laryngeal/pharyngeal strengthening exercises \u2013Logemann describes exercises that can be utilized in indirect dysphagia therapy in her dysphagia textbook:(2)  -Airway closure exercises(2) -Patient is to complete this series 5\u201310  times daily for 5 minutes at a time(2) -Patient sits in a chair, holds his or her breath to bear down for a second, and then exhales the breath(2) -As the patient improves with voluntary breath-holding,  he or she can push down on or pull up on the chair while holding his or her breath to increase airway closure further(2) -V ocal fold adduction exercises(2) -Patient sits in and bears down on a chair with one hand while vocalizing a strong clear \u201cah\u201d sound; patient repeats 5 times(2) -The patient then produces 5 harder glottal attacks on the vowel sound \u201cah\u201d(2) -Repeat these two exercises 3 times each; perform 5\u201310  times per day(2) -Falsetto exercise (for laryngeal elevation)(2) -Patient slides up the pitch scale from a low note to the highest possible (falsetto) note in his or her vocal range(2) -During the production of this high, falsetto voice, the patient\u2019s larynx is required to elevate almost nearly as much as during a swallow(2) -Shaker exercise (an exercise intended to improve pharyngeal dysphagia secondary to abnormal upper esophageal opening) -To perform the Shaker exercise, the patient is instructed to lay flat (or as flat as possible; do not use a pillow), lift the head by trying to look at the toes, keep the shoulders down, and bring the chin to the chest, then hold the head in this position for 60 seconds. The patient performs this portion of the exercise 3 times with 3 breaks of 60 seconds each between repetitions. As the final part of the exercise, the patient is instructed to perform 30 consecutive head lifts in the same manner as above without holding the head up for an extended period of time(42) -In a systematic review published in 2012 that included 9 studies on the effects of the Shaker exercise, authors reported the following: increases in the anterior excursion of the larynx, increases in the antero-posterior  diameter of the upper esophageal sphincter (UES) opening, and elimination of dysphagia symptoms. Although the results of the systematic review were promising, researchers were cautious in their interpretation of the outcomes because of the high degree of variability in methodology used in the studies reviewed(43) -In an RCT conducted in the United States, the researchers who developed the Shaker head lift exercise evaluated its effects/efficacy on abnormal UES opening.(42) Twenty-seven  patients with post-swallow  residue and aspiration caused by abnormal UES opening were assigned to a 6-week  treatment group to strengthen the suprahyoid muscle or to a \u201csham\u201d exercise control group. Due to the severity of their dysphagia, 18 of the 27 patients received enteral feeding prior to treatment. All 11 patients in the treatment group exhibited improved UES opening, improved anterior laryngeal excursion, and resolution of postdeglutitive aspiration. All were able to resume oral feeding. In contrast, there was no significant change in swallowing function for the independent control group(42) -In a non-treatment  study conducted in the United States, a researcher used surface electromyography (sEMG) to compare muscle activation in healthy female subjects without dysphagia in two different swallowing exercises. The two exercises used were an isometric jaw opening to resistance chin-to-chest  exercise and an isometric head-lifting exercise (Shaker exercise). Subjects had sEMG electrodes placed on their submental skin behind the mandible. The researcher was targeting the hyo-laryngeal  muscles and compared the amount of activation elicited from each exercise. sEMG measurements revealed significantly more activation of the sub-mandibular  hyo-laryngeal  muscles during the chin-to-chest  exercise versus the head-lifting  (Shaker) exercise.(44) These results suggest that the Shaker exercise would not be appropriate for patients in need of an exercise to target/strengthen the hyolaryngeal muscles \u2013Chin tuck against resistance (CTAR) : CTAR is an exercise designed to increase the strength of the suprahyoid muscles. In order to perform CTAR, the patient is instructed to perform a chin tuck against the resistance of a rubber ball or commerciallyavailable device developed for this purpose while seated in a chair. In an RCT with 22 participants who had post-stroke  dysphagia conducted in South Korea, researchers compared swallowing outcomes using traditional dysphagia therapy or CTAR. Each group of participants underwent 5 sessions per week for 4 weeks. At the conclusion of the study, the participants in the CTAR group made significantly greater improvements on VFSSs measured by the Functional Dysphagia Scale (FDS) and penetration-aspiration  Scale. Additional, larger trials are necessary to determine indications for and effectiveness of CTAR(45)  \u2013Masako maneuver (tongue-holding  maneuver):  An exercise intended to increase posterior pharyngeal wall contraction/ movement during deglutition resulting in improved contact between the posterior pharyngeal wall and the base of the tongue during the swallow(25) -This \"tongue hold\" maneuver is accomplished by having the patient maximally protrude the tongue and asking him or her to hold the tongue between the front teeth (central incisors) while swallowing(25) -The retraction of the base of the oral tongue is restricted, causing increased bulging and stretching of the posterior pharyngeal wall during swallowing(25) -In a research study conducted in the United States, 10 healthy males aged 19\u201326  years with no history of dysphagia were trained to perform this maneuver(25) -Patients were given 3-mL  boluses of barium liquid and asked to swallow 6 times; 3 times with the Masako maneuver and 3 times without the maneuver -Dynamic videofluoroscopic swallow evaluation images were taken of all 6 swallows and compared -In these normal healthy adult subjects, there was shown to be a significant difference in the amount of anterior bulge of the posterior pharyngeal wall when the subjects were performing the Masako maneuver -The anterior bulge of the posterior pharyngeal wall during swallowing was significantly greater with the Masako maneuver at mid and inferior C2 level of the spine -For detailed information on the Masako maneuver, see Clinical Review\u2026Swallowing Therapy: Masako Maneuver ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T709211 \u2013Mendelsohn maneuver:  Intended to increase the duration of time that the larynx is elevated and pulled forward during a swallow, allowing for increased clearance of the pharyngeal cavity and UES; it can be utilized as a laryngeal elevation exercise as well(1,26) -Can be done with or without food/liquid boluses; for indirect dysphagia therapy, the patient will be instructed to perform the maneuver using saliva swallows only -The patient is instructed to begin to swallow and \u201chold\u201d his or her swallow halfway through at the point of maximal laryngeal elevation -In a study conducted in the United States, researchers examined the effect of the Mendelsohn maneuver on normal swallowing physiology(26) -Researchers conducted concurrent videofluoroscopic and manometric studies/exams of swallowing in 8 healthy adult male volunteers ages 22\u201328  without any history of dysphagia -Measurements were taken of the UES opening, swallow-related  hyoid movement, laryngeal elevation, and bolus preparation with three 1-mL boluses of barium and three 10-mL  boluses of barium during normal swallows and during swallows in which the Mendelsohn maneuver was performed(26) -The results of the study indicated that all of these normal volunteers were able to alter their swallowing mechanism by using the Mendelsohn maneuver -The use of the Mendelsohn maneuver resulted in a slight voluntary prolongation in the duration of UES opening and a significant increase/improvement in laryngeal elevation and maximal hyoid movement during the swallows -The use of the Mendelsohn maneuver/posture did not appear to alter the pressure inside the pharyngeal cavity -Authors of a study conducted in Australia with 12 healthy volunteers reported on the effects of the effortful swallow and Mendelsohn maneuver on pharyngoesophageal swallow physiology. Both the effortful swallow and Mendelsohn maneuver resulted in significantly greater floor-of-mouth contraction (as measured by surface electromyography) and pharyngeal pressure (as measured by high resolution manometry) when compared to typical/non-maneuvered swallows. Additionally, both the effortful swallow and Mendelsohn maneuver resulted in the UES reaching maximal diameter significantly faster than the typical swallows. Additional research is warranted to determine the effects of these maneuvers on the swallow function of individuals with esophageal dysphagia(47) -For detailed information on the Mendelsohn maneuver, see Clinical Review\u2026Swallowing Therapy: Mendelsohn Maneuver ; CINAHL Topic ID Number: T709213 \u2013Functional dysphagia therapy: In a retrospective study conducted in Germany with 222 adult patients with dysphagia, researchers found positive effects of functional dysphagia therapy (FDT)(27) -The patients with dysphagia were divided into two groups: both groups were treated with FDT; one group of patients (n=117) had PEG feedings and the other non-PEG  group (n=105) was exclusively fed orally(27) -Patients with PEG tube feedings had severe dysphagia; those who were fed orally had mild to moderate dysphagia  -Patients in the study had dysphagia from various etiologies, including stroke, dementia, and head and neck cancer -FDT was provided by trained SLPs and included functional training exercises of motor skills for improved ROM, coordination, and strength of the lips, jaw, tongue, velum, larynx, and vocal folds(27) -In addition to the exercises, the patients were treated with sensory enhancement techniques, including thermal/tactile stimulation and compensatory strategies, such as chin tuck posture -Duration and frequency of therapy varied among patients and were determined by the SLP who was treating each"
