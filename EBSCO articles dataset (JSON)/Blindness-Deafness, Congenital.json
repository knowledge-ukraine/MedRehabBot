In typically-developing  children, social rules and language are often learned implicitly by watching and listening to how other children interact with each other(43) Issues with poor overall physical health and chronic pain often result in stress and fatigue in individuals with congenital deafblindness associated with Usher syndrome(41) Patients with congenital deaf-blindness  are also at increased risk for anxiety due to difficulty communicating needs and wants, and may exhibit challenging behaviors such as tantrums, hitting, biting, and hairpulling(9) In a study conducted in Sweden, researchers compared the physical and psychological health of adults with Usher syndrome type II (marked by moderate to severe congenital hearing loss that is either stable or gradually progressive as well as progressively deteriorating visual abilities) to that of a reference group that included a random sampling of 5,738 adults. Researchers found that there were significantly more instances of headache, fatigue, depression, suicidal thoughts, and suicide attempts in the group of individuals with Usher syndrome type II as compared to the reference group.(31) Additionally, the psychological differences were even greater when comparing only the men in each group(31) In a study conducted in the Netherlands with 4 individuals with congenital deaf-blindness  (2 children, 2 adults) and 16 of their most frequent conversational partners, researchers examined the effectiveness of the Intervention Model for Affective Involvement (IMAI) for improving communication interactions and behavior problems among these subjects. The goal of the study was to determine whether the intervention 1) increased affective involvement/positive emotions and decreased negative emotions and 2) improved communication efficacy between the participants with congenital deafblindness  and their conversational partners (e.g., parents, caregivers, teachers) across different settings (e.g., school, home, activity center). Researchers used a 7step  protocol that involved first training the conversational partners how to identify communicative intent in affective behaviors. Conversational partners were then taught how to better respond to these behaviors through implementation of newly learned strategies in interactions with the participants. At the conclusion of the study, researchers found that the intervention increased affective involvement and very positive emotions as well as decreased very negative emotions during communication interactions with trained communication partners(33)Note hearing status What is the extent of the patient\u2019s hearing loss?Thoroughly review current audiogram, audiological history, and audiology reports.

Because the diagnosis of deaf-blindness  does not necessarily refer to complete lack of hearing and sight, many individuals with this diagnosis do have some minimally preserved sensory capacities and are able to use them to communicate. Each of the participants in the study was provided with a videophone unit equipped with a 22-inch television monitor for use in the home. All participants were enrolled in educational facilities and used manual signed language as their primary mode of communication. The initial communication interaction included a \u201cbreaking the ice\u201d call and facilitated conversation between pairs of participants. Participants were then encouraged to use their videophone to contact the other participants at least once weekly for 1 month and were provided guided prompts to promote conversation.

Between 6 months and 2 years of age, children who are typically developing in other areas can be tested using a behavioral conditioning paradigm (Visual Reinforcement Audiometry), and some children with low vision can be tested with the same paradigm using a bright light reinforcer. Because of developmental delays among children with congenital deaf-blindness,  there may be greater reliance on ABR and otoacoustic emissions after 6 months of age. In addition, ABR and otoacoustic emissions tests can be used to determine the presence of auditory neuropathy/dyssynchrony.(1) Systematic behavioral observations can also be used by parents and teachers to check for different types of behavior in relation to various auditory stimuli. This procedure can identify children\u2019s responses to different frequencies and intensities of sounds(2)A pediatric eye and vision examination for children under the age of 3 years consists of a vision history of the child and family, vision assessment, pupil examination, and examination for red reflex (to check for abnormalities/ obstructions that block light flow within the eye).(1) Other tests include the Hirschberg corneal reflex test, ductions and versions examinations (eye movement tests), alternate cover test, and rapid retinoscopy.(1) An ophthalmologic evaluationoculomotor functioning, visual acuity, field/peripheral vision, color perception, visual adaptation, funduscopic and slit-lamp  examination and eye pressures. For the most difficult cases, cortical evoked response and electroretinogram might be necessary(1)A functional vision assessment can be performed by a pediatric ophthalmologist to determine how the child uses visual ability and what limitations might exist. Instruction to improve visual usage can be developed from this assessment.(1) For example, the Fagan test, a test designed to assess higher-order  visual functions, can be used to identify residual visual capacities in children with intellectual disability(2)Identify other senses that the child uses to gain information(17)",

Additionally, once attention has been gained, it can also be difficult for children with congenital deaf-blindiness  to maintain and shift attention during linguistic exchanges(40)The teacher allows the child to guide the intensity of the interaction. Appropriate examples of the child guiding the interaction include the child withdrawing by turning head away or the child laying hand on teacher\u2019s hand(19)Mutual sharing of emotions(19)Child\u2019s acts of independence such as getting dressed or being involved in the steps of dressing(19) Describe patient\u2019s nonverbal interactions through observation or videotaped analysis (e.g., classroom, clinic, home) and parent/caregiver or teacher report.

            "It is of the utmost importance to maintain sensitivity while parents of a child with deaf-blindness  explore options for augmentation and modes of communication for hearing impairment (i.e., Total Communication vs. oral communication [if the child has the capability]; cochlear implant vs. aids vs. no augmentation). There is no one set of communication options that is appropriate for every patient or family ",
            "Because of the low incidence of congenital deaf-blindness,  presented material is mainly based on expert opinion and small studies. There have been only a few case studies and single subject research studies with this population. Given the heterogeneity of children with both congenital blindness and hearing loss, individualization of treatment is warranted and a range of different approaches for a single child may be necessary. Texts on children with congenital deaf-blindness provide comprehensive guidelines for treatment of a variety of children and several curriculums and parent/teacher training programs have also been established.(18,24,25,28,29) Listed below are some examples of behavioral techniques and parent/teacher education programs to address some of the areas of communication deficits for children with congenital deaf-blindness"

        "treatment summary": [
            "Educator-oriented  intervention \u2013Educators are trained to interpret and respond more appropriately to the patient\u2019s subtle interactive behaviors(9,26,27) \u2013In a multiple baseline study conducted in the Netherlands of 4 deaf-blind  children (aged 6-9 years) and their 14 educators, 3 of the 4 children increased their appropriate interactive behaviors while decreasing their inappropriate behaviors after educator training. Educators in this study were taught to react adequately to the child\u2019s interactive behaviors (e.g., immediately repeating the child\u2019s behavior or utterance) and adapt the interactional context to facilitate interactive behaviors (e.g., provide communicative aids, offer choices, remove distracting stimuli)(26) -The same researchers conducted a second study using the same subjects and examined the long-term  effects of this intervention. The researchers found that for 2 of the 4 subjects, the positive effects of the intervention on both educator behaviors and target child behaviors were retained on follow-up  (10 weeks post intervention)(27) \u2013Researchers in Netherlands reported on the first 2 years of a small, ongoing study investigating the effectiveness of a program named Project CHANGE aimed at improving communication in adults with both congenital deaf-blindness and ID. Participants in the program were 6 adults (average age, 42 years) with both congenital deaf-blindness  and ID, none of whom had received any prior deaf-blind  education or intervention focused on improving communication geared specifically toward deaf-blindness.  Intervention took place at a group home with 8 residents with both congenital deaf-blindness  and ID. The staff at the group home included 15 caregivers, 2 educational psychologists, and a coordinator. The staff-to-resident  ratio for most of the day was 1:2. Prior to having the study participants move into the group home, the staff participated in a 4-day  training course on interaction and communication that focused on the principles of communicating with people with congenital deaf-blindness.  Nine months after the residents moved in, staff was given a half-day  course on tactile sign language and follow-up  training from the initial 4-day  session was provided after the first 10 months of the program. Throughout the first 22 months of the program that were reported in this study, caregivers were provided with individual on-the-job  training from the coordinator and video analyses were conducted by the educational psychologists once per month. The approach for each participant was tailored to the specific needs, strengths, and weaknesses of the individual. Expressive communication outcomes of the participants were measured by the Communication Matrix. After the first 22 months of Project CHANGE, results showed an improvement in interaction between staff and residents marked specifically by increased attention, confirmations, and affective involvement by the caregiver. Additionally, improvements were documented in the participants\u2019 level of expressive communication as well as the variety of their communicative behaviors(34) \u2013In a case study, authors described a 28-year-old  man with congenital deaf-blindness  who lived in a group home with 3 other patients with deaf-blindness.  The authors found that instances of challenging behaviors were significantly reduced and positive communication interactions increased following an intervention to educate the staff of the group home(9)",
            "Using preferred objects \u2013Joint attention can be first established on a variety of preferred objects. To scaffold a child\u2019s exploration of objects, adults can demonstrate how to experience the object through multiple senses. Using hand-under-hand  exploration, adults can indicate the visual, auditory, olfactory, and tactile features of the object depending on the child\u2019s abilities. It is important for the child to be free to leave and return to the adult\u2019s hands for exploration so that the child can moderate the level of stimulation(28)",
            "Recognize and reinforce initiations \u2013Parents and teachers may be taught to recognize a child\u2019s early initiations. Examples of such initiations may include reaching to locate an object or leaning toward others to indicate a desire to interact  \u2013Adults can reinforce such initiations by responding to their interpreted intent (e.g., giving the child an object). Gestures that spontaneously emerge in motivating situations are more likely to be recalled and reproduced. If a child uses \u201chome signs\u201d or idiosyncratic gestures, it is important that the adult first respond to the invented signs instead of shaping them into the conventional form(11,28) \u2013In a case study involving two 3-year-old  boys with congenital deaf-blindness,  their mothers were each trained to reinforce interactions with their sons to promote appropriate communication and other interactive behaviors(29) -Researchers applied the Diagnostic Intervention Model\u2019s 5-step  protocol as the basis of the intervention(29) -The 5 steps are: 1) determination of the question, 2) clarification of the question, 3) interaction analysis, 4) implementation of the intervention, and 5) evaluation(29) -The mothers were trained to respond to 8 different types of interactions: initiatives, confirmations, answers, turns, attention, intensity, affective involvement, and independent acting(29) -Positive intervention effects were seen for both boys at the conclusion of the study; specific results (i.e., strengths and weaknesses) were different for each boy, and researchers highlighted the importance of individualized treatment protocols for children with congenital deaf-blindness(29)",
            "Reinforcement of vocalizations \u2013After maximizing the child\u2019s access to auditory input through appropriate augmentation, adults can create opportunities for the child to vocalize by reinforcing babbling. Determine the functional intent of the vocalization and respond regularly. For example, if the caregiver determines the sound \u201cah\u201d is to gain attention, the caregiver should respond in a systematic way (e.g., touching the child\u2019s hand) after hearing the vocalization(28)",
            "Provide opportunities for the child to use a variety of communicative intents \u2013The following intents occur early in development but are often absent in the communication of a child with congenital deaf-blindness:  protesting; requesting objects, information, and actions; calling for attention; greeting; showing objects; giving objects; answering; labeling; and commenting on objects and actions(11) \u2013Adults in the child\u2019s environment have to create opportunities for different functions (e.g., a situation that may elicit a protest), providing opportunities for choice making(11)",
            "Environmental modifications \u2013Classrooms can be structured to increase opportunities for communication by 1) placing students so they face each other (U-shaped  desks or round tables), 2) using structured routines, and 3) using calendars or communication shelves(3) \u2013Communication shelves are arranged in order of a routine and contain objects that signify a specific activity(3) .
