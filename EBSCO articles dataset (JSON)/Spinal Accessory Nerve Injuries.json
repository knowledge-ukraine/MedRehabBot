            "Cranial nerve XI, the spinal accessory nerve (SAN), tends to be vulnerable to injury, as it takes a long and superficial course in the posterior cervical neck region. Because the nerve contributes the most innervation to the trapezius muscle, any kind of injury to it can lead to shoulder dysfunction(1,12)",
            "Researchers, using intraoperative nerve monitoring during neck dissections of 18 patients, found that in all of the patients the SAN innervated all 3 parts of the trapezius(14)",
            "A researcher in Slovenia reports there are three different branching patterns of the SAN in the neck, and that these variations should be recognized by the operating surgeon during neck dissection in order to minimize shoulder morbidity(1,17) \u2013Type 1 (66%): the branch exits at the posterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle \u2013Type 2 (22%): the branch takes off from the common trunk of the SAN before it enters the sternocleidomastoid muscle \u2013Type 3 (12%): the motor branch for the trapezius muscle exits behind the posterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle but takes a more medial course to form macroganglia with the cervical nerves \u2013One other finding was that the cervical nerves may contribute to innervation of the trapezius muscle in up to 39% of persons"

Once the nerve is damaged, paresis of the trapezius muscle and, infrequently, the sternocleidomastoidoccurs. This results in a loss of normal shoulder and scapular biomechanics, a loss of elevation of the shoulder, and atrophyof the denervated musculature",

Fibrosis of muscle fibers and the neural sheath as well as nerve demyelination can result,compounding the trapezius muscle weakness(11)",
