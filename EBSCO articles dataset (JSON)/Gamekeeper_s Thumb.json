            "Ligamentous injury (sprain, partial tear, or tear) of the UCL of the thumb as a result of hyperextension and abduction forces.(13) The injury may be the result of a sudden traumatic event or may result from chronic strain of the ligament leading to chronic MCP instability and eventual tearing(12,13)",
            "The UCL is composed of two parts: the proper collateral ligament (PCL) and the accessory collateral ligament (ACL)(14)",
            "The PCL originates proximally to the base of the head of the MCP joint and inserts on the volar side of the proximal phalanx. The ACL originates just palmar of the PCL and runs parallel to the PCL to its insertion on the proximal phalanx(14)",
            "The UCL acts as a static stabilizer of the MCP joint. When the MCP joint is flexed, the PCL and the dorsal capsule are taut to stabilize the joint. When the MCP joint is extended, the ACL and the volar plate are taut to stabilize the joint(14)",
            "UCL injuries represent 60% to 90% of ligamentous injuries to the MCP joint of thumb,while radial collateral ligament (RCL) injuries account for 10% to 40% of injuries.(14) Radial and collateral ligament injuries can both occur concomitantly. The authors of a retrospective review of thumb injuries seen in a cohort of professional American football players found that in 25% of the cases, the players sustained combined UCL and RCL injuries(11)"
