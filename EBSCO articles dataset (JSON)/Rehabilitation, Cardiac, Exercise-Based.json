            "Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) after myocardial infarction (MI) is a multifaceted medical service. Components of CR include physician referral and overall supervision, lifestyle/ risk factor modification, exercise testing and training, psychosocial counseling, and patient education. Major goals of an exercise-based  CR program are improvement of physical functioning and secondary prevention of reinfarction. CR personnel include a physician, nurse, physical and occupational therapists, exercise physiologist, nutritionist, and social service caseworker(18)",
            "Strong evidence supports the exercise component of CR for reducing disability and improving quality of life and physical activity after MI(1,22)",
            "Exercise-based  CR also appears effective for reducing cardiovascular mortality and death from all causes after MI, as well as reducing the risk of reinfarction(1,2)",
            "CR exercise training can have direct positive effects on cardiac function by improving left ventricular remodeling soon (1 week) after MI and continuing longer than 3 months(3,4)",
            "Exercise training after MI is associated with reduced arterial inflammation(5) and stiffness(21)",
            "In general, persons who survive a heart attack often have never exercised regularly and need advice and supervision during the initial phases of exercise training(6)",
            "This Clinical Review focuses on prescription of aerobic and resistance exercise training for clinically stable patients with recent MI who have not undergone coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery"

            "A bleed or thrombus forms at the site of atherosclerotic stenosis in acute MI, abruptly occluding coronary blood flow andproducing transmural myocardial ischemia that leads to STEMI.

This is because events of unstable angina pectorisare usually short term and do not cause detectible myocardial injury(7)",

In cases with exercise-inducible myocardial ischemia, the RPP just below onset of the ischemic threshold canbe prescribed as the upper limit of exercise training intensity, similar to patients with exertional angina pectoris.(1,18) SeeClinical Review\u2026Angina Pectoris, Stable , referenced above",

            "Research on specific benefits of exercise \u2013Authors of an RCT involving 42 patients after a first MI found that exercise training can increase interleukin-10  (IL-10),  a cytokine with anti-inflammatory properties, after acute MI(5) -The exercise group (n = 22) underwent an 8-week,  3 sessions a week, aerobic exercise training program, while the control group (n = 20) underwent conventional care -At 8weeks followup, IL-10  levels were significantly higher in the exercise group, indicating an improved inflammatory profile. Low levels of IL-10  are also associated with poor prognosis after acute MI(5) \u2013Authors of an RCT (N = 96) in Portugal found that an 8-week  exercise-based  CR program with 3 sessions weekly, started 4 weeks after MI was able to reduce arterial stiffness in compliant patients (21) -Reduction in arterial stiffness was significant only if patients attended at least 80% of exercise sessions -Arterial stiffness is an independent predictor for cardiovascular (CV) and all-cause  mortality",

ED was measured by International Index of Erectile Function Questionnaire \u2013The control group improved significantly less than the experimental group on the 6MWT and more often reported no change or a slight increase in ED",
            "Guidelines are available for exercise testing and exercise training after a cardiac event.

Rather, exercise intensity may start mild and be progressed cautiously using RPE or talk test. Talk test is ability to talk while exercising without becoming breathless.
